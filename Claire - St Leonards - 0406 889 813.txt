My experience/comments:
Had been eyeing of her add for a month or two so decided to make a booking. Easily made via text.

Greeted at the door by a women who was not as attractive as I had imagined. Old looking.

Show to the bed room and offered a shower. Come back and reveils some lingerie which really didnt work. The  proceeds to get naked.

saggy tits, large tights with spider veins, and a largish tummy.

She lies down and proceeds to provide encouragement and hand play. I get hard and on with a condom for some very average cbj, i proceed to rub her clit whixh after a while seems to get her off. She the  lubes me up and we start to fuck cowgirl until so stops and explains she has a bad knee. We continue in missionary until i cum.

She then gets up cleans me off and asks if she can have a smoke.

We chat for a while and she then says 5min left, i get her to give me a quick wristy to get me hard, then a fucked her hard and fast doggy to completion.

Her picturse on cracker definately show her in a better light.

For the price I paid i could have had a better experience elsewhere.

Shit, $300 for an hour. For an arthritic old bag? Sorry but she saw u coming. U shoud have walked at the start. Easy to say from my armchair I know, but these over charging trolls need a lesson.

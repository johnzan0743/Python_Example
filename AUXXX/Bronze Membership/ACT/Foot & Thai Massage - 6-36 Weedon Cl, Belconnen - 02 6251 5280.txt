My experience/comments : My experience/comments : I arrived at the clinic on a Saturday morning. I had read good reviews about the place so when I got there I had somewhat high expectations however I was disappointed to meet the ladies working. They were shabby and couldn't speak much English.
Anyway I was there so I paid for an hour, I discussed before going in that I'm interested in nude massage with oral. They seemed ok. When we went in, she undressed and started to massage me. She was Ok with me exploring her, so my hand wandered. It was alright, nothing too special until the big turnoff was when I played with her pussy, she was on her feet giving me a massage I was reaching for her. First of all there was absolutely no reaction, no emotion, didn't give any impression if she was actually enjoying or not. However, soon after I brought my hand back and it smelled. I was maybe 15min into the massage, with 45 min to go, I couldn't help but count minutes so that I could get out of there.
Towards the end when the time came for oral, she said she doesn't do oral. I reminded her that we discussed and she said that she never agreed to it. Anyways, I was quite put off by then and I just asked her not to bother. I got up, dressed and walked out.
Wasted my money, time and overall bad experience. Wont be going back.

This is a legit massage joint. Is the OP sure he wasn't referring to Back and Foot?

I have never heard Foot and Thai offer any service except legitimate ones. Are you sure of the place?

You yourself mentioned F&T in a post on another thread. BTW, that place hasn't been called B&F for a while now. What gives?

The newspaper report:

The charges relate to stuff that happened in 2015 and earlier under previous management.

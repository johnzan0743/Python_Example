My experience/comments : I was in Canberra and a heap of meetings fell through. I thought I would take a punt and found Amy on Locanto. Amy was petite, smiley and good looking. Her massage skills and HJ were also good. She did miss some sections of massage and was a little clinical towards the end, but that was related to the awkwardness as the venue was not as private as I'd have liked. 

I thought it would be a private apartment, but it ended up being a massage parlour on Northbourne. That itself was not a problem but the room (and the table) ended up being right outside the receptionists head - we were probably less than 1m from the reception desk (through the wall) and I could hear conversations occurring and it meant that I was not able to fully relax because of this. 

Technically everything was okay, but the ambience was not what I had hoped for and meant I didn't get the full experience. I would try her if she was in a more private setting though.

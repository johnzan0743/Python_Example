 Traditional Chinese Massage - Canberra - 02 6257 9841
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name :  May

Establishment : Chinese massage civic (big red sign)

Date of Visit : 18/12/16

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 175 City Walk Canberra City, 0262579841

Hours of Business : Business hours. 

Rates : $80 for 1 hour + $20 HE 

 Age : Mid 40's 

 Size/shape : Short, slightly portly 

 Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

 Services Provided : A very poor massage, with a disinterested happy ending. 

 Value for money/recommend? : No. 

 My experience/comments : Popped in for a massage after a weekend of gardening and to see what was on offer. I received a very poor massage, asked her to use more pressure maybe three times before I gave up and just asked for the HE and was told $30. Hoped the happy ending would be better than the massage (the bar was  really low), but it was equally bad. No technique, which along with an obviously bored and disinterested look in her face made sure it took me a while to get there.

 The place is also not very clean and with the high prices is not worth revisiting.

These places are popping up everywhere in Canberra. I wonder if they aren't run by the same people or if the triads or something aren't moving into the Canberra market. The one on Northbourne and this one seem to have popped up in the last year.

I think this one is independent....the one above the TAB in Garema and the one in Northbourne are run by the same person....MILF, Lily

Very interesting that there seems to be a market for this sort of thing in Canberra in spite of the large red light districts in Fyshwick and Mitchell

Did your "May" offer BJ? Mine said no when I asked.

Went to see May yesterday but she was already booked....about to walk, when Kim, a very presentable young lady appeared. Decided to chance her. Hard massage was unbelievably good, but not erotic in any way. I finally indicated my interest in more and was quoted $50 for HE which I accepted. She did not offer any other services. The HE was fairly mechanical and she resisted my advances towards touching her.....I will stick to May in the future, but Kim is an excellent Masseuse.

Did she get naked or topless for the $50 ? Or the $50 was just for a HJ ?

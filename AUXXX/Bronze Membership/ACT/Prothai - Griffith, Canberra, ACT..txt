jamyx, the first thing to do would be to search the forum to see if there are any reviews, start using the telephone number and if that is not successful, the name and address if known. The search facility is near the top on the right hand side "Advance Search" of the Title Bar.

If nothing shows then it is unlikely anyone has been there, unless of course some lazy member has not contributed a review. That is why it is essential to make formal reviews regardless of whether the experience is good, bad or indifferent. The completion of the template facilitates searches.
It gives a range of members' experiences which may vary between us. The more reviews, the greater the database and usefulness of the forum.

The only option would be you to tray and report back with your own complying review. But always keep in mind YMMV.

I tried this place a number of months ago when I was still living in Canberra.  Although it has certain features suggesting R&T, eg a flashing "massage" sign, it is in fact totally straight, with a requirement to keep one's underpants on during the massage.  I thought it overpriced for a non-erotic massage, since the massage itself was only average in quality.

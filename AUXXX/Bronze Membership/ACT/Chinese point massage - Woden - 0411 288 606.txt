Rates : $80 he + $20 HJ

Age : early 20s 

Size/shape : slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : massage and hj

Value for money/recommend? : not really.

My experience/comments : have seen this place while shopping and thought I'd give it a go. Was greeted by an attractive older lady who took my money and ushered me into a room. Massage table was a bit rickety and the room itself wasn't very welcoming and a little cold to be honest. A younger girl came in, she seemed a little shy and I think she said her name was Anna (sorry). She proceeded to give me a very soft and not very great massage. On the flip she whispered if I wanted a HJ and I asked how much. She told me $20 and I thought why not. She then gave me an ok HJ. Her heart wasn't in it to be honest and it took a bit long. Cleaned me up and I left.

i get the impression the lady who I met going in would be better but I doubt I'll be back to see

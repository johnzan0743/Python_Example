My experience/comments : 

Went for a 40 minute massage at the end of the day to ease out some knots. Had to wait a bit efore someone was free so ended up taking 30 minutes. 
With only 30 minutes Anita said she would focus on my lower back down to my thighs. No towel was provided so I was not covered.
Anita found some knots in my back I didn't know I had and concentrated on getting these out. I swim and cycle so tend to get tight legs and back. She obviously knew what she was doing here and it was a real massage, she also did my glutes and hamstrings.
On the flip I was pleased that she didn't just give up and go for the extras, instead she continued on my thighs and even my hips which do get quite tight. I was happy with this as usually no one goes near this area.
Of course doing this with no towel meant I had a full on hard on which she gracefully ignored. But it felt quite sexy having the attention around there and her not seeming to be shy about it.
At the end she asked if I wanted a happy ending which I said yes. I was fairly good, with good attention though somewhat clinical in that there was no tease.
All in all it was a really good massage and nice to get a happy ending. $30 was the usual price and good value. 
I will return.

My experience/comments : 
I was in the area, so I thought I would stop by and check this place out. Upon entering, there is a low gate type setup next to the front counter, so you just have to wait until someone hears the bell on the door and comes to let you in. It wasn’t long before I was greeted by a mature yet attractive woman who asked how long I would like.  I said 30mins and was lead to the massage room. I handed over $50 and was told I could place my clothes on the chair, then lay face down on the massage table, while she got the change for me. Mei returned to the room and placed the change on my clothes, then asked if I would like a hard or soft massage. I asked for a hard massage. I don’t think she was very confident with her massage skills, as she seemed to avoid any knots I had. The massage also wasn’t very hard, but it wasn’t the softest one I’ve ever had either. At about the 20min mark I was asked to turn over. It was then that I was asked if I would like any extras. It seemed a like a bit of an afterthought, or cursory offer. Maybe that was just because I hadn’t seemed adequately ‘responsive’ in the lead up to the offer. Or it’s possible she’d just had a long day and was lacking some enthusiasm. But it didn’t take long to get the desired response once a really fit body and great fake rack was revealed. 


[COLOR=rgb(51, 51, 51)]Overall, if you are looking for some fun with a mature woman with a nice body and a really good fake rack, then it’s worth a visit. But if you a looking for a good massage, then there are better options nearby and the place is a little rundown.

My experience/comments : 
Had some luck with another place on a drive past so took the punt again. 

Walked to waiting room with a counter and gate entry. Really pretty girl with a great bid came out after 10 mins so I chose 1 hr. 

Into room and started massage. Really basic massage with no style at all. Now I started to worry. No feeling or touches and little talk at all. Very mechanical. Decided to wait for the roll. 

After 40mins I turned and she gestured a tug. I nodded and gently put on finger under her top to see if she'd nude up.

This is where I cried. She shook her head....... 

So I refused the extras and left with a sad ending. So I'm 1 from 2 in Perth and will be a lot more careful on the blind punts.

My experience/comments : 
Ivy is a hidden gem. I've seen her about four times.
The joint is upstairs on King St opposite Newtown railway station. Ring the door bell and a guy will answer the door. This seems to be mainly a Thai male masseur place, but they do have girls too - so say so.
Ivy is not a girl, and not Thai either.
She is friendly, good English and good at her job. I lay down, Ivy gets to work with oil. Good normal massage then a bit of stroking action. Agree on a price (well, that's what I did the first time, now she knows me). Roll over. Ivy allows a fair bit of touching. Gear off is on offer for $50, or just the hj for $20. Ivy's hj is very good with a lot of wrist rotation. Even without the gear off tip I normally manage a good feel up. Always a good blow then a hot towel clean-up.
The front rooms, the only ones of been in, are ok but small. Maybe the guy-guy action is out the back (ha ha).
I don't think there are showers.
Note that the girls on the web site are fake.

Ivy not a girl? I find that hard to believe given what I've found downstairs.
I suppose I just need to be back and check.
And yes, she's not Thai. My original post said Malaysian, which is what she said.

Just to make sure I wasn't being fooled, lunchtime today I went back to see Ivy. Those big jugs are real, and there is nothing tucked away downstairs. I have no idea what happens in the rooms at the back, but Ivy is definitely female.

Thanks Dogboy

Maybe we should change the title to remove the word ‘TS’ as she is obviously not!!

My experience/comments :

Been a while since my last punt due to many reasons  and I thought I'll  approach slowly at a old place known to me. Was in luck as old face was still on the roster.  

Note: they don't accept health cards anymore 

Proceeded to the rooms as they bigger and cleaner than most places and got ready for the proceedings. She has put on a bit but still looks good. Regular massage was excellent as usual (hard and got the knots out).  

Things turned out to be better when it came to the ending. I was offered a lot extra than usual (may be the lack of customers) or nude happy ending. Started off very slowly and was asked to use oil , which I said why not. Was allowed to touch and stroke her body but insert her privates were off limits. The teasing and soft whispering continue with occasional rimming and playing with my balls was a bonus.  Blew off a load and ended blissfully. 

Leaving I mentioned I should blow off before and after the massage and she said why not.  Made a note to visit soon.

Decided to go here after work on a Thursday night. Place is located central sydney, a few steps from Wynyard station. The shop itself looks very legit. On the website they advertise that they offer health rebates, I didn't bother asking. Walked in and asked for a 30min massage, paid the $45 and was taken into the room by Sunny who was a resonably pretty Thai girl in her late 20's.

Having been here a few times before I took off all my clothes with the presumption that all the girls offered extras. Sunny walked in and I gave her a wink and she nodded, so she knew exactly what I wanted. Massage was great - I asked her to focus on my upper boddy and she gave a firm massage. She was clearly a trained massesuse. She then proceeded to my lower body and legs afterwhich she started to slow the massage down as we were entering the "happy phase." Told me to flip over and asked whether oil was ok and I said yes. She started massaging my stomach and slowly moved down to my groin area. Dumped the oil all over my cock and got to work. Girls here don't take their gear off but I am ok with that. HJ was too fast and I asked her to slow down to which she did, took me a while to get over the hill but I finally did. Wiped me off with a hot towel and finished the last 5 min of my time allocation with a nice head massage. Paid her the $50 and off I went. 

Overall a good massage and standard HJ. I like Photara because the rooms are well appointed, clean and spacious. 

JD Rating 7/10

I don't know. To my mind, $50 for a clothed HJ seems a little over-priced given the other shops in the vicinity.

Yep, $20-$30 is the going rate for a clothed happy ending for sure. $50? Sorry luv, either drop your price or drop your clothes.

I probably could have haggled to $30 but as a principle I don't haggle when it comes to punting. $50 for me is measured through satisfication I receive for the experience.

Person's Name : Mary

Establishment : Wallsend Asian Massage

Date of Visit : Feb 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 63, Nelson St, Wallsend NSW2287

Hours of Business : 9-8 (I think)

Rates : 30 minutes for $40 massage, $30 for naked HJ or $20 clothed, BJ available another $20

Age : 30 ish

Size/shape : petite, c cup, fairly pretty, hot body

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian maybe Chinese? 

Services Provided : Massage and happy ending

Value for money/recommend? : yes the massage was good for the money. but is probably a  6 out of 10 in terms of quality but a 7-8 for the value.

My experience/comments : 
venue was extremely dark but seemed clean. standard massage table with comfort hole for you face etc .

 I didn't ask for a HE upfront but she gave me a tickle towards the end and asked if I wanted to be extra relaxed. I said yes and she said 20 for just HJ or 30 with her naked. I went the 30 option.
BJ was on offer for another 20. I believe she would do Bbbj or cbj for that price as she mentioned with or without Condom

the HE was great. Lots of slow tickling and teasing towards the end of the massage before flipping me over. She then stripped off and I was allowed to touch anywhere but no fingers inside, but she did allow me to suck her nipples. Plenty of edging and a few more offers for BJ; well played but I stayed strong ;-).

After a quick clean up we had 5 minutes left so she gave me a  relaxing neck and head massage which was better than the main massage.

All in all worthwhile fun was had by all.

Well that's interesting, I saw a review of this place a while back (maybe over on PP? can't remember) and it was a bit average so I gave it a miss... might have to go and pay them a visit tonight   What day of the week did you see Mary?

Person's Name : Cicci

Establishment : Wallsend Baby Massage

Date of Visit : July 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 63, Nelson St, Wallsend NSW2287

Hours of Business : 9-8

Rates : 60 minutes rub $80. $20 for naked HJ, BJ available another $20

Age : 30+?

Size/shape : petite, c cup, ok body

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian maybe Chinese? 

Services Provided : Massage and happy ending

Value for money/recommend? : no awful massage, there were a few points I literally had to stop her, basically rub up and down the Center of the back, then dig an elbow into  the hollow of your back and wiggle it for about 2 minutes then same again... actually painful... 
HJ was ok but that's the only even near positive. No tickle etc before the flip etc.

My experience/comments : 
I've reviewed this place before maybe 6 months ago and it was ok.. not the best but it was cheap and cheerful, standard massage table with comfort hole for you face

venue is the same but this one I had Cicci. 
As mentioned above awful massage with an ok HJ.. 

What really made it extra awful was the other punter who popped in 15 minutes after me. 
The boss (don't know name came out for him). Seemed like he was a regular and they all had a 3 way conversation for the first 30 minutes.... yes the walls are so thin and walls don't reach the ceiling so you can hear normal conversation...
i didn't have that issue the first time round... as I was the only person there.  

not sure what what he was getting but after the 30 minute mark the chat ended and the moaning and groaning from them both was gettting pretty loud... 
maybe he had whoever I had the first time round, but for me cicci is there Fri-Sun so avoid it like the plague on those days is my advice... 

I'll not be returning a third time either way

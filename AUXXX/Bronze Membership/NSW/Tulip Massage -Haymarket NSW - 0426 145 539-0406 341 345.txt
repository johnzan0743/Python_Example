Having had a bad experience at the other shop, I looked out for others in the vicinity. Saw Tulip had an opening special so gave it a go. Found Jenny - awesome body, not so much a looker though. But that's alright - nice rack. English was passable as is with most asian massage shops.

Had a decent part 1 massage actually. Asked for a hard massage and she delivered. Because I opted for the 30 minute option though it wasn't before long that she asked for extras. Got the nude with HJ and started from there. Was a bit transactional when she asked for the money but after that all good.

Oil went on and the touching begins! Was allowed anywhere and obviously I spend a fair amount of time in that nice rack.  Towards the end she got on top and simulated cowgirl. Would I be back? Most likely!

Person's Name : Linda / Lydia (Thai)

Establishment : Tulip Massage, Level 1, 750 George Street Haymarket

Date of Visit : Mid August 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Tulip Massage, Level 1, 750 George Street Haymarket. Phone: 0426 145 539

Hours of Business : 10am(?) to 2am

Rates : $60 an hour

Age : Looked late 20s

Size/shape : C+ cup, chubby

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : HE

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, given the circumstance

After some drinks in the city, I stumbled upon Tulip Massage on George Street, Haymarket. It was very late in the night, around 1am.

I got into the lift and to the reception desk. Spoke with the manager for a line up of girls. I had a choice of 3 - all Thai girls. I chose the one that looked best, well at least she did when she had her uniform on.

So off to the massage room for an hour session.

Things got off smoothly and she gave me soft relaxing massage. A little bit of touching. Then 30 minutes into it, she asked if I wanted extras, so I said yes. I chose the clothes off option. In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have as she turned out to be better with the tight dress on. Paid $50 for it and once she had her clothes off, it was clear I was deceived by my poor judgement.

Anyways, she started fondling and began with some sensual touching. She then focused on stroking my beast and I was allowed to touch her. I fondled her breasts just a bit. As I hadn't come yet, she put some oil onto her hand to help it along. 10 minutes later, still didn't come, until eventually I gave up and we just talked for the remaining minutes.

The girl was ok, with nice face and personality. But, just wasn't my type.

Alright for $110 (total damage) considering it was 1am-2am.

Another tiny girl this time Thai.  Very sweet and friendly and cute.  Short girl that has a good command of English and is willing to please.  Everything was on offer and she didn't talk dollars but i left her a healthy tip for her troubles.  On the massage side it was good but it was really the service side where she excelled.  YMMV but i had a good time

OK, thanks for the feedback.  As I mentioned in another post, I thought that it might not be allowed to mention the name of ML since I did say that everything was on offer and it's a massage establishment and not FS.  I found from my contribution on other forums in the past that people do try to be discrete and that those that are really interested will PM or will figure it out because there's enough clues to match to location or roster.

To explain more of the experience, her nature is friendly and she's always smiling and polite.  The massage part is quite good and is firm without being hard.  She times it well so that there is both time for massage as well as service.  On the service side, she does what most good MLs do with oil and body sliding.  Where she stands out is being comfortable with being touched, kissed and licked almost everywhere.  No kissing.  She will also offer more if she's comfortable with you but it comes at a cost.

(Sorry Mods if this is duplicate thread, please file as needed)
Person's Name : Anna

Establishment : CBD Japanese Massage

Date of Visit : Thursday 24/09 - 10pm

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Level 1/750 George st Haymarket, ??18yo,CBD Japanese massage ,cute uni girls ,More girl for you choose !IN/OUT ?? ?? - Sydney body rubs - backpage.com.au

Hours of Business : 10am - 3am

Rates : $40/30mins + + + Extras (50 for HJ, 120 for CBJ, More for FS)

Age : Early 30s

Size/shape : Average - small C cup Tits

Nationality or Ethnicity : MLC

Services Provided : Massage, HJ, Bodyslide, CBJ (FS on offer)

Value for money/recommend? : Nah

My experience/comments : I was near the city and in need of some stress relief. knowing that a few of the better rated establishments had shut up shop by now, I had a quick look around on backpage and found this place would be open. Figured if they advertised they can't be half bad!
Read the article and their lift is broken, so into the alley behind I went and attempted to find the right door. Hand firmly on my wallet and phone I walked up the dodgy stairwell until I found the place. Took a seat and was informed only 2 girls were on tonight. Neither were too attractive and whilst the mamasan offered to get more girls form their other location, I couldn't be fucked waiting. Chose the younger and more attractive of the two and paid for 30 mins only.
*Side Note* Especially at these sorts of establishments - your "massage" shops that offer a rub n tug, I need to take my own advice and not always choose the youngest and most attractive of the ladies on show. As I found in a previous punt, sometimes the older and less attractive ones have MUCH more skill than the others! A punt I forgot to review at shop in Mascot ended with the older, 40 something Mamasan giving me a Nude HJ because all the girls had gone home. Close your eyes and just embrace it! Anyway, back to the punt.
Into the room I went, stripped off and laid face down. The massage was, in a word, poor. It was your stock standard push down and poke around the muscles. How I long for the places that actually do this well and aren't just a place for you to get your rocks off. Flipped over and she asked if I wanted extras. I asked "what's on offer" and hse rattled off "$50 for HJ, $120 for Bodyslide + BJ" I went for the BJ option and as she was about to start stripping she asked if I wanted sex, looking at her, and my wallet, I said no.
*2nd Side Note* That is the other thing I hate, for what I paid I know I can get better value elsewhere as by the time you are hit with the massage price then extras, it ends up being more than it is worth
The BJ was nice, she reached up and played with my nipples as well (which I find absolutely amazing! Despite the quality of the rest of the punt). A short time later I blew my load into the condom and laid there while she cleaned it all up.
All in all, I wouldn't say it was a bad punt! I have had and read much worse, but I just struggle to find value in it. I chose this place because I was out, on my phone and wanted to find somewhere open. When I got to George St, there were other places still open that don't advertise, so next time it is late on a weeknight, I might have a bit more of a wander.

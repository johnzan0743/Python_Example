My experience/comments :

this place is located on a busy road so if your shy it may not suit. Its upstairs and the rooms are clean. Much to your usual room. 
given its just a massage parlour there are no shower facilities here. I paid for 1 hour which costs 60 or 80 for 1.5hrs. During the massage cindy who is pretty attractive, slim, 30s id say, gave a pretty decent massage. She doesn't give a proper massage per say, its more of a relaxing one. Soft strokes and when she moves lower it gets pretty good. If your a regular she will play with your butt and in between (doesnt insert a finger) and its really good. Hands often slightly touched my balls which gets you worked up. By the time I flipped over the old fella was awake. She asked if I wanted the ending happily finished and I said yes. She didnt get into it straight away but works her way up and down. Her hands are magic tho, slow strokes with oil. If she feels you getting close she stops and teases till you blow. 

If they are busy there is a waiting room but usually straight in. Get undressed and the massage starts. Pretty good, I like mine soft and relaxing. During the massage cindy would navagate down below and get you worked up. Doesnt hurt to say that feels nice etc. At the end she offered the happy ending, no price offered but its 20.00. Great massage and ending. Will return for sure.
Always go back. Cant fault it. Theres a back door to edit too so you dont walk past any waiting punters

I think it's the one on pennant hills rd not carlingford road, theres only one RNT in Carlingford.

I don't have the exact address but to give you some idea, it is right next to bunnings, so you can actually park at Bunnnings carpark,
then its a 100m walk, right on the main road Pennant Hills Road, where Marsden rd joins pennant hills road.
You walk up the stairs next to the pizza shop.

I've been there once, but left as it was all milfs.

My experience/comments :

So with a bit of a sore back i saw a sign outside which said $39 massage, not really going to R&Ts for years but i figured well i could do with a massage and lets see what else is on offer, the girl who greeted me at the door was very nice and a bit flirtatious which is a great start, i had to wait a short while, their place is clean and the rooms are private the premises is a terrace house with side entry opposite the Eastgate shopping center. 

She started me with a different girl, who was light skin thai with ok English, she was about 20 and a little larger but with a nice set of tits, i asked her weather i should keep my undies on or not still not sure if this was a R7 T joint or not she said its fine to take em off so i did, her massage was not the best but acceptable after about 20 mins she asked me to roll onto my back and was massage my stomach which was a bit funny but saw mr happy standing up she then asked if i wanted to have happy ending, i happily said yes and she proceeded about a minute into this she was subsed out by the original lady who came in and took over and said i will look after you and some other nice things, she was quite good looking really with nice full B cups and said it was $50 extra and i said no worries, she then gave me a inner thigh massage and a very nice handjob and was very good afterwards chatting and flirting some more, was a bit disappointed that she left her clothes on but still a good time really.

Probably will get back there one day, they were alright but for $90 its probably better to go to a full knock shop.

If you head over there try and get the maddem, sorry i cant remember her name to do everything rather then the young ones.

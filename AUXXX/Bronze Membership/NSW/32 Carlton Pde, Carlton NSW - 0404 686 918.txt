Sorry folks.

FU courtesy of me, "thinking" they were all reviews of 32 Carlton Pde.

Thank you JimmyC and bent_leg for the heads up (took a while to sink in I am afraid).

All shops now have their own separate thread as they did before I erroneously merged them.

Nice review Jimmy. Mandy also works at 2/769 Pacific Hwy Chatswood on Tuesdays. The description is a match and that tummy tat is the giveaway

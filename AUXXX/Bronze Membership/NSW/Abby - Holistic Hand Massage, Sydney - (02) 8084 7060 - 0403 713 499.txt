My experience/comments :
I called at 10am to find out who was working on the day. The receptionist said 4 girls and mentioned one of them was filipino.
So I arrive at 11am and 2 girls are at the reception desk. I ask if I could get a massage from the filipino girl. The main girl at reception looks at the girl next to her and says she is the filipino girl. I said she doesn't look like filipino, her looks/features were not even close! (I'm half filipino) and I asked again and they both tried to convince me that she was filipino.

I knew she was not filipino but by that time I just wanted a damn massage! She was an OK looking asian girl (standard Chinese features). So in to the room and it was noisy with the fan/aircon machine on. She decides to turn it off and during the massage kept asking me if I was hot, 15mins in to the massage she decides to turn it on again. Massage was very average she spent probably 80% of the time rubbing and chopping at my legs. I asked if she did any extras and she offered CBJ and HJ. I wish I never asked, it was the worse BJ i have ever had and the HJ was just as bad. She struggled to get me over the line. I had to pretty much close my eyes and imagine another girl (review coming soon) to get me over the line.

[COLOR=rgb(0, 0, 0)]I am very disappointed that I was lied to and was given someone I did not ask for. It ruined my whole experience. She knew nothing about the Philippines, didn't have the accent or the looks of a filipino (even if she says she was half). Again I'm half filipino myself and I know what they look like!

Never going back there again

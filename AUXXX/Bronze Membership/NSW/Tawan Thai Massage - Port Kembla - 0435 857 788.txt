My experience/comments : So went in there yesterday and had an oil massage with $30 HE. She was a fairly average looking lady, very friendly and chirpy. she took me to the room and asked me to undress. she had a pretty good pressure on my body, so massage was very god. As it was coming to end I was pretty hard and she notived it and asked me if i want any extra and offered me HE for $30. It was pretty good experience and will be going back there again.

 Recommendations for Thai Massage in North Sydney?
				
Post Content: 
Hi everyone, hope you're all having a good weekend. Could anyone recommend me some good Thai massage parlours in the Chatswood/North Sydney area? Im looking for something that offers a good b2b, but has decent atmosphere and doesn't look too run down. I've been to 84a Artarmon and read a few reviews on the thai massage place in Lindfield, but both of those venues are furnished more for blow and go type experiences. Kind of want something a bit more relaxing that looks and feels more like a Thai massage atmosphere-wise. I don't expect to be lying on silk, but if anyone knows of massage parlours that might fit the bill, could you please let me know? Many thanks!

Ended up going to Mali Mali as per Chalk010's recommendation. Wrote a review about it here: https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f351/...atswood-59502/ if you're interested. All in all a good experience. Apologies in advance for the fucking wall-of-text review lmao.

I've always found the Thai massage place in Lindfield great. Very clean, professional and good girls. 346 Pacific Hwy, above the pool shop as someone mentioned above. No FS but I've had DATY there before (not every girl though)

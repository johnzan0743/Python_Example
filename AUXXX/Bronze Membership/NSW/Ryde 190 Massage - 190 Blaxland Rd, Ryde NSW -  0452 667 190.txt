My experience/comments : 

I really like this place, its pretty discrete to enter from the back door and the mamasan is fast to reply on Line messaging with the roster. All the girls I have seen here are really good looking except for one or two I have seen in the hallway.

Sasha was great, I dont usually do 30 min sessions because I like a bit more of a massage to relax but she really dug those elbows in which was just what my shoulders needed. Definitely not well trained in massage but thats alright. 

For part two Sasha jumped on for a bit of a body slide and tickle tackle from underneath.
After turning over she started some simulated cowgirl before she asked if I wanted anything more which is usually a yes; I suggested a CBJ but at $100 it was a no go. she went down to $80 which is still too expensive but the little head was thinking...

The CBJ was awesome, with her in 69 its a great view, did I mention a great ass. I finished much too fast with that view in my face and a great technique in play but I got what I was after albeit at high speed.

Sasha does friday and monday

My experience/comments : 

I walk past this small massage shop everyday to get to work. They only have two massage tables and it's only covered by thick curtains from the outside world! I thought I'd give it a go since I see this young, attractive looking asian girl every Wednesday/Thursday, the other lady is a mature asian.

Her name is Sandi and her massage was very good. She gave a firm massage and I could feel she was putting in the effort massaging every bit of my body, at one stage I was so relaxed that I almost forgot to ask if she provided any extras!

30mins in into the massage I could feel her hands move closer to my inner thighs and start to brush my balls. Part 2 of the massage - the turn over, she signals if I would like a HJ and so I agree. Her hands are so soft, she knows how to hold a dick! She slowly strokes and builds up the pressure, getting faster and faster. She then looks at me and smiles... then BOOM! I came so hard it almost got my chin! No one has ever made me cum that quick like she did. I will definitely be coming back to her when I need some R n T!

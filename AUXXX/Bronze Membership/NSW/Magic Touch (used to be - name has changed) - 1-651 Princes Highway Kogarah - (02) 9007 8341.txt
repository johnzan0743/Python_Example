My experience/comments : 

Looking for a quick punt today, I have always noticed a hidden massage shop just behind the Speedway servo in Princes Highway.  The place used to be called "Magic Touch" but has recently renamed itself which I unfortunately did not remember. All I remembered that it was a Thai phrase. 

Ringing the doorbell, I was greeted by Tina and she immediately asked how long I would stay. Pricing is quite interesting as it is happy ending inclusive. $60 for 30 minutes, $90 for 45 minutes, and $120 for 1 hour.  Asked her whether more extras are offered and she went $50 for FS. I opted for 30 minutes + FS and was ushered to the massage room. 

The place itself is quite small but clean. Pop music was blaring through which is a bit unusual for a massage place and the massage table is basically just a bed. Started off with back massage which was just alright as she applied pressure from bottom to top. She did offer me whether the message was to be soft, medium, or hard. 

Flipping over, she quickly undressed and I got to play with her ample sized bosoms and her neatly trimmed pussy.  Lubed up and dommed, she proceeded with a fairly toothy BJ (now I know what a toothy BJ means   ). She then jumped on me and rode me to the finish line.  After cleaning up with wipes and hot towel, she gave me a bit more of leg massage as there was time left. 

Overall an okay experience  She works in the shop from Friday - Sunday.

My experience/comments : 

Haven't punted for a while, I decided to give have a quick RnT today. 

Rung the bell at the front door, I was greeted by the petite Natty. Opting for Â½ hour, I was given an HE inclusive rate of $70. Taking a quick glance, the place hasn't changed by much. The place is still clean and adequate. They are still using normal bed and pillow instead of massage table. 

Starting off with the back massage, it was alright. On the flip side, I get to have a closer look at Natty. She is a cute girl with braces on her teeth.  Her best features are those perky tits and ass. Without further ado, the tug began as I copped a feel on those beautiful bosoms and ass.  

It wasn't too long until I came and she cleaned me up real good. I was then offered a shower but I declined. 

She works every Friday and Sunday. No other extra service was offered when I asked her.

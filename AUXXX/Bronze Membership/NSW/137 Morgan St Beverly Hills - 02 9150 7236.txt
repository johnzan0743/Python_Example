My experience/comments :

This is my usual massage place so was excited to see Candy, had seen her in the establishment but never had a turn. Dressed in sexy red lingerie and big fakes were very obvious. Came into the room and said $70, I said "it's normally $55" and she said oh ok. Started massaging my back and then flipped me over. I tried to touch her and she said no extra 20. Kept trying to sell me on a BJ for an extra $30 but I wasn't keen and because of it clearly wasn't even pretending to enjoy herself. Came and gave me some tissues to clean my self up.

Was honestly really looking forward to seeing her, but was all downhill from when she tried to over charge from the start and then kept pestering for more money. I've had some great massages here over the years but I won't be going back to see Candy.

My experience/comments : 1 hour session. Room was small which turned out great. This ensured constant touching whilst she navigated around the room. Was provided GFE. She slid my hands between her legs during the massage which was a surprise.The room itself is clean. My only complain about the experience was the loud music that the reception had playing in the back ground which could be heard quite clear in my room. There is no shower facility. The massage was really good which went for approximately 40 minutes. Then, the time came when she undressed. She gave me some hand sanitizers which i applied to my hands. I assumed at the time that cleaning my hands was a sign that I could start touching her down there.  Once we were all cleaned, she climbed on the massage table and caressed my ear with her tongue. I then slid my hands down her Vag and all i could hear was her moaning for more. I couldnt hold any longer and exploded all over her hands. The 2nd half of this session was one of the better ones I have had in a while. Once I finished my business, she cleaned me up with a big smile. I got dressed and Gina gave me a hug and kiss. There is no FS offered. Only Massage + B2B rub with HJ.

Overall, she was a nice girl with good english. I would definately recommend.

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

I may not get the girl's name correct, but there's one thing about her that's dead giveaway: she has a bit of wall-eye. This started as a normal 30 minute massage-with-extras session, nothing great about the massage itself, she was clearly not trained masseuse at all. After about 15-20 minutes of awkward rubbing, she switched over to light strokes and asked if I wanted some extras, to which I said OK. She took her clothes off and started caressing my cock, which was kind of OK, BUT! In the middle of the session she decided that somehow it would be a terrific idea to spit on my dick, to which I was "WTF are you doing?! It's not safe, you moron lady!" Anyways, next morning I got my dick all red and itchy - rushed to a GP, got tested, diagnosed with yeast (aka candida / balanitis / fungal), spent next few weeks rubbing ointment in three times a day until it finally got back to normal.
Not sure where else this lady works, but if you see a little Asian with a wall-eye and weird look at her face that I can describe as "angry", even when she's smiling, just RUN. 

I've been going to various massage establishments in CBD, Ryde, Parramatta and Alexandria, and this was the only time this happened - all other girls were being very safe and careful.

My experience:
Wish I could remember when I went but they had the option for two girls for the price of 1. Rocked up and found it a bit awkward getting in as the entrance is on the main road. 
Went in and was met by destiny who took me on the room and apologised for the ac not working. It wasn't hot so enjoyed it anyways.
she also gave me a $50 voucher for next time.
put the VR set on and the picture was on the side a bit but they adjusted it. One sat on my leg nude and the other massages me but after 10 mins I asked to remove the headset as I found it hotter to have 2 nude babes, even if they were older . 
They kept running their hands up and down and I had to keep asking them to slow down. They didn't say if there were boundaries but my fingers did not penetrate anywhere. I did feel them up and down and they didn't stop me.
Destiny then asked me if I wanted to come on her tits which I did. After that, it wound down with a nice massage which Natasha is quite good at I must say. 
Overall awesome and would be back if I could enter without being seen.

Did they offer you a choice of videos?

Was it the video quality that led you back to reality? VR can be headache inducing if the focus is off or the video/sound/motion aren't synchronised very well. 

 I realise it's probably not meant to rival a true 3D theatre experience, but I'm interested in knowing how well they've got the tech right (Yeah, I may be a bit of a nerd!)

JSG why don't you pay them a visit and experience the VR in R for yourself?

I mean I think that the level of technical answers to the question put by you are only going to be answered truly by a visit in person.

SR.

Actually the video was quite good. Didn't have a choice of videos when I went but I would have cum within minutes. What I can tell you is that the video doesn't not match the physical experience.  Both  are good but not synchronised. What's happ on the video vs what the ladies are doing. So I opted for the ladies directly.

You're probably right sleazyrider. I should.  I'll keep an eye out for a promo or something, $150/30 min is a little steep for a R&T of middling quality.

Interesting difference.  I've got to say  like the idea of the synchronisation, might as well make the most of the novelty.

The problem is they keep advertising Destiny only and whilst she's good, I think the Russian was way better. That said If the entrance wasn't on the main road, i would be a regular there. 
The synchronisation issue could have been because I went in their first month of operation but the quality of the video is really good. Tempted to buy a similar set up at home if it was cheaper

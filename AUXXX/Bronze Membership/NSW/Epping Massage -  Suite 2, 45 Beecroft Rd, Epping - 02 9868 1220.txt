My experience/comments :

So this was my first time at this place, definitely a punt as I had only heard a little bit about the shop and nothing about the girls. There was only one girl working on a saturday so I am guessing they are a bit quiet.

 She asked upfront outright if I wanted any extras as the massage by itself was too cheap, interesting tactic but each to their own, I went with an hour massage and a HJ.

The room was fine, one of about 3-4 rooms, clean and neat with a clothes rack, air conditioning and floor to ceiling drywall to the next room.

The experience was not ideal, the massage was pretty lackluster with no energy even after I asked for it a bit harder. 

With about 20 mins left she stripped off and gave a light bit of body to body which was ok. On the flip she jumped on to the bed and went to work quite mechanically (trying to upsell as she went :P). 
After I was done she cleaned me up and sent me on my way a bit early. Nothing to seriously complain about, It just didn't have anything outstanding which is easy to get elsewhere. 

The kicker was walking out and up the street I saw the next massage place which is the one I think I meant to go to (of the same name, beside the beschico chicken place). Oh well, next time.

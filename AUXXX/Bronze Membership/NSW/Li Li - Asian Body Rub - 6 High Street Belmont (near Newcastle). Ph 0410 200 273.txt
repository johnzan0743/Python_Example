My experience/comments : I was just finished some hard work and felt like I needed to relaxation. Wasn't after sex but thought a nice rub and tug might be the go. Looked up Newcastle classified and came across a new place only a short drive. I rang first and the lady I spoke to (Li Li) seemed so welcoming that I thought why not.  I arrived and there was only Li Li there and she was drop dead gorgeous... I couldn't believe my luck!.  She got me to undress and lay on the massage table tummy down. She asked how long etc and I said 1/2 hour...  then I prompted for extras, she signalled a gesture like wanking and I said yes, she said $20 extra. no worries I said.  She started by deep tissue massage on my back and then she climbed on top and put her knees into the job... wow... then she got off and started more slow and sensitive touches. She asked me if i would prefer she was naked...  extra $30, I said ok and she bared a really gorgeous body and she felt so smooth. She didn't seem to mind me playing with her pussy or her breasts. She even kissed me (no tongue). After a while, she got me to turn over and she went straight for the dick and started stroking me. She was pretty damned skilled at stroking using a nice oil. After a few minutes of her breasts in my face whilst she was stroking, i blew my load. She cleaned me up and told me to relax and she continued with massage to the rest of my body including fingers even right to the last second of the 30 minutes we agreed on.  I was stoked with the service. Highly recommended.

I'd been meaning to follow up on this first review which looked a bit dodgy but Belmont is a fair hike from my joint, so I only managed to get down there recently. I drove all the way there at about 7:30pm one night only to find that they are NOT open until 9, they close at 7.  Drove home annoyed.

Went back a few days later and met Angela, mid 30s at least, not too bad but not really anything special.  Decided to go for it and see how it was, if only to confirm or refute the original review.

Got a reasonable massage, not bad but not spectacular, which ended up with a fairly decent but rushed HJ.  I kept asking her to slow down, not sure if she didn't understand or just wanted to finish me off quick, but she just kept jerking furiously until I busted.

All in all really "meh" experience, it wasn't great.  It wasn't terrible either though.  I'll probably give it one more shot to try and get the sort of time the other two reviewers have, but if it fails to impress again I won't be back.

Lol...didnt think of calling first to check what time they close? 

Have to agree though, the first review is definitely dodgy because the said closing time is different. 

Hang on...Its not the first time you have accused this member of posting dodgy reviews and even calling him a liar is it?

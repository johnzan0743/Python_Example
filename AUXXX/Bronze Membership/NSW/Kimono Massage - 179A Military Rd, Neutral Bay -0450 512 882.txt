My experience/comments : Messages the owner and asked who was on. She messaged be back Sarah and Jinny and showed me some pictures. When i got there Sarah had left but Jinny was walking out of the reception area and she looked pretty good. Tall Thai girl, she looked a bit chinese. The reception Jenny is very cute! I was tempted to ask if she provided massages, but didnt want to be rude.

Jinny took me into a very nice massage room, it was clean and well furnished like a proper massage parlour. Stripped down and was given a nice hard massage. Jinny told me she works as at a proper Thai massage parlour in the city (no extra's). After part one she asked if i wanted extra, $50 for HJ and $70 for body slide and HJ. It was a but expensive, but she looked pretty cute in her kimono. She got her gear off and showed me some nice C cup tits and a firm ass. Part 2 was ok, she started getting tired after 3 or 4 minutes. Overall the experience was a 6 out of 10. Part 1 was definately better.

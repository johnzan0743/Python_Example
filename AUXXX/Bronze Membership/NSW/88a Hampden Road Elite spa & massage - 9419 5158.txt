[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments : was passing this venue a lot of times and [/COLOR][COLOR=#333333]didn't know if I should risk it (I normally go by the forum recommendations). So I felt adventurous and decided to check it out. Well that was a big fuck up...[/COLOR]
[COLOR=#333333]Honestly I am not the type of guy who goes out of his way to defame an establishments name, but I could see that they really did not give a flying fuck. Hands down the worst service I've received. I have only been punting for 2 years now so I haven't been face to face with the pits of hell in the adult service world, but I believe I did get a glimpse of it I will dare to say. I walk up the stairs to be greeted by a big bear. She was the gate-keeper to hell. I mean the massage owner... man she was scary. I ask who is available and she says that it's her. Long pause. I look at her and ask if there's anyone else? She reluctantly brings over the other girl. Forgot her name sorry, but it's better that way I didn't remember her name for her sake and mine. She was sitting down on the couch playing on her iphone. Maybe she didn't hear us I thought. The owner barks at her and she looks up, says hi. THE MOST EMOTIONLESS I DONT GIVE A FLYING FUCK HI. 

My head was hurting already, but I'm so weak at saying no...how do you guys do it??? Maybe it's the lack of experience and haggling. I get escorted into my room; dim lighting. small space, mirror on the wall that can't see shit. Most establishments place mirrors on the wall so that I can see the girl do her thing. Nope, I just see the roof. I ask for the prices; $50 30 min $70 45 min. I was thinking... man those prices are really strange... It's too little to be a massage and HE, and it's too much to be just massage. Wrong. It was just a massage. I was already half undressed (I'm really fast at taking my shit off) so I was like... fuck it. Asked her for the 30 minute as I had really bad feelings for the massage session. Start off the massage with the standard towel on your back and loosening out your muscles. Then came the oil. *Splash, and before I knew it my whole fucking back was drenched in oil. Well there goes my shirt. At this point there was so much oil on my back I couldn't feel her massaging me. All I could he was the swooshing of the oil rubbing against my back. After 15 minutes of her polishing my back. She asks if I wanted anything extra. I asked her what she has on offer. And then she replies "I don't know".....

BITCH ARE YOU KIDDING ME??????????
I don't know if she was playing hard to get or what but after she said that I was so ticked off. From the outside I politely said no, but in the inside I was going crazy! I'm sorry for not going through with the extras to tell you guys more about it but that was pretty much the last straw.
$50 for just a 30 minute massage? Go see a professional.

Sorry, this was more of a long rant than a composed review, but the service was just the worst.
Moral of the story, trust in the gentlemen of ausxxx.[/COLOR]

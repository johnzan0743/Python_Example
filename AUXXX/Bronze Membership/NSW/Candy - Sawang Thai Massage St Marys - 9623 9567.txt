My experience/comments:

Candy was my 2nd experience in recieving a massage and happy ending, and what i experienced was value for money but not necessarily something I would recommend.
I have had only 2 massages proir to visiting Candy at Sawang St Marys and although the massage was 'ok' and value for money (as if was cheaper than previous massage parlours) I would recommend previous parlours over Sawang.

The girl i was given 'Candy' could barley speak English and was mainly communicating through sign language.
She was probably in her late 20s early 30s, short (possibly 5'6ish) but had a good body. Smallish B cup size tits and a tight round ass.
She began with a massage which was quite soft and when i tried to communicate with her to go harder she didnt understand :s.
Finished me off with a happy ending which was fine and allowed me to touch her everywhere as long as i didnt put my fingers "inside"
Overall like i said previously yes it was cheap and value for money but for the extra $15-$20 you would pay elsewhere it would be worth it in my opinion.


Cheers
Nick

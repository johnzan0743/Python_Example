My experience/comments : 
Walked in and was greeted by receptionist, at first look I would have preferred her for the massage, but another lady popped around the corner, and I was directed to her.
Arranged time, and payment, got ready on the table and normal massage started, a but of chit chat, later it seemed that she was mostly interested to be sure that I wasn't from anywhere near her home.
Massage proceeded, and wasn't too bad, seemed happy to let me touch legs etc while the massage was going. At the end of the "massage" there was no tickle tackle/etc, just asked to turn over, and then she asked if I wanted any extras. We negotiated a HJ, but she was clearly hoping to do more, unfortunately, I didn't have much time (hence the 30min booking only), and I figured I would come back another time for more fun. She was pretty much straight to business, but with a little guidance, she was happy to play with other areas, as well as having no problem with my hands wandering under her clothes. I didn't push it, so outside underwear only.
I wasn't sure I'd get there, but she was keen to help, and with the right verbal and physical encouragement, we all got the happy ending. A swift cleanup and time was up.

As I mentioned, I'd probably go back again, maybe for an hour next time, and I'm pretty sure she would be happy to go a lot further. I don't think it was the same ML (didn't ask last time I was here) but I have had FS here before.
Works Thursday and Saturdays at the moment.

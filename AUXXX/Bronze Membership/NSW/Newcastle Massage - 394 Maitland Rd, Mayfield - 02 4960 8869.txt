I think he means "discreet" - definition :- careful to avoid social embarrassment or distress. He is probably looking for a back entrance that he can exit without being seen. Sometimes we all may be looking for something similar, or then ... maybe a back entrance that we can enter ....you be the judge.

Unfortunately there is no rear entrance, however as the place is in amongst a small group of other shops, offices there is not a great deal of foot traffic in the area, which makes it a little but easier to slip in and out. Most people would think it was just a massage joint and nothing else. I did try another place just down the road a couple of weeks ago , will do a review as soon as I can. This place does have a rear entry but it is a bit of a rabbit warren getting into. Thus front entry to this place is in a much busier business area.

I was here at 394 a few days ago for the first time. It's a quiet group of shops - no major pedestrian thoroughfare... just stroll up and in the door which is set back a bit from the footpath. Too easy.

Very discreet... "descreate" even... 

But I would like to desecrate a rear entry if available... hehehe!

I'm looking forward to your review of 'another place just down the road'. Is that the one on the corner of Victoria and Maitland road?

My experience/comments : I walked in and the place was clean and tidy. There was only one girl available, she was very cute and said her name was Jessica in broken english. I went through to the room and paid. I stripped off and when she came back she gave me a wondering full massage, nice and firm.
She asked me to roll over and I enquired about extras, $30 for a hand job. I handed over the cash and she oiled up my old fella and gave it a sensual rub, good hand job, not rushed until completion.
I will be heading back, definately value for money for a basic R&T.

I've been to this place quite a few times and usually get a pretty good service. They were a bit dingy in the past but business must be good as they've had a renovation and it's quite nice now.

On this occasion I met 'Bonnie' from China IIRC (maybe Taiwan..). She would have been mid 30s, 5/10 on looks but good enough. I was mostly interested in the massage on this day so that didn't matter too much.

I was led into the new room and told to undress as usual... nice and clean, wooden floors... there's a shower in there so maybe there's some extra extras going on? Anyways I strip down and assume the position, Bonnie comes back a few minutes later and asks if I want a hard or soft massage. I tell her hard as I'm knackered from work, so she says she's going to get a machine. "Uh oh" I think, picturing the physiotherapist style of thing where they put you on the TENS unit and wander off for half an hour while billing you $100/hr! She comes back with this hand held massage machine thing and gets cracking, it was great! Good hard massage and got right in there.. she tells me she uses the machine because she's not so strong and can't give hard massages, as well as her hands get sore when she does. After a couple of minutes of the machine I couldn't care less, it was just what I needed.

She ran the machine for about 10 or 15 minutes, then starts a lighter hand massage with oil. Reasonably firm but not super strong, but perfect after the little machine session. Lovely massage, lots of oil, good combination of firm and sensual. She finished up and started to run her hands over my back lightly, working her way down to my ass and balls and getting me nice and hard.. flips me over and asks if I want HJ, I say yes, she says "Extra $20." Sweet as. HJ was great, she asked if I want "fast fast or slow slow" lol, I tell her slow as we had about 15-20 minutes still left. She gives me a cracking HJ, perfect speed, got me close to coming then backed off a bit, etc etc... probably a good 5-10min HJ all up. I came HARD.

Once she'd cleaned me up she massaged the front of my legs as we'd been talking about how my legs were sore from being on my feet... then finished the hour up and off I went.

All in all great service, 1hr massage w/ HJ for $100, I left a happy chappy. 

On the way out I asked when she works - she said mostly Mon-Wed but sometimes Fri/Sat as well.


Safe punting!

Tina is kind of shy but she gives a good relaxing massage. Not the best if you want to undo a few knots and get a deeper massage but still much better than some places. She does start on the "fun" bit a little fast but she'll slow down if you ask her to and doesn't mind being touched all over. All up it's good value for a happy massage.

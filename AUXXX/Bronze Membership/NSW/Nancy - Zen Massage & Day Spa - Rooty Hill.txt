Armed with my $50 courtesy of 7 Crappy St, I decided to throw caution to the wind and try my local in Rooty Hill.

Old reviews elsewhere suggested a hint of fun but ages ranged from 40+.. quick text and was assured they had young girls (haven't we all heard that before)

Arriving I was pleasantly surprised to be introduced to Nancy.  Great english, friendly with great massage technique I was in heaven..

On the flip, usual question and 7 crappy st $50 put to good use.  Nancy has a fun style and great gfe tease and whilst her undies stayed on, as soon as I rubbed between her legs, the undies came off..

Kicking myself as I have found a gem 5 minutes from home.

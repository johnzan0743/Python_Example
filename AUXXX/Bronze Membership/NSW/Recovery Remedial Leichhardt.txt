just went in. had a tight back, so was hoping to kill 2 birds....

Never been to this sort of massage place before, Usually its not an open secret what they do, its just a fact. Walked in and ushered into a massage room. First thing i see is "we do not provide sexual services" on a sign (I wasnt too put off have heard about these signs before, and then the question always comes/cums). 

The lady asks if i want massage, I say yes, she asks how long? I say 30 mins, pay $35, and we begin... Full on, great massage very deep. As good as it was don't think i could do longer than 30 mins But the question never came..or did I!

Is there some sort of code you are supposed to use? or do you think they have changed their business model? Wasnt comfortable outright asking for it, and not too disappointed, as cute as she was, the actual massage was great and a steal for $30

I know this isnt in the review template, because I dont consider it a review, I am asking a question about the place

No it is definitely not a review. By the way, never post in the new member area now you are Bronze or it will be deleted.

 Nina at Bamboo Massage Sydney
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Nina (may have been Gina I didn't quite catch her name)

Establishment : Bamboo Massage

Date of Visit : 7 July 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Bamboo at Level 2 World Square CBD - Asian Massage Sydney 

Hours of Business : 10am -9pm 7 days

Rates : Massage 30 minutes $40, 45 minutes $50, 60 minutes $60 plus extras ($50 when I went)

Age : mid 20's

Size/shape : Size 6, slim B-C cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : Massage, nude happy ending including touching

Value for money/recommend? : For sure! I have only seen Nina though so can't vouch for other girls

My experience/comments : I hadn't been to Bamboo massage before so I called to make an appointment at short notice with anyone who was free. The entry to the parlour is quite private located in a suite inside of a larger building, when I went there were no other businesses open so I had to buzz to gain access. On arrival the girls were still busy so I had to wait for around 15 minutes which was not too bad, before getting being introduced to Nina (may have been Gina i didn't quite catch her name) who is a short very attractive lady with a slim/athletic build. I disrobed and hopped up on the massage table while Nina  was out of the room and when she came back she made some friendly small talk while the massage began. I had an hour massage so the first 40 minutes was quite a good relaxation massage (like a Swedish massage with oil) laying on my stomach then she started sliding her hands a little further under me with some nice teasing strokes around my man parts. She then asked if I would like a front massage to, I said yes, the price was $50 and would be nude and include touching she said. I said of yes and she slowly disrobed and began rubbing me all over. She let me touch her very nice breasts before climbing up on the table with her pussy and ass around my shoulder area and her breast over my tackle. She let me rub the outside of her v while she stroked me off two-handed with oil. it was a great hand job and after it was over we still had about 10minutes and she offered a second hand-job but sadly i was too satisfied. Instead she gave me a chest head arms massage until our time was up. Would definelty reccomend massage was a 7/10 and extras a 10/10.

Person's Name : JoJo

Establishment : Bamboo Massage

Date of Visit : 22/07/2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Bamboo Massage, 0404 154 538, World Square  Suite 27 Level 2, 650 George Street Sydney 2000 NSW

Hours of Business : 10:00 a.m.  8:30 p.m. 7 Days

Rates : $60/hour (+$20-$30 for HJ or $50 for nude HJ with touching)

Age : mid to late 20

Size/shape : Short, Curvy (but well propotioned), C+ boobs

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage, HJ, DATY, R&T

Value for money/recommend? : 100% YES

My experience/comments : 

This is my first experience in any 'adult' service in Australia. I have been addicted ever since then with trying new places(with over 12 place in under 2 month I think I need an intervention )

Being the first, I've done way too much research for the best first time experience. I decided to go to bamboo massage in world square because of a few things:
- It is located inside the building on level 2. This makes it ideal as it is hidden away from the public street (More discrete).
- With the price of $60 an hour, not only that its cheap, if extra is not offered, I can just go with the flow for normal massage.
- Well reviewed and all of them have mentioned that extra is normally offered.

Anyway onto the main course:
When I arrive there (@2 pm on a Wednesday), the place was dead quiet. Jojo greeted me at the counter as she both handle the money and administer the massage.
She was wearing an air stewardess costume which is a great start.
I opted for an hour massage (started with 45 minute and change it halfway through the massage).
Part 1 was fairly standard (mostly because I was nervous) regardless it was a legit massage although as I stripped down to my boxer, she ask straight away if I want to take them off (great start) 
I asked halfway through the massage if they do anything extra, JoJo run her finger through my ass and describe the available 'menu' $20-@30(I forgot) for HJ and $50 for naked HJ with touching.

Part 2 was great considering it was my first time. She took everything off and my hand was free to explore every inch of her she has a nice brown skin. She even rub some oil on my hand and place them onto her pussy, only limit she has is no digital penetration (which is pretty fair).
I then asked her to go on top of the table so that I can have a closer look at her pussy, and she even let me do some DATY. I started with a very gentle lick (very inexperience with this kind of service) but she actually start to burry her ass on my face which encourage me to go harder. It seems that every time I get rougher, she reciprocate by squeezing and stroking my cock harder while she moan the word fuck every now and then. I came while sucking the hell on her delicious pussy. The best part is that she keep on stroking for a good minute afterward to make sure that all the cum has been released. Needless to say I was amazingly satisfied. Shower was offered but I opt in for a hot towel instead.

Additional note: I have been there a few time to try the other talent there. As far as I know it really depend on the lady that you get (YMMV). Some girl does not allow any touching below the waistline and some allow you to be more adventurous some of the lesson that I learn from multiple visit to different r&t joint is to always clarify EVERYTHING when negotiating for extras (where to touch and what's the limit).

Nice review firefox0303. 

The best reviews are those with the most detail. 

The more detail and info we have on a lady/establishment the better we are equipped to decide if we want to book this person. 

This is the whole point of writing a review-helping our members to decide if the provider is right for them.

Things such as the cleanliness of the venue, parking problems, if the lady is punctual with her bookings, were you allocated the full amount of time you paid for, cleanliness of showers,towels and linen etc. 

All little things but helpful for us in making a decision whether to book or not.

Nonetheless, great first up reviews and keep them coming.

nextlife

Person's Name : Nancy

Establishment : Bamboo Massage, upstairs 651 George St

Date of Visit : 28-4-2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 651 George Street, Sydney 02 9280 4455 
Hours of Business : unsure

Rates : $60 hour + $50

Age : early 20's

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage + Nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : okay

My experience/comments : 

I always try and fit a massage in when in Sydney. Much better value for money than Melbourne. I'd been to this place once before and also to it's other shop over in the World Square shopping centre. Had a good experience here about a year ago so decided to try again.

Nancy was young, very early 20's I expect, and very pretty. I like the young innocent ones so was very pleased when she came into the room. Her massage was pretty good and not as lacklustre as you often get from the young student types. When it came the flip she confirmed I was happy to pay the $50 for the nude handy. I offered to undress her but she didn't want ay help and kinda nervously stripped off at the end of the table. Although she tried hard to please she was also very careful not to allow any intimacy. I tried to get her to lie next to me but that was a no too. I was allowed to file her small but soft titties but kitty was kept well out of range. She did was to make sure I got a good release though and was up for some coaching in that regard.

Once the deed was done she was very friendly and chatty. I suspect has a boyfriend and wants to keep restrictions on what she does to the bare minimum. or she's new to the caper and very nervous. For a girl so pretty she needn't be.

This was a few months back and I had never been to an r’n’t parlour before then, so I wasn’t quite sure how everything would play out.

Somehow an ad for Bamboo Massage caught my attention and I decided to try it out. The entrance to the shop on 651 George Street is rather in the open, so I felt a little awkward walking in. However, as I walked up the stairs I saw a hot young Thai girl and forgot all about it 

She quickly showed me to a small room on the left and asked how long I wanted to stay. I chose 30 mins and paid the $40. Jenny (I asked for her name later) asked me to get undressed and lay down on the bed. After a moment she came back and asked if I would like a gentle massage or a stronger one. I opted for the gentle massage and she even asked me if it was ok to use oil.

Her massage technique was very sensual and I loved the feeling of her soft legs brushing against my feet, legs, and arms. After the massage, Jenny asked me to flip over and offered extra’s. Her English wasn’t too good and I had a hard time understanding what the options are (my first time too), so in the end I opted just for the HJ. Looking back I should have taken the naked HJ as she must have had a very tasty body.

Jenny started massaging my penis and balls with both hands. Her technique was amazing. She didn’t rush it and her hands worked wonders. Watching her in action was a pleasure in itself. It didn’t take too long for me to cum and she slowly squeezed every last drop out.

After cleaning up I tried chatting a bit but almost all I understood was that her name was Jenny and she was from Thailand. Perhaps it was also because she spoke really quietly.

I paid $20 for the HJ (the naked HJ would have been $50), got dressed and walked out on the street with a perhaps too obvious grin on my face

This was my second time at Bamboo Massage at 651 George Street.

I walked up the staircase without an appointment and a pretty Chinese girl greeted me before quickly taking me to a room on the far right of the corridor. She goes by the name Annabelle and is quite tall for a Chinese girl, with a model type look. Quite attractive, big boobs and nicely shaped legs.

Annabelle started off with a good massage ($40 for 30 min). After about 15 minutes she asked me to flip. When she offered extras, she played out like she's not quite sure how much to charge and asked for $30 extra for just the HJ with a question like tone. I told her I paid $20 before and she nodded with a smile before proceeding to the HJ. It was a bit of a turn-off that she was trying to inflate the price during the session, but I wasn't going to let it spoil the fun 

She was quite ok with me touching her butt and nice big breasts, and just asked in advance to not put fingers inside her.

Annabelle was intense in her sexual over-acting during the handjob, which was a bit too much, but I have to admit that she did have a skilled pair of hands. She's also the type of girl that will give many compliments which some may like.

Overall it was a decent massage and HJ, and I left pleased. I just prefer the girls with a little less acting during the session but it wasn't a big issue.

Age : 30 something

Size/shape : Medium build

Services Provided : RnT, NHJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Cindy took me to one of the rooms, which was small but not too cramped.

She asked if I wanted hard, medium or soft massage. I asked for hard. And it was. She started with some back stepping. This stared out alright but I wimped out after a while and asked her to stop. Then she used her elbows. It was firm but not too firm. I had a lot of tension in the upper back shoulder area and it was just what I was looking for.

Overall, it was a good massage. It was strong enough to feel like it was having some effect but not so strong as to be painful. As I said, she will do soft massage as well if that's what you want.

The part 2 was the usual sort of thing. There was nude B2B and HJ. Cindy was enthusiastic and happy and so it was not bad.

The massage was what impressed me about the session.

Rates : $60/HR + $50 NHJ

Age : Mid-Late Twenties

Size/shape : Toned, slim, enhanced d-cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage & NHJ

Value for money/recommend? : YES

My experience/comments : 

Sorry, this is a catch up review. I took the opportunity during this time when my ex-gf was overseas to go out punting. Friday night and was drunk with a few friends and decided to come up to this venue. You have to walk up a flight of stairs and the mamasan greets you. Was led into the room and in came a Thai hottie, Dada. Dada was hot...this girl does her gym work. Hope her massage matched the first inspections.

Laid down and she worked on with her Thai massage technique - a lot of elbows which really helped to loosen the knots. She enjoys a good chat and we talked about her time here. As the massage wound down, she applies the hot towel and commences some soft fondling of my nether regions. She whispers to my ear to turn over and I flipped revealing a very tall pitched tent. Offers the usual ($20 HJ or $50 NHJ). With a rack like that...NHJ please. She strips to reveal just that - perfect enhanced d-cups and a sexy toned body. Slowly she commences the hj and works the shaft. I didn't last long staring at the tanned toned body and rack like that and blew all over my belly. 

Dada works only Fridays here, and as my ex was away for one more week, I decided to make a reservation for next week. More to come...

My experience/comments : 

Part two! Came back and booked Dada who greeted me with a hug. This girl is amazing - makes me want to take a trip to Thailand myself. Decided to go for one hour as per last time and commenced a hard massage which eased the muscle pains in the back. Skip to the part you all want to know. Again the offer came...and this time I counter-offered...$90 bodyslide was what I got. Deal! Off came the bra and panties and those melons gliding down my back was just a feeling to behold. 

Flipped over and felt her tanned rack sliding up and down my shaft. She then puts a little oil down below and commences a soft tug. It was amazing...and although I wish more was on offer, this was really a great way to satisfy my urges.

    My experience/comments : 

Popped into this joint after having walked past in several hundred times after work. Pretty stock standard shop and experience. What you expect from the many asian rub and tug joints in the CBD. Prices are generally the same and service is aswell. 

Emmy was okay looking but l was toey so l went ahead with it. D grade massage which lead to a flip, some haggling before she stripped and tugged me off. 

Again nothing to write home about and pretty vanilla.

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

I'm looking for a good masseuse who is also sexy fun, as I have a bad back, and today it was really sore. 

The good part is there is parking and an entrance out the back. When she opened the door, I was  taken aback by how  feminine she looked with her hair down. She thought I was nervous and her English wasn't the best. "Do you want a shower?"

"No, I've already had one."

"Shower is there," she pointed as she gave me a towel. So I had a shower.

The room was nice, warm and spacious. I went for the 30 minute option to test her out. The place was empty, so I didn't feel rushed. She undressed and gave me a good massage. No talking. I'm not a fan of Thai massages. They're all arms and soft pushing, not direct enough. When she found a tight muscle, she worked it, then gave up. She gave me body to body, gave the odd tackle tickle, but she wasn't hard, and I was still sore, so there wasn't much action from my side. 

When it came time to roll over, I wasn't aroused. She worked me gently, then faster, but I had to ask her to slow down. Nothing wrong wither her technique, I was still too sore to be turned on, she looked a bit more masculine with her hair up, the lack of communication didn't help and I had to use imagination to get a hard on and blow. I think she offers extras, but neither of us were interested. It was back into the tiny shower  with pump action soap  and I was soon away. 

Bena only works Tuesdays and Saturdays at Miracle.

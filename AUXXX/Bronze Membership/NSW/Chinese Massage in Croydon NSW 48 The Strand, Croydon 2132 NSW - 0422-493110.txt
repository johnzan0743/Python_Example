 Chinese Massage in Croydon NSW 48 The Strand, Croydon 2132 NSW - 0422-493110
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Cherry or sherry

Establishment : Chinese Massage in Croydon 

Date of Visit : 14th Dec 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 48 The Strand, Croydon 2132 NSW - 0422-493110

Hours of Business : 10am to late depending on how busy they are 

Rates : $35/30 - $60/60 

Age : late 20's maybe 30 (hard to tell) 

Size/shape : Slim with A cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : ML Chinese

Services Provided : Nude Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : 7/10

My experience/comments : Thought i would give this place a go because its close to home. I think you guys realise now that i live in the Croydon area and its within walking distance so its pretty convenient. I usually go to PJ Massage which is another 10 min walk from this place but as I always say "a change is like a holiday"

The entrance of this place is pretty public , basically at the end of the main St which is called The Strand.Not real good if you are shy.
From the outside , it looks pretty legit and its also a few doors down from the Chinese take-away shop.

The door was locked so i rang the door bell, a slim and quite pleasant looking lady opened the door and introduced herself as Cherry or could even be Sherry (her acsent was pretty heavy)
She led me into one of the cubicles which was nice and clean. By the way there are 3 private cubicles as far as i could see and there is also an upstairs ?? maybe she lives there.
I didnt have a choice of girls because I didnt see anyone else so i didnt ask. I paid her $35 for 30 min (new place so better see what it is like first before going the hour), stripped off and laid on the table. A few moments later and Cherry/Sherry came back into the room and started the massage . Cherry/Sherry is quite talkative and friendly.

In all honesty, her massage was quite good, hard and firm and really got some of the knots out of my back . If compared to Patty from PJ massage, then i would have to say Patty's massage is harder, none the less , still pretty good.

After about 15 mins she asked me to turn around and then asked me in a very soft voice whether i wanted a special massage. I asked her how much which she replied nude + HJ for $50.
All agreed, so she stripped down revealing a slim smooth body, with small boobs, I'm no expert but i think they were A cups .... all in all , quite a nice little package.
Started with a bit of body to body and then HJ which she has a pretty good technique. While this was going on, my hands were wandering North and South which she didn't seem to mind. 
She got me over the line, cleaned me up and asked whether i would like to take a Shower. I declined as I would rather go home and shower . Cant gauge the cleanliness of some of these places .

In summary , it was pretty good and i would go back again but i still prefer Thai girls because Thai girls seem to be a lot more feminine and sexy than Chinese girls.
The only negative point about of this place is that the entrance is a bit public and the traffic can get pretty busy in the afternoons

Hi there Chowunfat,

If you are concern about the front entrance being too exposed , there is actually a back entrance via the lane way, you just call the shop when they are there and the girls will let you in.

Cheers

Person's Name : Lilly

Establishment : Chinese Massage in Croydon 

Date of Visit : 9th March 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 48 The Strand Croydon NSW  - 0422-493110

Hours of Business : 10am to Late 

Rates : $35/30min - $60/60min

Age : Really Hard to tell but probably late 30's

Size/shape : Petite with B/C cups 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RNT plus

Value for money/recommend? : OK

My experience/comments : Its been tough financially lately but i was in need of a good massage and a bit of jiggy jiggy. Managed to scrape up a spare $100.00 so rang this place to see who was working. The lady on the phone said Cherry and Lilly was working so i booked Cherry again based on the good service she had provided the first time. This time as per LUNGORS advise , I requested to enter the rear entrance via the laneway. 
By the time i got there a lady was waiting for me to let me in, you have to request to enter via the rear entrance rather than just roll up there because they have a few ducks in the backyard which could do a runner if you leave the gate open for too long.
The lady's name was Lilly and she escorted me in straight in to the room. I told her that i had booked Cherry which she replied Cherry was in Queensland on holiday and would be back in another day.
Don't you hate it when they do this to you ..... anyway, i felt like walking based on the principle of being misled but what the hell, i was already inside so i thought may as well give Lilly a try.
Lilly is petite in size and older than Cherry. Cherry is prettier than Lilly as well as being slimmer.
I undressed , hopped on the table and the massage began. The massage was OK , not hard or soft and i probably would think Lilly is not as skilled as Cherry. 
Everytime I go for a RNT, i only carry $100.00 note ..... I only stay for 45 min which cost $50.00 so that means i get $50.00 change which 9/10 times the girl will always try to get the $50.00 change out of you by offering extras.
After about 30 min of massaging Lilly asked me to turn around . A bit of a massage on the front and a bit of convenient brushing of JNR made me stand to attention. As soon as Lilly saw i was at attention she then asked me whether i wanted extras. I asked her what kind of extras which she said nude body slide with HJ..... i agreed on the price for $50 as that's all i had anyway.
Lilly stripped off to reveal a reasonably tidy package , I am no expert but she looked like she had B/C cups , probably more leaning towards C. 
Lilly started to work her magic and my hands went to work at the same time ..... there were no parts off limit to my hands as long as i was gentle. BTW, Lilly has a really hairy bush which in todays day and age is not that appealing , nether the less , as long as it was clean and no bad odours coming from there then i could accept it.
Bit of oil on JNR and then she brought me to completion . All in all Lilly wasn't too bad but in no way is she as sexy as Cherry . Cherry is more talkative and playful whereas Lilly is business.
I'm going to give this establishment a rest for a while and go back to Patty's ..... as i mentioned before , I find Thai girls more sexy and classy ..... I suppose all girls working in this industry are of course money hungry but the point is how obvious they make it .....

Without wanting to seem like a constant defender of this place, I believe that Chery didn't leave for her holiday until later on the same day you went and it may have been her intention to work. In my experience she never misleads customers but there could have been a miscommunication with one of her girls. In relation to Lily, she she is certainly older and less pretty than Cherry. However, over numerous visits, I have found Lily to offer an excellent and passionate GFE. I now try to rotate my visits between Cherry and Lily in keep to keep in both their good books. I have only been to Patty's once and didn't see her but I find the overall experience at Chery's place far superior. But in all these things, attractiveness and value is in the eye of the beholder. I love Cherry's place for its proper rooms and shower as well as the quality of the staff. It is pretty much my default option apart from occasional forays into other local shops.

Haha, if Cherry has bigger tits, like a natural C Cups , poor Lily probably won't even get a look in by yours truly.

But I suppose we would see different MLs for different things and our needs could vary from time to time.

For me, if I need a firm massage: Cherry!

If I only have a $20 for tips and I want a long and sensual HJ which I can just lay back and enjoy that for 30 min without needing to touch anyone or anything, that's Cherry tooooooo !

For everything else at Croydon, I will see Lily - and that's just me...................lol (may be only because Lily once told me I was the most handsome customer she ever has, just wondering how many most handsome customers she actually has.............haha)

Each to his own and YMMV that's for sure.

Person's Name : Lilly

Establishment : Chinese Massage in Croydon

Date of Visit : 13th April 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 48 The Strand Croydon NSW - 0422-493110

Hours of Business : 10am to Late 

Rates : $35/30 - $60/60 min

Age : Late 30's

Size/shape : Petite with B/C Cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RNT Plus 

Value for money/recommend? : Yes and No 

My experience/comments : Contrary to Massageboy's last post, Cherry remains elusive. I called and enquired to see who was working today and the person on the phone said Cherry, Lilly and Lisa . Told her i would be there in 15 mins and wanted to see Cherry.  The lady said, OK no problem and see you in 15 min.
Got there and a young Chinese girl opened the front door for me and once i was inside, i had told her i had rang 15 min ago and that I booked to see Cherry.
The young girl replied, Oh! I am sorry but Cherry is out and I don't know when she will be back . This had annoyed me because it happened to me before and i should have walked but i was in desperate need of a massage and I was already in the shop so i asked her who else is available . 
She told me that only her and Lilly were working so  her name must have been Lisa. Lisa looked very young and very plain looking , she was dressed in very conservative clothes and didn't do anything for me so i asked if Lilly was available. Lisa called out to Lilly in Chinese and the answer was that Lilly would be 5 minute.
Lilly comes down from upstairs and took me into the back room downstairs, 
The massage was same as i had described in my previous post .... nice and hard and then time to flip over.
Agreed to pay the extra for nude body to body and HJ ($50) ..... as you know, i had seen Lilly before so, again Lilly was giving the same/same good service but this time Lilly was talking non-stop and kept asking me personal questions ..... am I married, do i have any children , where do i live , do i live by myself , do i own or do i rent ..... WTF ????
in hindsight, I made a big mistake in the beginning of the conversation and told her that i was divorced and had 2 kids thinking that would shut her up but it didnt, ....she kept asking more and more questions....
Lilly was playing with Jnr and my hands were all over her but I couldnt concentrate and enjoy the moment because of all of her questions and talking . I finally had a very unsatisfying ending and just wanted to clean up , get dressed and get the hell out of there. Whilst i was getting dressed, Lilly asked me to go to my Doctors and get a check up and bring her the certificate and show her next time i see her , I asked her politely what for ? She said so next time we can have BB/FS and we can have a baby etc etc etc ....
Shit ! she scared the hell out of me !!!.... all i could do was say Ok, .... i went into turbo mode , hurried up and got dressed and said see you next week . I was walking out the door and Lilly kept asking me not to forget to go to the Doctors to get the certificate. 
Guess who wont be going back to this shop ??????  .....

Not sure why this is contrary to my last post. I do know that Cherry has been off work for at least 4 weeks and will be off for another week as far as I am aware. I suggested a miscommunication last time and I suspect this is the problem again. Frustrating I know. I don't know if you are speaking Chinese to these women but apart from Cherry, the English level of Lily, and most of the other MLs, is weak. I am getting a bit tired of you questioning the accuracy of my posts. I think my record speaks for itself.

Hey brother MB, I think Chowunfat could be a Chinese guy or ABC with an user name coming from a big Hong Kong movie star and if he looks half like a Chowunfat, I can totally understand why Lily wants to have his baby .......... lol

And with Lily's English level , it would be quite hard for her to communicate all those stuff he said that she have said , so I won't be surprised if they were even talking in Mandarins??

Anyway , each to his own , from his own words, he likes Thai girls anyway so don't know why he kept going back to a Chinese shop ??

@@@@@@@@@

From his last visit:

In summary , it was pretty good and i would go back again but i still prefer Thai girls because Thai girls seem to be a lot more feminine and sexy than Chinese girls.

My experience/comments : I have seen Bonnie about 5 times now and from a fairly rigid massage first up, has developed into a nice 'go to' massage when wanting a nice straight forward hard remedial massage with nice HJ to finish.  She is extremely short, I would guess 150cm tops but quite cute despite her advancing age lol..  Despite this she packs quite a punch with her typical Korean style remedial massage, which is pretty much worth the money in itself.  The first time I saw her, her HJ was very forced and I struggled to cum.  I thought she was going to end before I could finish, however this has become much more relaxed in ensuing visits and whilst not top of the grade, is still more than adequate.   Definitely recommend seeing her.  She from memory works about 3 or 4 days a week, but sometime these vary around.

I'm sure there is number of punters in the inner west area do remember Wendy from 191 Burwood and from other local massage joints.
These days Wendy is based at this joint, works at least 5 days a week although she can accommodate an adhoc appointment here on here day off if you book with here in advance.
Wendy will provide a more than good massage. These days Wendy more often will work on my lower back, buttocks and upper thighs, how I like it. However, she will work on your shoulders, neck and arms as part of her normal routine.
Once Wendy focusses on the areas my abdomen, groin and upper thighs is when you acknowledge she is worth the money you pay. The best part is when I am on my back and Wendy mover her hand around my groin area and purposely brushes my dick and then a nice massaging of my ball sac and again all around the groin until she gets the el cheap baby oil and stats working on my stiff. 
With one hand slowly lubricating the head of my penis and the other hand rubbing my ball sac. After a good 5mins of the same Wendy then slowly goes on with a majestic tug while the other hand still caressing my balls.
Wendy will mix it up with a quick tugging spurt then slowing down to ensure my climax build up is ready to implode and then eruption takes place with ultimate pleasure.
Wendy will also provide detailed clean up with warm wet towels that you will appreciate.
Just further two points here, Wendy is no stunner but then again I have had punts with less than attractive ML/WL's. but she does offer a A1 massage/tug session. I don't touch her touch her during the tugging, I just close my eyes and enjoy the moment coming my way. 
Secondly, if you are a first timer with Wendy, it might take more than one or two visits before Wendy opens up in providing a tug session. Wendy is of a shy nature, if you do rush with the obvious question on your first visit, she might not comply.  

I usual, I slip in $20 for the extra service, however, I gave a little extra since it was the Festive season.
Wendy's days off is usual Tuesday/Wednesday or Sundays.

Hey, nice job all round Wendy/TBM,

Yes. I too can vouch for Wendy as over time she has become one of my favourites. Her style with me is different as described by TBM but the end result is just as vibrant.

My usual trysts with W are @ 191 Burwood Rd on Thursdays and I'm due a game away in Campsie.

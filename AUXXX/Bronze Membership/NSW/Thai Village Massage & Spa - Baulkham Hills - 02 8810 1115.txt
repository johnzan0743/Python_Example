Recommended -  yes. For a legit massage. 

A new Thai massage place opened up close to home so decided to give it a go.
Nicely appointed shop. Was greeted by the first ML Mid 30s and quite pretty. And was asked to wait.
A few minutes later a younger but plainer girl came out and asked me how long. 30 Mn I said. She then took me to the room. Just take off top she said. No RnT then. Not that I was really expecting one. Only shoulders and back for 30min she said.
Once on the table I asked for the hard option and told her the areas to concentrate on.
She asked me a question I didn't understand but said yes. Turned out to be, is it ok to use some sort of "Tiger Balm" instead of oil. 100% no RnT then 
 It was ok, giving a bit of warmth, but would have prefered oil.
The massage was pretty good. On par with most legit Thai massage joints.
Will probably go back again to if i need some knotts straightened out.

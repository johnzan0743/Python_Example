I understand there is a thread dedicated to this shop but i thought i would share my good experience (despite quirks) with Annie today.

I had a day off from work and had the itch that needed a scratch - i recall HUGH reviewing a thai stunner in this shop so i thought i would give it a go. I live in the area and thought id check if Annie was working, she answered the phone and told me she was the only person working today....I call back in an hours time to book and she now says there are 2 girls.

Anyway, I walk into the shop at 2pm and im found waiting at the reception desk, i think the 2 ML's were having a nap. All good, into the room I go with Annie (the room is hidden around the side, however secured only by a curtain.

Annie appears in the room and asks "are u sure you want me to massage you?" - a confusing question, well seeing though she is a legit 8/10 and the other ML was a milf porkshop I was sure. The usual "have you been here befores?" were exchanged (ive been told i look like a cop - fit, burely 6ft 2 european) as the massage begun.

Part 1 was actually very good, she warned me that she may hurt me and to tell her to go softer if it began to hurt. As she wrapped up part 1, i started to rub her thighs and ass during the massage, she didnt move...great sign. She asked if i wanted to turn over and sold me the standard $20 for just a hj, didnt really push the nude option till i asked.

I help her undress as her hands are oily and exposed are some NICE bolt on tits, a small frame and meaty ass- very pleased. She starts oiling up junior as i sit on the edge of the bed sucking her tits. She shows no signs of fake enjoyment but i was getting genuine moans... i feel downstairs and her pussy is wet!! I stroke it up and down and start to stick my finger in....she told me not to but was happy for me to keep rubbing.

I asked for any extras and she responded b2b will be $60...i agreed coz i was toeyer than a roman sandle and requested spanish for the last 5 minutes. Spanish was done lying down and then i got her to sit in her chair, where i stood up and blew my load all over her tits (she wasnt too pleased but i dontknow how she didnt see it cumming).

During the part 2 a punter walked in and was asking the other ML a lot of questions....prompting Annie to do the tlaking as the other ML did not speak english....she did this as she continued to stroke my cock and apologised about the sitch- i found it hot...my ML telling apunter she will be 10 mins as she stroked my cock....this punter was a FEMALE looking for genuine massage :P

Venue: 6/10 ...nice enough, very little privacy in the rooms...not a prob for me, but might be for some.
Girl: 9/10....sexy, allowed spanish...yum
service 8/10: part 1 awesome, part 2 good, i feel there is a chance to build report with this one 

She only works Mondays

Geez you guys are anal with your review guidelines - I dont agree with how you merge all shop reviews under one thread. It should be based on shop and girl.

I have been an AUS99 member for years under a different alias and thought I would start contributing here....maybe ill pull up.

Can't agree more. I raged against the restrictions for quite a while but now appreciate the simplicity of getting all the information I need about a shop from one review. Like most of us I get lazy sometimes but the review template is definitely the key to this site's value. Just look at the shit that passes for reviews on some other sites.

Ill leave on my own if I wanted to champion. Since we follow everything to a "t" here, why did you delete my post where I tried to help you guys. JKQUEEN massage is now "Sussex Star" massage - either create a new thread for the shop name (which I tried to do), or rename the JKQUEEN thread.

I have approx 50 reviews I can unload that I have dropped over the last 2 years if they are wanted/appreciated?

Im a 3 time a week punter so would love to keep you guys in the loop if cool? If not, yeah no worries - ban me.

Thanks for the pick up mate - I wanted to copy and paste my review from another forum but realized it didn't fit the template used here, so I rushed it this arvo.

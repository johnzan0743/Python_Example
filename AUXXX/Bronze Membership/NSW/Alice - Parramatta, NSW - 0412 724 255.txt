My experience/comments :

Okay, we'll, this is only my second punt...so I suspect I had beginners luck with my first. I'm sure many of you reading this will be thinking beginners mistake with each comment I make! :-) 

After messaging "Alice" I received a reply from a different number, I asked about availability and also asked for a selfie - the photos in the add were clearly not real. I received a selfie that looked pretty good.

On arriving I was asked to wait 10 mins before coming inside. When I entered the unit a short, BBW woman greeted me. Hmm. Not the selfie person and definitely not what I wanted. I thought I'd go through with the fun anyway. 

I really don't know how to describe the rest of this experience other than very disappointing and a good guide to what I will not do next time. Alice was not sensual, not very interested, kept checking her phone when it pinged (and even sent a few voice messages), wiped me with cleaning wipes before touching me and asked for extra money for something advertised as included. I was so err, built up, I just let it go and left. 

What do others do when the person who greets them is nothing like advertised nor what they like? Am I the only idiot that just goes through with it? :-)

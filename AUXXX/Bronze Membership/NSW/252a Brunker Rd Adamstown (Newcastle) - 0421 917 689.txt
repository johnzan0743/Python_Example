My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Texted through and arranged for a 30 min Body to Body. I was greeted by Patt and Chi. Patt was the girl pictured but she looked not quite as nice as the pics because she was in track pants and not in glamour gear  Chi had a fuller figure and might have had bigger boobs. So I was asked by Patt who I wanted and I went for Chi. I got naked and lay on my tummy and waited for Chi to enter. Chi asked if it was ok that she was a ladyboy. A little surprised but I said yeah no worries as I always been a little curious especially from my earlier memories of Thai dancers

So anyway, the massage started and I gotta say Chi was pretty good at the massage.. quite relaxing. A little while passed and she still hadn't undressed so I asked her to do so and she dropped the top and left the bra on. I asked for more and she popped out quite a nice set of boobs. I was wondering where the boby to body was asked her for it and she complied. When I flipped over she went for the shaft and I was not quite excited but I gave it a go and eventually after playing with boobs managed to get excited. I wasn't allowed to play with her tackle (she said becasue she is Thai so I guess small?) so I didn't feel it was as advertised. But then Im not sure if I would have liked it anyway.

All in all, even though the ladies (and ladyboy) were friendly and welcoming, I think I'd try the lady next and just do the $60 rub and tug or just give it a miss. If you really want the ladyboy thing it might be for you or there might be better out there?

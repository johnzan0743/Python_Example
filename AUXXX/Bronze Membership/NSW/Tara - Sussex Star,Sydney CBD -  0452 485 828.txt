My experience/comments : Tara is very young and fresh with nice tits.  She is not super slim.  Her massage is not good but I did not spend much time doing that and instead talked to her about herself, her sex life and such.  I prefer talking to the young ones since their massage skills are usually poor.  Tara was quite frank with me about her life and it turned me on to hear how she enjoys masturbating herself from time to time.  I asked her if she recalls particular sexual experiences when touching herself but she quickly corrected me, letting me know that she uses softcore Korean porn that she finds on Youtube.  This gave me a kick to hear and its not the first time I heard young Chinese girls mention using softcore porn when they diddle themselves.  Anyway I will probably go back to see Tara because I enjoyed touching her very youthful body and also I was glad that she humoured an older guy who wanted to hear the details of her sex life.

My experience/comments : First time visiting this place, it was around 8pm. Did not make a booking and was not shown any line up. 
But luckily the masseur was good.

Part 1, the massage was firm and relaxing. There was no chit-chatting which I did not mind. 
She told me afterwards that it was half Thai half remedial massage, and I felt it was quite good. 

Part 2, it was a bit ordinary for me compared to other shops. She has fair skin and great hand skills. But there was not too much teasing. 

Overall, the experience was OK for the money but will definitely book next time. 

Cheers.

Please everyone, always ask and remember the name of the provider so that the review is more meaningful. Services between different providers can vary dramatically and are operator specific.

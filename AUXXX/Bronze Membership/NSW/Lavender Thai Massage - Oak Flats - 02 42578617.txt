My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)
I was feeling a little backed up and thought this place would be a sure thing. I've done Dapto Thai before and it was good but always fun to take a punt somewhere new. I just did a walk in during the middle of the day and there were no customers and I could hear staff chatting out the back. She came down said $70 for the hour, I said OK. Went into the first room and had an average massage. She was no looker, a bit old but not fat, still had that Thai slim body. Upon the flip she covered my cock with towel but massaged righ tup the inner leg. Then she moved to last leg and said "you want extra? $30". I said yes please 

HJ was pretty good, lots of brushes early as she swept her hands from my legs across my cock, then she started doing twisting of her hands on my cock and then grabbed hold and pumped me till I blew a thick white load all over her hands. She held me just below the knob and squeezed out every last drop, ahhh felt good. Clean up and left. Was a bit odd tho that she left the door ajar the entire time so if someone walked in off the street they could easy see what was going on. All in all pretty standard punt, wouldnt go back but it was fun.

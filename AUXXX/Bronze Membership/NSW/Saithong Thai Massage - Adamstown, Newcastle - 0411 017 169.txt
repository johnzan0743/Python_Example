 Saithong Thai Massage - Adamstown, Newcastle - 0411 017 169
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Methinee / Mary (goes by both I think) 

Establishment : Saithong Thai Massage 

Date of Visit : first visit about a month ago, second visit today. I didn't review the first trip as it was OK but I wanted to give them another chance before writing a shit review

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 227 Brunker Rd Adamstown / 0411 017 169 / search the name for FB page with pics

Hours of Business : 10am - 7pm supposedly 

Rates : I think the first one was about 120 for 60min including extras

Age : REAL hard to say. Face says 40 but ass says 19. I would say late 30s early 40s but wouldn't be surprised if I was wrong. If she is as old as I think she might be, she is VERY VERY pretty for her age. 

Size/shape : about 5'4", probably size 4-6, fucking spectacular set of bolt ons.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : massage, tackle tickle, very nice wristy

Value for money/recommend? Still on the fence. Explained below. 

** FIRST EXPERIENCE **
I found a review on PP saying this place occasionally does FS and even if you don't get that she's super hot + her standard service is great so decided to give it a shot.  Wandered in there about a month ago and was greeted by the owner, a very very attractive petite Thai lady called Methinee. She's the one in  all the photos on the Facebook page. 

Into the room, ask for an hour session, cash changes hands (80 I think it was) and on the bed I go. She leaves the room while I get ready and is shouting to the other girl and a guy that was there. I lay there for five minutes or so while she makes some phone calls and orders some stuff for the Thai restaurant she later tells me she also owns, lol. While I'm laying there another guy comes in for a rub and I hear him ask for 45min (important info). 

She comes back eventually and starts what turns out to be a very nice massage with lots of rubbing in my happy spots, she manages to nail it... I love when a masseuse rubs around my side just above my hips (no idea why) and in that crease where my leg joins my arse... She's all over those and I'm raging already. 

Problem is though while this is going on she is talking in Thai to the other masseuse and shouting instructions to the dude out the back who's then making phone calls and placing orders for spring roll wrappers and satay sauce and whatnot, it was really fucking irritating. 

She eventually sends the dude off to make a pickup (all by shouting while massaging my nuts) and it's roughly time for the tug part of the rub and tug so over I flip. She then starts telling me that the dude is her boyfriend, boyfriend number 500 or some shit haha. All with my cock in her oily hand. 

This is where it gets good tho, she strips to reveal possibly the best rack I have EVER seen. No exaggeration, she has a super tight body with these ridiculously well done bolt on, they are fucking unbelievable.. Gravity-defying shit right here. She lets me do pretty much anything I want to them while she gives me a cracking wristy and I end up just about leaving a couple of strings on the ceiling. 

I left with a grin BUT the dude who wanted 45min is still there...  I check my watch and look and behold I'd only been there 40min. Hmmm the service was tops so I thought I'd give her another chance and I was stinging for a bodyslide with those cranking bewbs or maybe even score the FS I hear she gives out occasionally. 

* SECOND EXPERIENCE *
Decide to go for another crack... I usually just let things flow and see what happens but I decide I'm gonna flat out ask for an oiled body slide cause I'm stinging for a bit of Spanish from that insane rack. 

Rocked up at 5pm yesterday arvo, sign on the door says 10am - 7pm but sign says closed. Ring a couple of times, no answer. Text, no response. Have a couple of beers at the pub across the road and go home. 

Call her this morning and book a 1.5hr  massage for 530pm. Rock up at 525 to see a closed sign on the door... ring the doorbell, no answer. Duck over to the pub for a beer and text her to let her know I'm here.... An hour and three schooners later, no answer. Head home pissed off. 


Overall I don't really know. She is insanely hot (I love petite Asian girls with good bolt ons) but her lazy attitude is annoying me. If the service was better this chick could be 11/10 but she just seems hopeless.

Unfortunately my experiences so far have been less than satisfactory but I feel like if you got her at a time when she wasn't busy and you scored the FS she apparently provides on occasion then it would be an amazing punt. I love a great massage but unfortunately the best FS girls tend to give rubbish massage so to find a chick this hot who can give a cracking massage then fuck the arse of me would be unreal. 

Real shame, she had so much promise..

Got a text at ~7:45pm: "so sorry, had to help a friend with their car, forgot phone in shop, sorry sorry."  Whatever, I wasted two afternoons, and excuses don't get my time back.  I might give her one more crack to see if she can really come through like I think she could but it'll be the last chance.

In the meantime I went to a new-ish place up the road and had a CRACKING session, review coming

Thanks for the review Goaty, I've been here several times as well and it's been a great hit to start with then a bit more of a miss the last couple of times I've been. 
I've always hoped to get Methinee but always ended up with someone else. 

Ive found what you get in the service now isn't as much as I got when I first went 12 months ago. I wouldnt be surprised if they have tamed down the "service".. Maybe??

After my last visit, I'm not sure I will go back.

Couldn't tell you, I only found the place recently.  The FS reviews I found were all from a while back so yeah, not sure what's going on.  I may give it one last crack as long as I can get her and not someone else, Sat/Sun arvos seem to be the time for that cause there was nobody else in the store both times I went.

Hi guys,
Finally someone has reviewed Saithong.
I can agree 100% that Mathinee is hot.
First visit got Methanee straight up. 10am raining Wednesday.
First time visit lots of chit chat and personal questions flying between us. $60 for 1/2 hr massage me nude , her in tights and tight  t shirt. Good HJ really slow and drawn out. She never got naked.
Second visit a week later I booked her .
Welcomed by her at door. Shown to room and exchanged money for 1/2hr $60. Asked to do extras at end of massage and she said we will see. She walks out and then She comes back with another girl. She says that the new girl will massage for 25 min then she will be back. Big smile.
I get 5/10 massage. At 25 minutes Methanee comes back and offers FS for $50.
I whip out the money and she leaves and returns with her kit.
Strips and doms me up way too fast.
Her body is sensational.
She rides me like a pro and she seems to enjoy it but is silent due to the thin walls I guess.
After I cum she cleans up and insta-dresses herself.
No BJ or DATY discussed or attempted.
My third visit was exactly the same.
That was all in Oct/Nov 2015.
Haven't been back since due to funds.
Will return for old times sake soon.
She is too hot to not go through with it when ever I feel the need.
DTR

Well if members waited on your contributions they would have to wait a long time. By the way you belated comments here are NOT complying reviews.

Why haven't you post your full compliant template reviews when you have visited? 

Please note free membership reviews maintenance requirements. https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f39/m...ivileges-8318/
You have only posted two complying reviews since joining. I suggest you get cracking.

Hi again,
I wasn't posting a review but simply a comment/run down on my experience.
I deliberately didn't do reviews back in 2015 as this place is a massage set up.
I didn't want to be the first to mention any thing other than massage as this can blow the lid on a place real fast.
Massage shops don't like to publicise any thing more in my experience and I have always supported them in this unless it's been mentioned in other circles before.
I could grind out a couple of reviews to up the quota I agree. It's definitely on my to-do list as time and privacy to do an extensive review are hard to get in my current situation.
I'm sure you can see my respect I have for this business and the people who earn their living from it.
Cheers 
DTR

Given that you do not want to comply with our rules you have been are not contributing and only two reviews since joining. As you have been so reluctant and leeching on other members' reviews you have been dropped to Registered User.

If you do not want to contribute but still want to read the reviews maybe you should consider paid membership.

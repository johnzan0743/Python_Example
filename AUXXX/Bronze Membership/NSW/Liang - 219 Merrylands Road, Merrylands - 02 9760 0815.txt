My experience/comments : 

Comrades,
Park in the main shopping centre at merrylands stocklands and exit on the train station side, walk down Pitt Street to merryands road, turn right and mooch along the right hand side of the road until you hit the doorway of 2/219, avoid the stares of the locals and sprint up the stairs (I always seem to get up those kind of stairs quicker than normal to escape the chances of my boss walking past only to recognise my trousers and shoes) and be greeted by a smiling chinese mum.
She's smiling because she knows exactly what you are there for because you are not a chinese lady there to get your barnicles ground down or your arthritis accupuntured. 
'Mother' will summons her mate who sadly has no name but she is the resident MILF, and she's not a bad sort for her years and occupation. She says nothing except to shout things in mandarin to the shop owner, I always think she's shouting "this blokes gotten fatter in the last year" or 'he shaves his balls, what a pervert" but it's probably more mum type conversation like "I need to get some more wool to make a scarf for my grandson"
Anyway, she will massage you mediumly or roughly depending on the level of punishment you require for going there then all of a sudden she changes to MRS CAT who purrs and runs her fingernails up the back of your thighs and bumcheeks which is her signal to have you agree to the $20 tug tax.
A $20 tug ensues which is good because she has no doubt done this 3000 times before to 30% of all the men in the local area.
She is a genuine MILF, I have seen her in Merrylands shopping centre doing her shopping and would love to go up to her and say she's a wonderful wanker but I don't think my wife would appreciate it.

Thanks for the review disasterous. I've walked past this place many times but it looked very unlikely to be a rnt so kept on walking. Clearly I was mistaken!

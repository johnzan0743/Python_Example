Yet another shop has opened up in Pennant Hills (bringing to a grand total of 4).

I was walking down the street today after lunch wondering which shop to visit when I saw this new one had appeared. Although the official address is Hillcrest Rd, it's actually in a parade of small businesses along the top end of Pennicook lane.  

I couldn't resist giving it a go and walked in. The mamasan was at the desk and hurried me in.  She told me her name was Jessica and she had opened the shop last Thursday.  It's obviously still a work in progress as there were some building materials inside, but it appeared mostly finished including the rooms.  She kept saying 'you lucky first customer' I'm not sure if she meant lucky for me or for her though.

She told me that she would ring for one of her girls in another shop and she could start the massage (this took a little while to understand because she talks a lot but her English is not that good).  I eventually figured out that she owns 2 other shops  one in Castle Hill and one in Thornleigh across from Aldi. 

So I went into the room  everywhere looked clean and new, the a/c was turned up quite high so it was a bit on the cool side.  Given that it was about 40C outside, that wasn't too much of a problem though.  I got undressed and Jessica came in to start  - I'd put her age at late 40s maybe even 50s.  Still she's an attractive MILF so I didn't mind.   Like I said she was quite talkative but I could only understand about 20% of what she was saying.  Eventually I understood that she wanted to have MLs in the shop that were more experienced and could give better massages, and that the younger girls were too fussy and caused to many problems.

She actually gave a very good massage over back thighs and butt, and I began to think that her HJ technique would be pretty good too.  
But before we got to the turnover, the girl she had called turned up.  

Her name was Mimi and she was working at the Thornleigh shop so didn't have far to come.  I'd say she was 30s and a bit chubby but in a nice way.  
She took over and Jessica left the room - shame I thought I might get a 'double special' as I was the "lucky first customer"!

Mimi pretty much started on the feathery touches over thighs and butt then asked me to turn over.  The standard question HJ with clothes off for $50.  She had a natural figure - small A cups and a bit of a tum - which I am completely OK with.  She starts a bit of a titty rub on my dick while kissing my chest, then dips down to start licking my balls and perineum, then slowly up my shaft.  She did ask if I wanted a BJ, but since I only had 50 on me, I told her just to go with the HJ. What followed was 5-10 minutes of good unhurried HJ action.

Well Pennant Hills seems to be turning into a mini Chatswood with all the shops and services available now  who'd of thought it in the neighbourhood of avid church goers (no disrespect to those who go to church as long as they don't try to spoil my fun, live and let live I say).

I'll do my best from memory...  I'd say she would be late 40's, but could be a bit older.  Slim, but because she was wearing loose fitting clothing I couldn't say what shape exactly.  My guess is that she was probably fairly small in the boob department because I didn't feel a whole lot when her chest was pressing into me when she was at the head of the table during the massage.  Face wise, she was attractive - she may have had a nose job at some point, because it was quite narrow and straight (more of a Caucasian 'high' nose).  Her hair was up, not short, and parted to one side.  She was friendly and laughed quite a bit and talked quite fast - only problem is that her pronunciation was not so good so it was pretty hard to understand her at times.  Can't really say much more than that, but I hope it helps

My experience/comments : 

Came in on a Sunday and was led into the room by Yuki. This place is rather new and appears to be same owner as shop in Thornleigh and Castle Hill. In general the shops here offer a decent massage and extras are restricted to happy endings. The story is rather the same with Yuki who gave me a very strong and decent massage. Around the 45 minute mark, she wipes me down with a hot towel and flips me and offers NHJ for $50 which I agreed to. She does a decent job and brings me to completion. Tipped her off and off I went.

Was shown to a room by Jessica, the mama-san, and shortly afterwards in walked an attractive ML in a skimpy black dress. She was slim with shortish hair and I’d put her age at late 30s/early 40s.  But what struck me most was that she had quite a deep and husky voice.  It really took me by surprise, it was the sort of voice that I have not really heard on an Asian girl before.  Her English was not good but she told me she was from Hong Kong and also worked at Castle Hill (not sure of the shop) – and only Saturday at this shop.      

The massage started off well - she began without using oil, and worked to get the knots out. But due to the deep voice I couldn’t get a nagging doubt out of my mind that she might not be wholly a woman, and I found myself looking for other signs like how strong her grip was during the massage or how big her hands might be.  However, I did manage to relax into the massage and it progressed nicely with some oil.  Eventually she started to massage my perineum and then slipping her hands slightly under to cup and massage my balls.  Soon after I flipped over and thinking “in for a penny, in for a pound” decided to take the nude HJ that was offered. 

She stripped off and revealed a good body – slim with some tattoos on her back and side, not overdone though.  She had a pert little butt and what appeared to be pretty natural A cups, and no sign of any additional appendage down below, just a manicured bush.  So I was quite relieved in a way (no offence against ladyboys, but I much prefer a naturally formed female!)

She started a good HJ, slow and sensual.  She let me suck on her tits, which were definitely all natural.  She returned the favour – normally I’m not a big fan of having my nipples licked but it actually felt good – her tongue action was great and I’m sure she would do a fantastic blowjob if asked, as I think more would have been on offer. After cleaning up, we had a bit of chat, she put her arms around me and kissed me on the lips (but no tongues!) and I went on my way.

I may venture back, I’m always willing to give a second go to see what may develop, as long as the first outing isn’t a complete dud.

Person's Name : Sisi (pronounced SeeSee)
Establishment : Shop 3/2 Hillcrest Rd, Pennant Hills
Date of Visit : Thursday January 23rd
Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 3/2 Hillcrest Rd, Pennant Hills, Phone: 9980 2196
Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm
Rates : $40/30min $50/45min $60/hour plus tip for extras
Age : 30's
Size/shape : Chubby
Nationality or Ethnicity : MLC
Services Provided : Massage, NHJ
Value for money/recommend? : ok but nothing out of the ordinary

After entering the shop was greeted by Sisi/SeeSee who was wearing a red dress.  

The massage was ok - she didn’t use any oil to being with and used her elbows/arms to get the kinks out of my back, shoulders and butt.  After about 10 minutes she applied some oil and continued to massage the upper half, although she did spend a lot of time kneading my butt cheeks too, which was nice.  However, she didn’t get around to massaging my legs before going to get the wet towels for the wipe down. 

The usual feathery touching and TT started, followed by the turnover.  She stripped off to reveal quite a chubby body, which I don’t mind as long as it is distributed the right way.  I do like natural tits and a bit of an arse, so she ticked those boxes.  She then spent some time licking and sucking my balls which I really enjoyed, although at one point she sucked a bit hard and made me jump a bit! Then onto the finale with the oily HJ, which was unhurried and quite well executed.

I don’t have any complaints but I didn’t really have a connection with her, so for me it was a pretty standard massage + HJ and I would not rush back to see her.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Phone: 9980 2196
Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm
Rates : $40/30min $50/45min $60/hour plus tip for extras
Age : 20's
Size/shape : Slim but with curves + natural b-cups
Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Value for money/recommend? : ok but nothing out of the ordinary

Candy is a nice and friendly girl, with decent English although says ‘darling’ a bit too much.  

Part1 - decent enough massage, typical thai style with elbows and forearms.  Not really any TT.  As the start, she  asked me what area to concentrate on and I told her back of the thighs as they were a bit tight. She then spent 70%  of the time massaging my back! 

Part2 – good tugging skills and a tidy body and nice little handful of bubble butt which I enjoyed playing with as she got me over the line.   She works here on Friday and Thursday at the sister shop in Thornleigh (Shop 2 - 2/293 Pennant Hills Rd, Thornleigh).

All in all ok, but I wouldn't hurry back to see her.

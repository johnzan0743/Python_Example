My experience/comments : Found this place by accident - whilst working in Liverpool on way to Council. Decided to take a chance and see - worst case a 30m $35 massage
First impressions - clean, nice aroma, Lucy meets me on entry - nice tight floral dress - takes my hand and leads me away. She is quite smiley and quite provocative.
In the room tissues, oil on the shelves, paid my $50 for 45 min (only 1 hour ticket parking nearby) 
Stripped and greeted Lucy with a full frontal and semi erect member, as she was quite forthcoming right up front when she asked for the massage payment, so I was quite hopeful.
I let her go through 10 mins of massage with me feeling her legs and rising up to her panties. Not much resistance - so popped here a proposal. Lets fuck. 
She jumped at the chance - popped out for  dom  and returned,  allowing me to undress her (always a nice moment for me). We misshed with here on the table, for a short time - then 
whilst she was still impaled, a picked her up - slid on the table on my back and got her to ride me. She did a bit of squatting so I could see and enjoy but she wasn't too strong in the legs and faded quickly. She continued to rock back and forward till I arrived. Very nice Lucy. I will be back

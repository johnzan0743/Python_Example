My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)
I was in town so gave her a call and no answer but a text response. I replied so went to the motel and knocked on the door. Busty 20 something opened the door and I thought "yeah baby" but she said go to room 31. I thought probably a few travelling together so sure why not. So I go to 31 knock on the door and door opens with her hiding behind the door. I go in and she is not the looker the first one was but body wasnt bad. Negoiated $80 for 30min massage and HJ. 

Financials done both strip off and i lay face up on the bed. She had A cup boobs with massive long nipples which I played with. I could see shaven pussy but couldnt reach it. She have me a decent HJ and I quickly shot a load. She did the clean and said roll over. Then followed a dry strectching massage which was reasonable. Then she rubbed tits over my ass and started dry humping me. I could feel the stubble on her pussy. She kissed my spine then rolled off and started tackle tickle then said roll over. She grabbed my cock and i had a half mongrel by that stage and said "cum again". Hell yeah so she gave me a bloody good handy and seemed as happy i was when i cum all over her hands again. Cleaned up, cuddle goodbye and out the door.

Thanks Rubbedup, I travel through Albury regularly. Next time I do, I'll check to see if she's still there. It's always nice to get a shot away when travelling.

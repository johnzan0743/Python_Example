My experience/comments : 

Booked myself the deal on Groupon for this new massage place near Hunter Street in the city. Arrived and it is an extremely small place with two small massage rooms. Can't remember the ladies name but she was quite short and chubby but had some nice boobs that were being revealed by her low cut top. 

Told her I didn't want any oil on my undies and she asked if it was alright to take them off to which I agreed. Little bit of tackle play while on my stomach and turned over fully erect. She proceeded with the masssage and there was no mention of any extras. I started to rub myself a little and she proceeded to point at my pubic hair, pulled her pants down to reveal her shaved pussy and said much better without hair, we both laughed. She asked me if I wanted help and would be $20. I agreed and she finished me off. She mentioned a few times not to tell anyone as 

Was a very good massage and happy ending in a small place off the street. Recommend however you can get a much nicer room elsewhere.

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Carrying some very weary muscles with me I rocked up to the rear entrance of 84A with no booking. I walked in and there was a stunning Thai girl sitting behind the desk and another plumpishgirl behind. Oh well I thought. It wild be nice to get the receptionist but what can you do. She showed the room behind the desk which was only covered by a curtain and slightly larger than a shoe box. I handed over the money for an hour and she said she'll be back soon. Bingo! It looks like I was getting the receptionist after all. 

She came back and what ensued was a reasonable massage for the next half hour or so until she lent down and asked if I wanted more. $50 for nude. I could hardly say no. I got up and was able to help her out of her tight dress and release the most perfect set of firm b cups I've seen for a long time.

After a period of play I moved to lick her amazing breasts but she stopped me and said another $20 for that. A bit stiff I thought but she had a captive audience and saying no was simply impossible. Five minutes of breast play and she grabbed my hand and placed it on her smooth pussy which got us both even more worked up. Soon after we finished in a mess of panting and goo.

Fantastic session and despite the hefty tip would certainly go back.

Thinking about it you are right. I had no idea they were different shops. That's a mistake for amateurs. 

I'm very sorry but it looks like I put the post in the wrong thread.

No worries FR. I think many have been confused by the two shops.

My experience/comments : 
The ad looked ok, but I should have left when I saw the room. Bare room, tiled floor. One chair, table. $35 for half (that means I gave her $50 and she left the room) and get ready.
Not a lot of English, and no smile.
Lay face down and suffered 15 minutes of dry prodding, pinching and slapping. Turned over - I think that's what she asked me to do. Little guy was hiding from the punishment. Agreed on $20 for hj. No way I was paying the $50 for clothes off. Eventually got over the line then a quick wipe up with tissues. All over.
I've been to a lot of chinese places, but this was terrible.

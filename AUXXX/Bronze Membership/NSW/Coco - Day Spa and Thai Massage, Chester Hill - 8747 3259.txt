[COLOR=#333333]Saving my money, but end of the year I said fuck it. I'll book a massage, I'm kinda over True Thai and then so I googled Bankstown Thai massage and found this place, upon arrival looks like those Thai shops...walked in, had a girl called Nutt, she's older but decent...I wasn't expecting much, she told me to "take off all your clothes", so I did. 

Massage begins...she's really good..had me in a trance..there was not much tickle tackle..only just before turn over she got one finger and shoved it between my two balls. I turned over raging hard..I dunno what she did but effect was instant..she then asked $40 for hand job, I said no $30 and I wouldn't budge...so she started...and her technique was good, she would go really fast then slow...then stop and then massage my balls and then ensure I completely empty my load.

I'd go again, though it's a bit expensive total was $95 for massage with HE...considering True Thai is cheaper about $20 cheaper.

I'd go again but maybe in about 6 weeks or so. There is another shop in Greenacre, I won't go there cause my cousin works in a shop across the road.

My experience/comments : 
Gave Coco Day Spa a call, they were open so I drove up to take a look.
A nice modern establishment, the massage rooms are behind a second door which separates the waiting area from the massage area so there is no street noise.
Rooms have floor to ceiling walls but I am fairly sure my room only had a curtain for a door . it did have a hand basin, large massage table and was cleaning and well air-conditioned.

The lady (I am sure Luci isn't her real name as she answered to something else in Thai) was very nice, pretty and friendly ... a nice figure and quite bottom heavy.
The massage itself was excellent ... I was thinking this was going to be a very legitimate and professional service, so I just lay there and enjoyed it.

On the turn, Luci averted her eyes and held up the towel ... but the towel seems to be raised quite high when she was massaging my legs ... nice.
The next thing I knew my stomach and legs were being massaged and the towel was pushed up over my chest and the effect on junior was very obvious to both of us :-)

Lucy didn't offer anything extra and I was unsure what would happen to I asked whether there was more on offer .... she shyly smiled and offered HE for $35, which I accepted.
To be honest, her technique was pretty poor and not that pleasant but her shy smile was enough to get me over the line.

A nice girl and a nice establishment, I don't expect all of the girls offer the same extras, but who knows.
A shower is available for an extra $10 (I think this is free if you choose the body scrub option .. starting at $50 or $55 for 30 minutes).

I doubt I will return as, even though the place is nice and clean and modern, the price isn't competitive and the extra $$ for a shower is a bummer.

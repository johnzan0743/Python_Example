My experience/comments :
Have been a regular here for years mostly because of how good their massages are and if the need arises, there is always a willing ML for FS. The mamasan is familiar with me and usually takes on the massage and then sends in one of the other MLs if FS is requested. This has been a good arrangement but I've always wondered how mamasan would go in the sack. She has delivered some great HEs via her silky hands before but has always passed on the FS option and while we are comfortable with each other, we do have a bit of light banter at turnover time where she will try to sell me a handy when i ask if FS is on the menu. Usually she swaps out with another ML but last week was very very different. 


I was in Blacktown after a long break and decided to drop in and see Tina (mamasan - the names here i notice are interchangeable - sometimes she is Tina on the phone and other times she is not but I always walk in and see here or wait for her so just go with the flow). She greeted me warmly and says she hadn't seen me in a while. I explained my current travel heavy situation and she was understanding. She asked if i wanted my special (her massage and FS with other ML - Mimi) and I said yes, booking for the hour. 


Paid up front, stripped and settled down in the back room. Massage began and Tina was at her best getting into the knots and loosening up my wretched back. Around 15 mins in the door bell rang and Mimi said something to her Chinese from the front door. Apparently Tina had an appointment. She apologized and said Mimi will take over. I was a little disappointed but given i had arrived unannounced, understood and went with it. Mimi, late 40s but looks young and tall, came in and picked up where Tina left off. The firm massage was very relaxing and i was soon drifting off. It must have been 30 mins or so when Tina came by the curtain and said something to Mimi and left. Mimi finished the massage and said she will get hot towels. 


Hot towels arrived but it was Tina instead of Mimi. I didn't realise this until after the feathery fingers treatment and tackle tickle had finished and i turned over with my member erect to see Tina giving me a cheeky smile. I was thinking its been a little while since i enjoyed her manipulations but instead of getting the oil, the saucy milf started stripping. Now I was confused, this is not her usual move but who am i to argue? I sat up woth my legs on the side of the table and she ran her hands over my balls and shaft. I kissed her a-cups and sucked on her small nipples while tracing my hands all along her skin, eventually reaching her trimmed pussy. I gently teased her mound and lips and found her moist. Her hands were massaging my shaft now and she leaned in bit my earlobe and whispered "you fuck me now". 


She grabbed a dom from her little bag, put it on me and then positioned herself at the end of the table with her short legs apart. The view was great and after rubbing some of her juices onto the head of the dom, in I went. She was tight and after some gentle thrusting we started going back and forth. Now this is something i had not expected and whether Tina was horny or glad to see me, I'll never know. I rubbed her clit, tweaked her nipples and did my part. We eventually finished in mish after she pulled me up on the table. A very pleasant afternoon.


I am back on the road again and will probably try to see Tina when i'm in town next but YMMV. This has been after years of patronage so don't expect the same. Tina's massage is amazing to begin with and I was very lucky to get a little extra this time around. 


Until next time.

My experience/comments :
Saw the review above so decided to give this a try. Location is easy to find and entrance is a bit discreet. Walked in the establishment and saw two ladies. Both are in late 40s to 50s. Greeted me and asked me who I want. Picked the tall girl and we went straight up in the room.

Proceed with the massage. I can say the massage was great. Managed to loosen up my back. Then after 45mins of massage, she asked if I want HJ for $20. I told her what else she offers. Since she has a limited english, it was a bit difficult to make her understand if you talk straight english. So, I asked again if BJ ok? And Fuck? Then she finally understand and given me price of $30 for CBJ and $50 for FS. I took FS.

She then removed her clothes and proceed to lick my nipples and started to stroke my cock. Then after put on the dom and suck my dick. Cbj is ok, it was smooth and good. Then later on, she said to fuck her and she lie down on the massage bed. We just did missionary and can't move too much. Was afraid the massage bed would break. Just fuck her continuously until I came.

Then she gave me wet wipes and hot towel. Later on she offered me some chocolates as well. She then told me that during Tuesday there is a young girl working there. I might try it next time.

Overall, it was money's worth. Massage was great and you get FS for cheaper price. But don't expect too much on physical aspects.

A sad day.
Hadn't been to Sun Sun for a while
Went a few weeks ago when I had a Friday off and saw Lily. Surprised she is still working here and the good news is that she is still very multi skilled as a masseur. Did it all again and was planning a return and was going to bring an implement for Lily to use on the front door while I tended to the back. Well I was very disappointed as I initially say the sign was gone and when I went upstairs the door was chained up and the place was empty.
In a way it was surprising the shop lasted as long as it did.
The question is though fellow punters - I know Lily also works elsewhere (Plumpton?) but any assistance appreciated

Sad indeed, this was a regular haunt of mine but the crap entrance meant it was never going to get a constant stream of punters.

But on the positive side there are new places popping up around the Blacktown area so perhaps Lily has moved on to one of those.

Damn! I was hoping to drop in again but haven't been up Blacktown way lately. RIP Sun Sun. We had some good times.

My experience/comments : 
Very well kept and looked after venue. Small reception and waxing area upstairs, at least ten massage rooms downstairs. Reallly freindly service, and great waxing available. Don't really get to pick the girls but they are awlays great looking and do a wonderful job. Good english too, and good mix of culltures. 
Went in for a back and shouders waxing ($60), and then a 1hr massage B2B ($65+$50). Pampered for ages. Good waxing, no ingrowns or anything. Then asked if I wanted a massage and taken downstairs. 
Great firm massage, can tell they are actually trained. She let my hands always be busy. Really good conversations too. Flipped me over, we discussed extras, got a great B2B (although I woulld describe it more as a nude HJ where you can touch them, not much full body to body contact). Would say they are a bit more strict than others (no kissing, no pussy touching, etc), but I guess that goes with the size and location of the venue. Nice massage after finishing, offer to shower. No rush on time, and exit through and elevator that makes you appear like you just visited one of the offices above. 
Great location and service. I would say this is my 'regular' and I've never been dissapointed.

My experience/comments :

So I put a thread up a while back about what's on offer out towards Bathurst and Orange... the general consensus was 'fuck all' and I can 100% confirm that.  I tried a couple of privates on Locanto that never messaged back, I went and had a drive-by of the Gateway brothel in Orange but it's in a residential area and I was in a massively signwritten car, not much else around so wouldn't be hard for someone driving past to figure out why I was parked around the corner...

I stopped in at Bathurst Thai Massage on the way home.. got a great massage from a young lady who said she had been working in Moree for a while but the boss opened this shop up in Bathurst so here she was.  Massage itself was excellent, she really got stuck into me, and on the flip she gave a great frontside massage including getting up into the groin and whatnot... but it was all business, she was very careful not to brush up on anything she wasn't supposed to.

Shame really as she was quite cute, but it seems Bathurst isn't the place for a RnT.. I'm heading back out there in a couple of weeks so might try another couple of shops but I'm thinking they'll be a similar experience..

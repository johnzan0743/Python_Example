My experience/comments : It was early on a Sunday morning scrolling through the usual sites when I come across a local massage shop that looked promising so I called up and booked ahead, got there and the waiting room by the front door and everyone walking past can see straight through. Out come Lucy and took me to the room and left me to undress, I look around for all the signs of a RnT place and yep they where there.... back come in Lucy and started the massage which was pretty decent a bit of brushing of the balls then come the flip pointed to the little man and said him to which i let her go for it... a extra $30 for the tug and I was off. I've got a feeling that is all that's on offer there but I'll most def go back and see what happens in the back rooms of the shop

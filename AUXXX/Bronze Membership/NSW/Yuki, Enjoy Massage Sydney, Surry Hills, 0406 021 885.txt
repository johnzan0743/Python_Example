My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Yuki provides a great straight massage that really helps me after too many hours at a desk. Also, she follows this with a very sensual massage with body slides. She is an expert at a slow ending. I saw here a few years ago at a place in Ultimo but lost touch for a while.

Recently, I stumbled across her at a small massage place off Elizabeth Street, Surry Hills Â– the name and address are above. Yuki looks as good as ever. She is mature but fit, fun and attractive. Her English is not great but good enough so that we can chat about things during the massage.

I have visited her twice in the new location but I doubt I will return. While her service is as good as ever and I enjoy the time with her, the place itself limits the experience. The rooms are so small that the table needs to be moved around during the session. Everyone in the place can hear all conversations. It is hard to ignore everything and get completely involved in the session. Yuki also works at a sister place in Bondi that I have not tried. The location is not great for me and I suspect the location is a similar setup. Maybe I should try it out because I would love to see Yuki in a good establishment.

Yuki works at the Bondi road shop two days a week and you are right, that is also a shoe box shop as well but slightly better with the privacy .

Much better when Yuki was working at 288 Wattle or the old Wishway but her services and skills are worthy of putting up with the sub standard shops !

Always my go to ML for a long time .

Cheers

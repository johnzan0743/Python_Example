My experience/comments : Found them through Cracker. All photos listed are fake including their web page. Nevertheless I did not know this until I entered the shop. So here is my experience.....

The shop itself is inside a shopping complex level 1 and very discreet. Upon entry, I was greeted by a matured age chinese lady (40s). I was kindly escorted to a massage room to wait until a masseause was available. This particular room smelled of left over dinner and was very unpleasant. After waiting for about 5 minutes, I was greeted by another chinese lady in her 40s as well. She took me to another room and I opted for a 1 hour massage. 

First half: The massage was brilliant. I can honestly say it is within the same league as proper chinese massage shops. Lots of playing with the balls which made me extremely horny. 

2nd half: Around the 30 minute mark, I flipped over and offered extras. HJ clothes on = $20 or $50 naked with HJ. She wasnt the most attractive person to look at so I opted for the $20 HJ clothes on. I lasted about 5 min as she teased the hell outta me for the first 30 min. Once I exploded, she cleaned me up well. I still had time left. This is where things got weird. The masseuse disappeared after cleaning me up and 5 min later, the first chinese lady who greeted me at the door took over. She gave me a massage until my time was up. She gave me an excellent 20 min massage. She was fully clothed and by that point, I didnt have enough ammo for a 2nd round. Her name was Linda and I rated her massage better than the first one. Once the massage was finished, got dressed, Linda said bye and that was it. No hug or kiss when I left. The massage and HJ was good.


Overall: Bad smell from the masseuse's dinner which can be a turn off. Plenty of other choices in Sydney that charge $60 ph + $20 HJ. Massage was decent. Both spoke Ok English. Wasnt difficult in asking what I want and they understood me well.

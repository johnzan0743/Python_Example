My experience/comments:
Was bored on the Saturday afternoon after finished shopping at Auburn COSTCO and felt like getting a massage. I remembered a friend has given me an address to visit in Auburn. As the address is only two  minutes drive from Auburn COSTCO , I decided to give it a go and drive directly to the address without an appointment.
The address is an old style three bed rooms house near the intersection of Rawson Rd. I saw the sign OPEN and decided to ring the bell. A lady believed to be the owner/mamasan greeted me and was led into a front waiting room. I was told one lady wold be available in ten minutes time.
I was then led to a room by Linda .The room is fairly large and is the master bedroom with bathroom and shower attached. She has limited English and I opted for an hour session.There is a small wooden bath /spa and I was recommended to have a hot herbal bath inside it for twenty minutes for an extra $30 but I declined. Stripped to undies and hopped on the table. The massage was good but not the best. After 25 minutes she pulled off my undies and began the stroke and sack play and I was asked if I wanted the penal massage for an extra $30. I took up the offer and it was the massage of the groin , anal and prostrate area. I did not find her professional and skilful enough as compared with the one I experienced in West Ryde Ausfeng with Susan several years ago (She has since retired). Her HJ technique was average . I left after a hot shower. On the way out I saw the other lady and she is a MILF as well and appears slightly more attractive.
Will I go back? Probably not. However, this place is  not too bad if you donâ€™t mind a massage by middle-age female and the shower facility is a big plus in winter. The other room has no shower room attached but you can use the othe bathroom at the back.

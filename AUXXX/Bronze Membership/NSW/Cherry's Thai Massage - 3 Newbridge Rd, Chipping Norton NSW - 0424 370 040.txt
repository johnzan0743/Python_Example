My experience/comments :

Came to this place with no booking, and Angie led me to a nice clean room with mood lighting, surrounded by curtains. She was wearing black shorts and a black singlet that revealed some nice cleavage  Settled for a 30 min massage, and I asked whether I should take everything off, and she said "if you like"...I like that answer. So I lied down on the towel-covered table naked, and noticed that there's a hole in the middle to place your junk, cool. I then asked if she does body slides, and she said "relaxing massage only"...alrighty then. 

After about 25mins of some decent oil massage, in which her hands rubbed my back, arms, legs and thighs (very close to the balls), she started chatting on how time flies. I asked if I should turn around now, and if she's going to massage the front as well. Not sure if she was acting dumb (probably), but eventually she was like "OHH *handjob gesture*, that's $30!", yes please. So she got some oil and got to work. The technique was great, and I was grabbing her bum and tits as she was doing that. Tried to get those tits to pop out from her singlet but she smiled, moved away and said "sorry", super polite. Soon enough, I got the relief that I wanted. Angie was cute, super friendly and polite like a Japanese gal, even when I was rubbing my hands all over her. I had a pleasant time and would definitely recommend this place.

Hi HM,

Just a question on pricing, was it $45 for 30 minute and another $30 for the happy ending?

Cheers

Must be; I did a search first but couldn't find anything, I guess because I'm still on Bronze :/

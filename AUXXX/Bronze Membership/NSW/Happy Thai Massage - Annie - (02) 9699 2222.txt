My experience/comments : 
Had to ring the bell to be let in, which means standing outside on the busy street looking a but suspicious... 
Once inside, shown straight to a room, asked if I've been before, etc, asked how long I want, was a bit surprised at the higher than norm pricing ($60 usually gets you an hour IME). Picked 45 mins since my parking spot became a clearway from in 60 mins and I didn't want to get my car towed (watch out for that, morning and afternoon peak parking is probably going to be a bit more difficult).
Was asked if I wanted a pre-shower, which was nice since I'd been at work all day, probably makes it a better experience for both of us... shower was nice and clean too.
Back to the room, starts the normal massage, turn over, continues with a pretty normal massage, and then whispers something (missed it, but along the lines of do you want anything extra), I agreed, and then clarified what we were talking about. I think it was $50 for HJ or $80 for something else... sorry, can't remember, it wasn't FS, but something vague extra. For $50 she got naked, nice mini strip tease, straight into the HJ (no tickle at all), touching was allowed, but she kept her panties on, maybe thats what the extra $30 was for...

Anyway, she worked it well, and expanded into more touching etc as needed until the requisite result was accomplished. A nice cleanup, offer to use the shower again, and a glass of water with some lollies was provided on a nice tray.

Overall, the experience was good, the table was a bit uncomfortable as the cushy part didn't extend to the edge, and there was a hard wooden frame around it, the floor was a bit creaky, and the walls don't go up to the ceiling so you can definitely hear your neighbours.

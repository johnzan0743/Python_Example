Is this Dara Thai Massage at number 2/34 Fisher Rd - ground floor on the right as you walk in from the street, X2386?

Is "the far one" the Thai at no. 32?

My experience/comments : Looking for somewhere on the northern beaches which is usually pretty slim pickinsg, but this place seems okay. Initial massage was pretty good actually, for a rub and tug place. Almost felt legit! When it came for turn over time she only offered HJ for 20, but it was a great HJ. Sat reverse cowgirl style and tugged away. Lovely girl with a great personality as well. Managed to get a parking fine as well... watch out for those rangers, I only over parked for 10 minutes and BAM, another $100 gone!

Thanks wachumba.

This thread is in the Massage Parlour section of the Main Forum which Bronze members dont have access to. When Pan reaches Silver level his reviewed will be moved there.

If you post some more complying reviews you will soon get there Pan. By the way, always ask and remember the provider's name as service between them can vary greatly even in the same shop.

On the main forum page under General reviews, it states 'This forum is only visible to Bronze Members' so i thought they could see that part.

Nice find wachumba. That is an error, it seems it has been there since the early days of the Forum(possibly before the Bronze Lounge was started) and no one has noticed it.  
Its on the agenda to be corrected.

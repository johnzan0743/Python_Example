My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

so i was looking for a legit massage and with name like  Family Massage i thought this would be one. I go in greeted by thai lady, average looking, late 40s and she walks me past all the curttin sided massage tables into a small room. She says take off your clothes and lay down. I strip off lay down and wait. She comes in starts a very average massage and then on the flip starts rubbing my leg and ask me if I want happy ending. I say sure, she says $40 I say $30, she says we charge $40. I couldnt be bothered arguing so i say ok. She gives me standard hj and I shoot a load. As she is cleaning me up she says we should go out, I say maybe, she says why not (because my wife wouldnt like it I'm thinking). Anyway clean up done I head home.

Would I return? Maybe

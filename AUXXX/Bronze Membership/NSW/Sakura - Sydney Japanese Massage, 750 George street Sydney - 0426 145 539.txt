My experience/comments : Sakura is a pretty good pick for me, i usually see her for 1h with 2 shots NHJ... First time i tried her, there was a cheeky kinda playful smile from her which was quite intoxicating. I think her level of service is quite exceptional. Plenty of the usual, tackle tickle, teasing and slow sensual HJ..
Im pretty reserved about the exchange of fluids etc so do not partake in kissing or pussy slides, but i am certain this would also be offered... what gets me is the little things... like i'll be on my front and she'll be massaging my back, then proceed to massage my hands.. you know its "go" time when she places one of her boobs unexpectedly on your open hands. That to me is quite cool... i think she just enjoys teasing the shit out of you... which is exactly my cup of tea!

Plenty of fun with her, she's easy going, easy to chat to, and eager to please. Would highly recommend!

Sounds like a place I need to visit. Does it have a shower by chance?

This place has a really dodgy looking lift at the bottom of it. Also a Thai massage shop on either side of which both are legit.

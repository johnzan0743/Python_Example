My experience/comments:

Popped in while i was in Windsor for a job interview. First impressions are alright, nice discreet back entry. Mamasan was nice and polite, she broke down the service for me told me what it was about. Decided to go for 30 mins for my first time here.

I moved into the room didnt get to choose the girl though a lovely young thai girl walked in estimate she was mid 20s. She instructed me to get my gear off and lay on the bath/table so i did. She began t to wash me down with warm water and began to scrub softly with some exfoliating gloves. Did a massage/scrub all over my back legs etc. washed me off and got me to flip over repeat on the front. She then began to grab the oil and give a HJ with no prompting which was nice. 

Didn't ask about her getting nude (though i probs should of she was hot!) I blew my load she washed it off with the warm water and began to give me a head massage. Time finished and she gave me a towel to dry off and i got dressed while she took the matt from the bath and got new gloves for the next person. 

All in all if you go for a massage with a handy - not too bad my body feels great afterwards. If you want a nude massage etc probs not the place for you.

I would return depending what i was looking for that day. 

PS if someone can get a lady from here to do FS, Nude/nuru etc lettuce know! would be interesting to go back and try again! 

Signing off till next time!

Please always ask and remember the name of the provider as service can be very provider specific. I know it can be difficult with some accents but please try hard.

Don't waste your time here
Go Ashley"s in George st Windsor for a much better time
$100 in Windsor is robbery
But that is My Humble Opinion

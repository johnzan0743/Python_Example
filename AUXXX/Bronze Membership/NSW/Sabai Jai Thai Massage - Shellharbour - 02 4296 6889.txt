My experience/comments : I was at the movies and saw this newly renovated place near Shellharbour Square. Thought I would give it a crack. Walk in and greeted by an older Thai lady. 20% off deal at the moment as its been closed for a while and new reno's new location. Gave half hour a crack at $40 (usually $50). Its all new and nice and she takes me to the room tells me to get undressed and as I swing around I see a sign "Please leave underwear on". I thought should I walk now? haha Nahh I have seen other signs that didn't mean much at other premises so I thought lets try this place anyways.

Massage was not that good for deep tissue. It wasn't consistent and wasn't that deep. I asked for more pressure but I could tell she just wasn't in it and didn't know how to do it properly. I have been spoilt by awesome deep tissue massages by another Thai lady at Sunshine Coniston but she left a while ago and no one has come close since. So the massage was in my opinion crap!! She cleans the oil off and says ok finished I asked for extra she declined.

So all up for me it was a waste of money with poor massage and no extra finish at this place.

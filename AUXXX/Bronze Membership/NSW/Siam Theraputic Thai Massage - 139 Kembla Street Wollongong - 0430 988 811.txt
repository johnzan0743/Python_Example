Value for money/recommend? : Yeah, it was pretty good, would go back.

My experience/comments : I've been sampling the local thai massage  places lately as the  Wollongong FS market has gone downhill bigtime and  due to aches and  pains.  Saw Amy early afternoon for a 1hr oil  massage and the hope of extras.

She gave me about half an hour of good solid oil massage, right into the aches and pains.  After she got me to turn over the usual questions of extras came up, so to speak.  We settled on topless HR for $50, I am pretty sure a lot more was on offer but was too relaxed to make any real effort.  She gave me a slow and tasty oily HR, allowed plenty of fondling of her chest and covered areas ... offered several times to see if I wanted more off for more $$.

In general this is a tidy place with private rooms.  The location is pretty busy, the parking onstreet not the best.  Have only been here once, but I think from the mercury adverts that it is safe to assume that most / all the  girls offer happy endings.  Happy enough with the place, would go back, prefer absolute Thai in Dapto but thats just me (location, parking).  Still I think a good Thai massage beats a chinese massage or visit to the cheaper knock shops.

My experience/comments : 

Had a while to kill so dropped into this joint, early morning just after opening (around 10).  They were still dusting floors and cleaning, as usual started with the "have you been here before question" ... off to the more private room near the bathroom / shower.  Got a pretty good mixed oil / thai massage, very relaxing, hit all the spots.  After turn over I got the "would you like me to massage here" ... to which the answer was "sure, why not" ... we negotiated $120 for hour massage and HR with gear off, HJ was very soothing and skilled, happy for my hands to wander around, simulated a BJ for a while which was really good.  Pretty confident she would have been up for more, real BJ or even more, not sure.  After completion off to the shower (good water pressure!).  She was a chatty skilled chick, a bit older than some may like, but good english and very pleasant, would recommend.

Person's Name : Aani

Establishment : Siam Therapeutics 

Date of Visit : 14/10/2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 139 Kembla St Wollongong 

Phone : 0430 988 811

Hours of Business : 9am - 9pm

Rates : $45 half hour massage plus extras

Age : 40s 

Size/shape : Medium Build

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage & Handjob

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Sore after a week of sleeping funny so thought I'd give Siam Therapeutics a crack. Have been here several years ago so a return visit was on the cards. 
Booked in and when arrived greeted by a older Thai women who introduced herself with the customary Thai greeting. She lead me off too the nicely decorated private room to get ready and said she would be back in a few mins. Took off all the gear and lay down on stomach so she would have a idea that I'd be wanting extras. Anyway she comes back and the massage begins.
Its a good massage and she gets into all the spots I'm sore in without the sometimes painful elbows done masseuses like to engage in. No tickle tackle at all but long sweeping strokes just short of touching the family jewels give the indication that more is on offer. Around the 20 minute mark I ask her if she does extras and she answers by softly running her fingers across my balls and saying " you mean this"?. I ask her her what she does and she says what are you after ? I say how about a handjob or a blowjob ? She asks me how much I want to pay. A bit of haggling back and forth and we settle on $25 for a HJ. Not sure if a BJ or FS could have been achieved but I'm guessing it could have been for extra cash. 
Anyway a very sensual HJ she provides with a corkscrew action and no hurry. I didn't try and feel her up as I'm thinking she wanted more cash for the HJ so I better not get her upset. So eventually she makes me blow my cork and she cleans up. 
Shes a nice lady that is very professional and caring.

Person's Name : May

Establishment : Siam

Date of Visit : 5/7/19

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Phone : 0430988811

Hours of Business : 9am to late

Rates : $70hr massage + extras

Age : 20's

Size/shape : medium build, nice bust 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Was ok

My experience/comments : This place appears to have changed owners, no real difference except the front counter lady takes the dosh and sends out the girl - which was ok except getting change required me to ask several times, something to be careful of.

The girl herself was a very effective thai masseuse - proper thai massage, some oil massage and then a top of HJ.  Did the top off HJ for $70, did a most satisfactory HJ!  

Convenient discreet place, but be careful on the change if the new owner continues as she did with me !

 Siam Therapeutics at Kembla St Wollongong

Person's Name : Jessica 

Establishment : Siam Therapeutics 

Date of Visit : August 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 139 Kembla St Wollongong 

Phone :0430988811

Hours of Business : 9am-9pm

Rates : $70/hr plus tip

Age : Mid 30s?

Size/shape : Slim, size 5-6, B cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage + nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Nope!

My experience/comments : I haven't had a 'punt' in the Gong for a while. Thought I'd try Siam, a new place for  me. I was met by Jessica, a slim mid 30s Thai ML, and booked an hour. Part 1 was passable, but way too long at over 40 minutes. Zero TT or teasing, but a few strokes with her fingernails on my back & inner thighs got the sounds of approval from me, and a slight laugh from her. I was offered part 2 options: bra & undies on for $50 or completely nude for $80 (these are pretty standard Wollongong rates, unfortunately. There are exceptions, where $50 will get you what $80 cost here). I went with the second option, coz I like to look & touch.
So off comes Jessica's gear, and then she started the race to get me over the line as quickly as possible. I like hard & fast at the end - not at the beginning! Jessica allowed touching all over, and some light labia & clit touching, but no fingers inside, and no lips or tongue anywhere. No prob - I respect anyone's boundaries.
But I've had wonderful times with some of the best, and they've set the bar high: slow or sensual, or sexy and erotically-charged, and all shades in between.
Jessica thought that fast & furious was the best way. Not me ...
She was polite and friendly enough, and I was offered the option of a shower or tissue & washer clean up, and a hot or cold drink & some light conversation.
Jessica works here 2 days a week, and somewhere in Chatswood on the other days. 
There's much better (and worse!) on offer in The Gong.
Will I return?
Nope!

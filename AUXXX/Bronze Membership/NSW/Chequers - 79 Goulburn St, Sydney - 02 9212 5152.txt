The only problem is that the entrance is not very discrete

Heading up to Sydney soon and think I'll give this a try.
Am considering going all out with the Kings Massage.

Any tips on how to get the most out of this place?
Any girl recommended?

I had my first Chequers experience the other week, and I wasn' really sold.

The entrance is a tad open and obvious for my liking, but not an issue once on the stairs. After descending down and into reception, it was completely empty. I looked around confused for a while, and was eventually greeted. Picked the Sweedish, and after getting my key and changing/showering, I sat down in the waiting room. I didn't really get a choice, it was during the day and I probably looked like a confused white dude. 

The massage itself was actually really good. Hard but soft, good pressure and relaxing. On turn over, no extras offered and then out I go. showered again, and headed off into the now colder land.

I don't know if I would give it another shot, maybe if I was near the area again.

My experience/comments : 

In Sydney city from suburbia for the week on business trip. Did originally plan to give mistys a try, but after another long day I couldn't be assed walking that far or getting a cab.

So decided to do a quick google, and remembered chequers.

Very very public entrance. Smack bang in the middle of maloneys Irish pub. The pub has seats either side of the front door with drinkers taking in the sights.
Once in the door it's discrete and down the stairs. Did originally ask for 60 min king body to body which includes a shared shower and rub in shower for $185. But red flag when I was told I had to pay before sighting a girl. For that coin, prefer to invest in a safer bet. 30min it is...
Into the change room, given a locker. If you have a thing about seeing other patrons I would suggest another place. I got changed with 2 other guys. Not quite like other rnt places, you can get massages with not tug here. Showered in large shower room and lead to the head and foot massage area where the girl coordinating the show threw me into a private room and Jessie came in.
Jessie was pretty average looking, probably worse than the avg street side Thai or Chinese massage places.
Very cold and quiet. But once I started asking about her she warmed up.
The massage was very very good, which was my highlight removing knots.
Body slide average and hj plenty of oil but average, just pull hard and fast til I came. Tug was included in this massage.
Given shoulder and head massage, once again very good.
Back to change rooms, this time 3 other punters in there. I found it awkward, not for me.
Showered changed, bailed....will not return

All in all, public entry, semi public change room, good massage, average looker, average tug....way way better to be had for the $$$$$

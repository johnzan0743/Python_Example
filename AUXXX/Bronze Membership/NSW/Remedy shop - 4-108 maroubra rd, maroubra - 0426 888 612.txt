My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

i was in maroubra to get a massage and walked in and was greeted by Alice..approx 45yrs old mlc woman..she is a friendly easy going woman who likes a laugh..

Took the 45 minute option which for me is enough..

Alice does a really good massage with heaps of pressure applied in the right spots and she even walked on my back and down my legs then proceeded to apply oil for the massage. I felt good after it. In the process a fair bit of rubbing close to my nuts which did the trick.

She asked me to turn over, commented on how nice it looked hard and negotiated $20 for the hj of which i thought was ok..flollowed by the clean up after with tissues and wipes etc...
I was not sure if more is on offer with her..

All in all a good massage and ending and can recommend if u need a good massage..

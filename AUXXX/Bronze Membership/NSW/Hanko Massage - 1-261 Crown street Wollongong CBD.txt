My experience/comments : 

So recently checked out the new Hanko, now called something else. Right outside a bus stop, so a bit less private but didn't really care. Up the stairs and was greeted by Linda, first day. Said straight out $150 for 1 hour and B2B. 

Got in the room and she was super friendly and fun, straight away she gets down the bra and panties for a massage, then 15 mins in I help her out of the rest. Does a nice B2B, B cups for a little bit of Spanish, then asks if I want more, said I only had $20 so she pulls out a condom abd sucks away, nice technique and I last aboit 5 mins.

She continues the massage, then I start to massage her and she starts getting horny and asks if I'm up for round 2. I roll her over and get into her pussy with my tongue while I slide my fingers in and out.... She wanted cock bad but I was still exhausted from the BJ so she said next time we'll be going all the way....

]I finished up there then went and had a shower in the huge bathroom/spa bath. Very nice facilities, private locked rooms and will definitely be returning. Linda only on Monday/Tuesday at the moment but saw another super friendly and sexy girl as I was walking to the showers. 

Linda is 32, nice body, short, a little bit of baby damage on the tummy but no big deal, as she makes up for it with enthusiasm and friendliness.

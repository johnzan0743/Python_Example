My experience/comments : had a shit of a day at work and found this place a little while ago, upstairs round the back access and for an hour massage $65 was about average. Was shown to the back room and told to undress ( no mention of keeping the undies on ) I turned the air con on because I was sweating just standing there . She came back and started on the back and legs and at this point everything was legit. 
She moved the towel and found I had nothing on and continued for a bit then left. Then another lady (no better or worse looking) came in and was Cleary up to speed with the happenings. Back and tackle tickles were decent and on the flip took her time and built up instead of the usual hundred mile an hour shake. 
finished with a pop and she cleaned me up but not that great and when asked how much she said up to you. I gave her the $30 I had in change and was on my way a happy Chappy.

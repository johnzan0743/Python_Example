My experience/comments : thought id try this place out as the ad says there is a line up of girls to pick. Never had that so thought id give it a look see. Also said they had a Brazilian and Columbia girl. Maybe if id called ahead i could have decided to not try them if they werent working that day.
Arrived and no one at the desk, ml walks from back to the desk to take my money. Went with 30min for $50. then waited in the room. Nuded up and lied down. then i start to sweat. They had no AC!!!
So i waited and it was hot then the ml came in and it was the same older receptionist. She said how hard i asked for soft. I normally go with medium but i was hoping for some extra tease and tackle tickle this being an included establishment. So began a hot and rather boring 30 minutes. She occasionally did a drive by or a almost drive by but her long nails did not make it feel good rather off putting. finally the flip and a quick and rushed hj to get me done. Oh she also allowed touching for an extra 20 or topless for 50. I was barely ready for the free hj but received it and left rather dissatisfied with the whole endeavor. 
Avoid unless you book perhaps, or at least until they install some air conditioning.

My experience/comments : 

Have been to the eight miles plains sister shop but this one just opened up so decided to give it a try. Walked in and a girl by the name of Cindy greeted me. Took me into one of the rooms and took my money for the massage. Cindy was very thin so not my type so I was glad when Angel walked in. 

Rooms were quite spacious and clean. Didn't ask if they had a shower. 

She seem to be very new to the massage business so I'd say her massage skills were very limited felt like she was just spreading oil over my back. She also couldn't speak much english so made communications bit hard. But otherwise she was quite friendly. Flipped over and offered tug for $50 and nude for $100. I tried nude option. Body would've been perfect if her boobs were a C cup but I guess you can't have it all... had a full bush going too. Allowed me to suck on her tits and finger her which got her breathing heavily whilst she wanked me off. Overall not bad experience and I have a feeling that if I see her a few more times she might be up for more extras.

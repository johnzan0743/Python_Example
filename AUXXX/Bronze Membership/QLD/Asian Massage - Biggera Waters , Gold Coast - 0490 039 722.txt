Post Content: 
Person's Name : Jay

Establishment : Massage Parlour

Date of Visit : 25th November 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0490039722/ 110 Brisbane Road Labrador 

Hours of Business : 9am- 7pm (later by appointment)

Rates : $30/30mins $60/60mins

Age : ~45

Size/shape : Average 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, blowjob, handjob, full service

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : The service was quite average and it felt very rushed. A HJ was alrady +$30, while a BJ was +$100 and full sexy was another $150. So all in all it was about $300 ($50 house fee + $250 for FS) for an average massage and a poor BJ and very very rushed sex. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. Her name is Jay, if visiting ask for anyone but Jay.

Hey everyone, I have been to this place a few times. I stopped going because last time I only had 30 mins to spare, Jay was the ML, and this day it seemed like she was in a hurry. Quick massage and out came the guru gel, flipped over and had a very average (fast and furious) HJ. I ended up with a sore member.

From my experience, they have a high ML turnover. I haven't been tempted to return. I think Jay is the owners wife. They are Korean. The premises are immaculately clean, rear entrance and a shower is available.

They have a website. Check it out for yourself ... DAYDREAM MASSAGE

I'll report back if I ever return there!

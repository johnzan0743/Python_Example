My experience/comments : 

This is a clean massage venue with nice large rooms that appears to offer something special. YMMV!
I waited a short time before a room was available and was shown my room by the ML i met at the desk.....she also happened to be my ML.
Quiet young girl who was nicely spoken wearing a skin tight black mini dress. Was asked to remove my clothes and lay down. On her return she asks if i have been here before.....always say yes  Massage begins with towel covering you and then removed slowly after about 5-10 minutes. Massage is very nice but no TT at all throughout....WTF! Anyway asked to roll over and she offers her extras. Not negotiable....no play either. I say no extras and just receive the massage. It almost killed me but i was strong. 
WIR - I feel this is another one Brisbane's pricey massages. The search continues.......

My experience/comments : Had a bit of time & was in the area so I thought I would give this one a try. I had noticed the slightly dodgy sign on more than one occasion & felt might be in with a chance. Wandered in downstairs & Le Le was sitting there, available. Well dressed in a nice blouse, hinting, but not in ya face. I asked if avail for 30min & straight away was asked if I wanted to be happy. Handed over the 60 & went into a room. Proper room with proper door.  Face down & got an OK massage, she spent a lot of time on the thighs, but not teasing. After quite a while a bit of a tease that was very nice. On the flip a bit of a rub on front then down to business, she got her (very nice) tits straight out & encouraged a play. 
I must note that this lady is not what I would call attractive, but she does have a good set of natural lungs that she seems very proud of.
WIR - perhaps if timing was right. Have had better, have had much worse.

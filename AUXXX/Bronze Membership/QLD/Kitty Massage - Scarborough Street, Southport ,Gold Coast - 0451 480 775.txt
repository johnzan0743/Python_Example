My experience/comments :

 Found this massage shop online in the Locanto classifieds and seemed good value for money being $40 for 30mins and including r&t.  Was greeted by a not bad looking barefoot thai woman around 30-35yo.  Took me to one of the partitions, there are only curtains between all the tables and you can hear everything going on in the next partition.  Very hard massage table and looked like a well used towel with the creases and dampness about it.  She actually gave me a half decent massage and climbed up in the table and got her knees into my back and slid up and down which felt great.  She hardly talked and only gave one word replies and kept her phone between my legs and was walking out of the room often and answering it and then took another customer into the next partition and got him stripped off, i guess, and then came back to me and flipped me over and finished me off while i cupped her ass.   She used hot rocks on my back which was good and never had that before, she slid them up and down.
If she'd been a bit more friendly I might go back but she was in a hurry to get me out the door and very mechanical in her massage approach.
There are showers there but was really dirty and given another half wet, oil soaked towel so just used the corner of it.  I let myself out as she must of been busy with the bloke next to me.
So wouldn't really recommend it unless you're on a tight budget.
Ah, there is much better value out there but takes time and money to find them.  Actually, the main reason I went was because Lily Massage in Nind st. was full and was getting impatient.

Person's Name :  Cindy (Could not really hear her) 

Establishment : Massage in Southport

Date of Visit : October 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : http://goldcoast.locanto.com.au/ID_7...hport-qld.html

Hours of Business : Unknown

Rates : $35 / 30   $60 / 60

Age : 26  may be 30

Size/shape : slim, size 6

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Good for $35

My experience/comments : I had some spare time between appointments so I thought I would try this $35 cheapy. Rang & booked 10 min before arrival. Made my way upstairs & discovered why the lady was so quiet on the phone, she had a very sore throat & could barely speak. Having taken care of the financials went & laid down. The cubicle only had a curtain. Massage was OK, nothing great. On the flip service was mechanical but adequate. Touching was not really allowed. Offered a shower after.
All in all not a great experience, however considering the young lady in question had a very bad throat & the inclusive cost only $35 I feel it is worth another try.It is easy to pay a lot more for no better or even worse. Definately has potential.

so i was in brisbane so i decided to have a punt at this local. It had all the signs of being good. I was met at the door by this cutie named ellie, thought i was in luck because she came out with this short mini skirt and a tight top. She showed me to the room and i undressed and jumped on the table.i waited for about 5 minutes and then this brazillian girl walked in and she looked like a man. I quickly told her i wanted the other girl. Ellie came back and proceeded with the massage. She had a great technique but no touches in any of the places. On the flip she stayed away from the goods as if she was afraid. At the end i asked if there were any extras and she said no. So quickly got up and changed and left.

Apparently you can have a bit more luck at the Thai place next to the coffee club

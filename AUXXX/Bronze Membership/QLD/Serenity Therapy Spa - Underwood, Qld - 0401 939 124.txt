My experience/comments :

There are a lot of massage parlours around this area (Logan City, Qld). I decided to try the above tonight after a long day at work. This being my first time. Made a booking via text and was confirmed very quickly. $60.00 for 60 minutes, relaxation massage. Got in around 5 minutes early and was taking to the room by Jenny. She was around 5"6 tall, slim, with what looked to be a B cup. Japanese from what I could tell but unfortunately I didnt ask or think was important. She gave me time to prepare and came back around 2 minutes later and gave me a nice relaxation massage. I would say a mild out of the mild/medium/hard scale which was nice for the night. She didnt ask too many questions nor did I but asked how it was going every now and then.
While I was on my back she did give me a few tickles every now and then which was nice.. After around 35 minutes she asked me to flip and started massaging the front. After 5 minutes she asked if I wanted extra and I asked how much. $40.00 for a HJ. After asking if she did extra extra was advised no and could touch with cloths on only. Took up the offer and it was ok. I have felt better but it was good overall. After the finish I was cleaned up and a hot towel used to wash my whole body. 
I want to try others around the area first but would come back in the future.

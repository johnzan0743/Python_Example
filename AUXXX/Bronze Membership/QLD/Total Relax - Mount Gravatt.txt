 Total Relax - Mount Gravatt

I saw a groupon deal for this place & figured why not, $29 is better then $60+ to test the waters as it were. Before you laugh at the groupon thing at a guess I would say a 40% success rate with at 85% at least giving good massage.

Anyway turn up & am quite surprised, despite external appearance it is not a traditional asian run massage joint, instead it is all Indian. Older lady manning the front desk & 2 younger ones doing the massages, on slim with a hot bod, the other quite chunky.

Lucky me, not, I got chunky. At least it was a decent relaxing massage, no chance of extras though. Was told quite firmly "leave underware on & facedown on the table, I will be back in 2 minutes". As I found her totally non attractive I did not try pushing the boundaries, however with the slim lady I think I would have tried, just in hope.

All in all not a bad vege massage & I suspect no chance of any additional services.

A review not on our template, no ladies name, no address, no phone number, is of little value to others seeking to book or avoid the lady.    It does not count towards qualification for silver status

My experience/comments :

Was up on the Goldy for a holiday and thought I'd try the nearest shop to my hotel. Busy shop as they had nobody available the first couple of times so I thought it was a good chance of extra attention.

Greeted by a cute but not stunning Japanese girl. English quite poor, but we could interact well enough to learn she is on a working holiday in Australia and never massaged prior to working at this shop.

A nice sensual massage, didn't really work out any kinks. I was nude the whole time as as we got to the end she asked if I wanted extras for $30. Why not?

She diligently went to work, I asked if she'd strip off but a firm "No". The room was literally a wall away from reception, and the walls didn't go to the ceilings so sound was a concern too. I asked if I could feel her breasts on the outside of her top, "No" again. I offered $50, and after some thought she agreed if outside only.

Her HJ technique started very gently and was great, though as we neared time she did switch to jack hammer. Which to her credit got me there.

Nice girl, good HJ technique. But I doubt there's any more on offer from her.

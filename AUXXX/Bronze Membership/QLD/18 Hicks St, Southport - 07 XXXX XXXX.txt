My experience/comments : Went along to this cause i had a free couple of hours, i was surprised as they both have done there hair from previous encounters. Paid the hour because i just wanted to relax. Rooms were quiet and large. massage was great as she was strong , on the roll over she asked any extras today i said yes so its $50 for nude and a tug.

she removed all her clothes and she was quite nice not too chubby {as ive seen it before} but nice firm ass. Let me suck on her tits and play with her clit. She was wet before anything was going. Her hj was average but she definately had nice long strokes. i came, but she kept stroking which was great..she wanted to extract everything. So my experience if you want a sure bet these girls are consistent.

Thank you for your review steve2013.

Many members after they see an ad will want a second opinion (about the glowing description and lovely pictures) from punters like themselves.

The best way to do this is from the ad's phone number, Advanced Search > Search Titles Only > "1234 5678" (or 1234 567 890"), so I'd like to update the thread with the phone number if one can be posted.

Was this the ad, Massage relaxation, Southport - Beauty Southport ?

If not, please post a weblink (with the phone), the number if you have it, or an indication that it's a CL or Locanto reply only.

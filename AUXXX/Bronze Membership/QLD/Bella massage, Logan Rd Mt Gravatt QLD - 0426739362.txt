My experience/comments : I have often wondered about this place as I drove past so I bit the bullet & gave it a try. Was greeted OK, handed over the cash & then down to business. Below average massage with absolutely no tickle. I was wondering if I would come up dry, but then asked to roll over, a bit of a chest rub, then the question was asked in a very off handed, uninterested way. In all honesty if I didn't have a sever itch I would have passed on the scratching. Requested tips was exorbitant but got it down to something sorta acceptable for a basic. I shouldn't have bothered, was possible the worst punt I have ever had with a result.

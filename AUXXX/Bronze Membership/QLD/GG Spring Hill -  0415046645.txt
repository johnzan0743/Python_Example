My experience/comments : 



Went here for an early afternoon massage. Great punctual communication via text, I arrived on time and was told to buzz my way up to the apartment. 

GG answered the door in full nude, looked great with a astonishing body. No older than 35, but not younger than 25. Hard to pick the thai girls.

I was offered a shower but as i'd showered just before arrived she was happy with that and had me lay down after the money was exchanged. Very polite, not too talkative but was keen for an interesting conversation.


No BJ/CBJ was offered, just a massage, body slide and hand relief. Excellent quality massage, if you are looking for this you should consider the hour as she is no doubt professionally trained, making sure it wasn't too soft or hard throughout.

After chatting for quite a while (about food and cooking) receiving an excellent massage I was asked to turn over when she grabbed some oil and lubed me up. 

Very sensual body slides and rubbing on her b-c fantastic tits. No awkwardness at all, straight into it after. 

She inquired how exactly I liked it, which was nice, and mentioned that light touching on her was OK. Fantastic body to look at.

Went a little overtime (5 minutes or so) but being a respectful first time customer she didn't seem to mind and invited me back anytime, which I definitely will be, probably for a longer massage!

Very nice apartment too everything was neat and tidy, smelt nice etc.

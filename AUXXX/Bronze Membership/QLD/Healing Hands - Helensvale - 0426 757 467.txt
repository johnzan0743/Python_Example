My experience/comments : Had the best Lomi Lomi massage here by Sheila. She poured  heaps of oil over the table and got me to lay down face first as she ran  her fingers teasingly up & down my body for an hour. A wonderful  finish in the end, I would certainly recommend her for anyone at the  northern end of the Gold Coast. For an extra $50 she will go topless and let you play.

Services Provided : rnt 

Value for money/recommend? : a little overpriced 

My experience/comments : 

No appointment needed, private lockable rooms. 

Lots of signs around saying no sexual services but I always lie on the table naked with a towel covering me for just incase. 

Luna's massage skills where pretty good, after 20mins of a nice massage I was asked to turn over, she gave me the hand gesture for a happy ending, I nodded. 

She said $30 for hand or $50 for topless. I asked if she would do naked or a bj but she said they are only allowed to do topless at the most. I opted for the $30 option. She had great skills and I was finished quickly.

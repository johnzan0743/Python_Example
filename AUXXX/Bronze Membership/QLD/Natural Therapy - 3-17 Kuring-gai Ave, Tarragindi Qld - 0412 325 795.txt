My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

I've frequented this venue on a number of occasions. I decided to visit this place on a whim on my day off. I entered the place without a booking at around 1pm. I was greeted by Michelle and requested for a 30 mins massage. There are two massage rooms but the walls don't go up to the ceiling so you can hear anybody that coming in and out. Anyway, as I was keen for a massage I requested for 30 minutes and was quickly led into one of the rooms and handed over a $50. She left and I stripped off and made my way to the table. A few moments later she returned and placed the $10 change on top of my clothes. No towels are present to cover you during the massage so you're in your birthday suit throughout the massage  

She asked for what kind of massage and I replied with hard. Michelle was relatively skinny and had some deep acne around her cheeks so nothing exceptional in the looks department. Her skin was slightly tanned and all the ML's at this place are from PRC.

In my experience, the girls at this place do a decent hard massage in the 30 mins working the back and legs with minimal oil. This was no exception and she did a decent in that regard. Chatting with the ML was non-existent as I knew there was another punter in the room next door and I didn't want to disturb the tranquility.

After the back and legs were done she left the room to get some a hot towel and warm water to wipe me down. After that it was turn over time. Michelle then began massaging around the chest and groin region which naturally caused a rise of little brother. It didn't take long for it get hard. My left hand began to touch her hip and ass and I raised 3 fingers. She agreed on the $30. She didn't immediately proceed on the HJ and I was initially concerned that nothing was going to happen because she moved over the right hand side of the table and continued to massage the groin area. 

Some moments later she began a fairly mechanical tug with little emotion. There's no real flirtatious behaviour to get you in the mood. It definitely seemed like a job instead of taking pleasure out of seeming someone blow. Anyway, after a few minutes it was clean up time. 

I gave a $50 note and she returned back with $20 change.

This place always has a variety of ML's with most only working 1-2 days per week.

Hi fartichoke

I can confirm that it is a branch of "natural massage" in spring hill. However the 36 Little Edward Street, Spring Hill closed down in December 2014. They've relocated to a new premises at 1/500 Boundary Street called Bamboo Massage. 

The prices at their Spring Hill venue are also more expensive at 30 mins/$45, 45 mins/$60, 60 mins/$70 and 90 mins/$105. However this facility is bigger with about 4 separate private rooms plus offers shower facilities. The only issue I've found is that there's a restaurant downstairs so sounds travels through the floors.

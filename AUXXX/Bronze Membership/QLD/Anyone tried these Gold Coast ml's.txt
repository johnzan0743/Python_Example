Has anyone tried these Gold Coast ml's, in considering trying one but hoping for a review before I choose a punt. Both private, here are the ads:

Any help would be useful. 
Cheers guys,

Go to Carey. I saw her once but it was unofficial as it was by chance and she wasn't advertising at the time. Give it a shot and do a proper review â˜º

My experience/comments : 

Been here before, but never had anything sexual offered. It's a pretty legit looking place with good massages (although there is a male masseuse so you might want to call ahead). Doors to some of the rooms open to the seating area which isn't ideal. 

Walked in fully expecting a legit massage and lay down with boxers on. Some good fun conversation going on even with her broken English. Massage was good, with some suggestive touching. Flipped over and had a half chub. Massage continued along the legs and groin area (still had boxers on)! Several brushes with my balls later, I was sporting a full mast. She offers a HJ for $50 or topless HJ for $100. Only had enough cash for a HJ so went with that.

HJ was mechanical, there was a lot of ball play too. Unfortunately wasn't able to perform. Jane felt bad and offered to give me a free 'upgrade' if I came back and saw her (I assume this is a topless HJ if I paid for another HJ).

Massage: 8/10
HJ: 6/10
Girl (attitude): 9/10
Girl (looks): 6/10

Would I recommend? Probably not if you're just after a HJ, but I'd go back for the massage and see if I can squeeze some freebies or cheap extras.

My experience/comments : 

Found by searching "massage" on google maps.
Walked in and was met by another prettier asian lady.
Paid for the massage and led to a room where I stripped down and waited a few mins.
Iluni massaged my back and legs for a while (the whole time I thought it was the other lady). It was not a great rub tbh, fairly random, but relaxing all the same. She told me to turn over and she massaged my front a bit longer. At this point I just wanted it over and done with. She grabbed the old fella and communicated that she could do that and take top off for $100. Yeah that wasn't happening, which was disappointing, as she seemed to have an amazing rack under the top. I offered $50, and she said yes, but clothes on. The rub was like a jackhammer and I struggled to get it up actually. Had to ask her to slow down, then I was over the line in about 2 mins. 

Summary: Too expensive, and the finish mechanical and unsatisfactory. Maybe another lady here might do better. Avoid this lady if you give the shop a go.

Cheers,
AS

Reviews on here for Brissy are pretty few and far between so TOFT
Nice venue, clean tidy looks legit tbh. 
Asked up front if they offered HE. Niko was behind the counter and whilst slightly older is pretty decent on the eyes. So went for it. 
Massage was excellent, she has a great technique nice firm pressure as good as any normal legit place. 
Claims she's the best there I could probably believe it too. 
Basically a normal massage until asked to flip. 
Then straight on with oil and tried to wake the old fella little bit of tickle but really mechanical. 
Same for the HE basically just went quick and I had to ask a couple of times before she slowed down as I wasn't really hard yet.
I'm pretty gentle never had any complaints ever, it's not in my nature; but she said I was massaging her boobs too hard.. so i asked if I could give her nipples a suck instead.. she let me for about 1 or 2 mins until I was properly hard then said she was too sensitive... okkk so I just lie back and think of england with a hand on her ass...

So generally if you want an excellent  massage and aren't fussed about the HE yeah YMMV but for me not worth a return.

My experience/comments : First impressions were very low.  The place is just an old house converted into a massage parlour.  Once I entered I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was.  I was greeted by an Asian lady - Grace who took me into a private room.  The massage was fantastic, would og back for that alone.  Once it was time to turn she kept glancing at my soldier until finally asking whether I wanted "extra".  I said yes, she oiled up and went to it.  Started off nice and slow, gradually building up the pace.  Didn't take me long to finish at all.  She cleaned me up with a hot towel and that was that.

Services Provided : massage, HE

Value for money/recommend? : Yes - for good massage and HJ only - no other extras offered

My experience/comments : Was driving to airport and thought I would relax myself before my flight . Phoned ahead and booked 30 minutes. Arrived and was met by a very attractive young lady dressed in a short, figure hugging blue dress....impressive. She shows me to the room, takes the money, asks me to take clothes off and leaves the room. The room has full wall to wall privacy and is very clean and air conditioned - perfect on a hot day 

She returns. I find out her name is Stella. She puts a towel over me and begins the massage. A great legit massage on my back including getting on the table and using her knees on my back and bum. I like a strong massage so we are off to a good start. After 10 minutes or so she removes the towel and starts very soft strokes up and down my back and around the tops of my thighs...but no accidental touching.

She asks me to turn over and starts on the tops of my legs. I ask for special. She says "this one" pointing to you know where. I ask how much - $50 is the answer. I ask if that is nude - no. Can I touch - no. So I say no too....lol. She then puts a towel over my middle area and starts massaging my legs some more. She asks again do I want? In the end we agree on $30 for HJ only. She did a good job and soon it was all over. She then got a bucket of water and had a container of liquid soap. She put soap on my, the used a face washer and the warm water to clean me up and then dried me with a towel...very enjoyable. She repeated this on my back

I was offered water...drank that and left

Stella is smoking hot....but offered only HJ. I asked if I came back again would she look after me...no. Such a shame.

Does anyone have any recommendations for someone at GTM who provides good extras?

Value for money/recommend? : I would try this place again but ask for a different ML. Sounds like others can provide better service.

My experience/comments :
This was my 2nd try at a massage parlour. I called up and made a booking around an hour before arriving. I picked this place based on a few reviews I have read which looked good. I went in around 5 minutes before my time. Small but nice reception area which was unmanned. A ML came out and escorted me to the room to get undressed and returned around 5 minutes later. She asked how my day was and the usual small talk. I asked her name, Mandy. I requested for her to walk on my back to help relax me and we got started. Overall the massage was good although it felt rushed. The back walk was great and very relaxing. She asked how it was going around 3 times throughout the session but always sounded like she was in a hurry and was going through the motions. 

Around 45 minutes in we went to the flip and she offered a HJ. I asked if they offer any other extras and she said 'only this'. I asked if I could touch below the belt and she said pretty sharply 'No, only this. You want or not'. It was a pretty hectic day so I opted for it anyway which was all mechanical, no love. She mentioned during the HJ that some others may offer 'extra extra' but not her. I finished up, paid and left. I actually regretted saying yes as it didnt seem to please me at all. 

Overall I may try this place again but different a different ML.

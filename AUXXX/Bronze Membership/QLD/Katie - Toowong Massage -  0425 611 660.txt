My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)
Had some time to spare at Toowong. Remembered seeing a shop in High St some time ago. I am sure it has been reviewed in the past, but new current intelligence is always useful as situations change.
So I entered the shop to be immediately welcomed by a lovel HAB. Well spoken and attractive. Agreed on service and led to room. 
After I was comfortable, the massage started. The massage was average with some tackle tickle to let me know more was on offer. 
On the turn, I was offered option1. $50 extra with topless which I accepted. Katie is quite lovely, easy to talk to and has soft skin. Happy to allow a nuzzle on lovely natural titties with a very good finish,. Other extras on offer, but you have to go to find out
Shop has clean separate rooms and calming background music, the oils are non aromatic. Overall a good experience. 
WIR ? Yes, absolutely.

My experience/comments : I've been reading some great stories through these forums about some of the shops along the Gold Coast Highway (Mermaid Beach). So I decided to take a punt since I was in the area. Firstly, it's been a while since I've driven down this way, and I was quite surprised at the number of shops that have now popped up here. Then again I'm relatively new to the scene and have probably passed these places and thought nothing of them. Well now my eyes have been opened and it seems this is all I ever see these days. Anyway, so my first pit stop was at the Pink Mermaid Oriental and unfortunately that's where the story ends as I'm sure it was a young boy that provided the massage. I assumed like most places he was only there to greet and usher people to the rooms, however as I later learnt, that was not the case. I was fighting every urge to grab my stuff and walk before I realized I had paid money upfront.

Has anyone had any different experiences here?

xSiteU, as I said before reviews without a providers name are not much use. Ask them and write it down next time.

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)
Felt like a R N T on the way home from work.
Communications all done by text and easy to do.
Private house Kitchener Rd. Felt more than a bit obvious standing on front step as there is a bus stop nearby.
English isn't her strong point. I think the photos are real but outdated and she's wearing a very good bra as she'd only be  a B
After me having a shower she stripped off naked and straddled my legs and actually gave me a decent massage. When it came time for the flip she whispered in my ear if I wanted to turn over. Quite liked that.
I thought I'd try and return the favour and practised my limited massage skills on her.
It must have worked as she slipped on a dom, got me half hard and cowgirled me. Wasn't expecting that!
A few positions later on possibly Brisbane's nosiest bed we both collapsed sweating profusely.
Had a bit of a chat and a joke about Chinese girls liking to "jiggy jiggy" and I'm gone skipping up the road.
WIR - No kissing always bugs me, maybe.

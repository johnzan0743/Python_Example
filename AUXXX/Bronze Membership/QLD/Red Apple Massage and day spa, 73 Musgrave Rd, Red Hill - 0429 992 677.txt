My experience/comments :


Day trip to Brisbane this week for a client meeting and found myself with some free time prior to the return flight. Having been here a few years ago (sign out Side still says Yi's Massage and Spa), i decided to take a punt. Arrived late afternoon without a booking and showed in. Relieved by the  air con as it was a stinker of a day outside. Handed over the cash and shown into a longish room which i recognised from all those years ago. A lot more decorative stuff than last time i noticed. 


Now for context, my last visit a coupl eof years ago had been a fruitful one. I gone in late (after 8pm) and gotten a lovely petite and athletic Korean lass who gave me a great massage and an even greater HE. I can still remember the intimacy of it. 


So expectations were set set but that was my own mistake. They have either cleaned up or not offering any fun stuff during the day. Anna was very professional and i knew what was up when i was asked to undress down to my briefs. Slightly disappointed but enjoyed the very good massage which helped me nap on the flight back home. i was even asked to leave a google review. 


Wish work would send me to the Gold Coast where there is a little more action... or is there?


Till next time...

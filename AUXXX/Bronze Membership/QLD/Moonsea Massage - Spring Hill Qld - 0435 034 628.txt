My experience/comments :

I have been to this place numerous times on my monthly visits to Brisbane. I've always just arrived as there will only be two to three girls available in 4 small rooms. 

Miko was the prettiest as they lined up. Although less of a line-up and more hanging around the back.

She was wearing a short black dress. It could have been a nighty but passable as a an outside dress. Modestly dressed otherwise.

As she massaged she would pass he pussy over my arm. Was a weird technique Ive not had. Imagine her leaning over my back with my arm between her legs.

She'd let me rub her legs gentle but pushed away if getting to high. Toward the end she was quite clear. $50 HJ. As it was very obvious I was ready. She allowed me to touch anywhere, not inside. 

Finished quickly and left 

The worst part of this place is that there are no shower and it's a little grubby and feels unclean.
The rooms don't have walls all the way to the top, the girls have a policy of skirts and dresses.

Girls are always friendly with often suprisingly good English. Massage is also generally good.
You will not find photos online and often don't answer their phone. 

@Mods this is the only girl I know her age.

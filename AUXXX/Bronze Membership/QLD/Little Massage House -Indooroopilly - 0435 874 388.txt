Value for money/recommend? : No (see below)

My experience/comments : Was feeling like a good massage after work so tried my usual haunt at Taringa who were totally booked out, so since LMH is on the way home I thought I’d give them a try.  Initially they were also busy, however the very friendly receptionist suggested I wait in their waiting area for a few minutes as someone hadn’t shown for their booking and if he didn’t arrive soon I could have it.  The guy did show up but something was amiss as he left about 30 seconds after arriving so it was game on!
Soon after Jenny (pretty sure that was her name, she had quite a strong accent) arrived and started massaging me.  She offered to do a proper Thai massage which was great, even did a bit of back walking. Time for the flip and a nice ending ensured, I tipped her $100 and was on my way.  
This would have been a great punt except for one thing.  She didn’t bloody shut up the whole time I was there.  I don’t mind a bit of chat but I don’t need to know all about her sisters problems back in Thailand or how she commutes from Coolangatta every day, I just want to lie there for an hour, forget about everything and relax with a nice massage...  so, for that reason I can’t recommend her.  But if you like that sort of thing then give her a try.

My experience/comments :

I finished up uni early and decided to make my first visit to LMH at 3pm. Walk in as I did not call and book. I parked in the nearby Bunnings rather then the car park there. Greated by a cute asian receptionist who saw me to a room to undress and lie down. Only charged me $60 as I said I saw an promo on locanto. A very busty slim Noel (I think) came in and said hello. Rather then receive a mediocre massage and only get the fun at the end, I asked her straight out if I could receive a sexy massage with lots of teasing. Damage was $50 with HJ. Amazing massage, this girl knew how to tease with plenty of tickling and solid grabs included. On the flip she spent a good 10min just teasing me before offering to let me cum on her tits for another $20. I should've said yes, but did not have the cash with me so settled for a regular but very enjoyable finish. Unfortunately I haven't had the chance to go back yet as I've been away.

My experience/comments : Went for a massage thinking I would try somewhere a little closer to home. There are a few massage joints along this strip of shops and once of them is a little too conspicuous so thought i would try another. 

Total fail....nothing on offer other than straight massage. Cute girl with excellent skill but nothing else available. 

Oh well could be worse still had a decent rub.

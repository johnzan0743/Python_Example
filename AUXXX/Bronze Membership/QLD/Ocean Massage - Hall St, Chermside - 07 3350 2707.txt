My experience/comments : 

Dori was very pretty. Skimpy shorts and nice singlet top. I arrived looking for a RNT nude with light touching. I'm always a gentleman!! 
Dori is a Chinese girl studying here. Basic relief cost me $40.   Should've asked for a finishing guarantee or money back. LOL

Room was clean and dark, aircon and soft music. Very well setup. Shower facility is very tidy and pretty new. 

Her massage was confident and pretty good. I wouldn't go there to solve a muscle issue but as massages from RNTd go you could do a lot worse. 

When we got to the end I asked for extras and we had the typical discussion on what she would offer. Nude no touching with hand relief started at $100 on top of the $65 I'd paid for the massage. Wow! Expensive. I got her down to $85 but that was it. 

Needless to say I went for the basic clothed tug and couldn't finish. She was very disinterested!!

I've been there a few times now and it's a lottery as to what you get. Think I'll stick to the PWGs. At least u know what you're gonna get and RNTs have gotten expensive. Way too expensive even though the girls are pretty. Prices vary from girl to girl. It's a coin toss as to what you'll get.
I have had brilliant service here before at a fair price but the girls seem to change very often.

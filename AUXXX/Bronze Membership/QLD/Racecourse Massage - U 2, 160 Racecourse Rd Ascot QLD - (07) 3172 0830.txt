My experience/comments : Walked up to this place with the missus just looking for a normal massage.  It's in one of those outdoor shopping villages with a carpark, but all the other shops had closed down.  Paid up front (EFTPOS) but knew I was in for some fun when the massage lady stepped out from behind the counter... in a miniskirt!  They were on to me too - they took my missus went to one end of the shop and I went to the other.  I stripped nude and enjoyed an OK massage... I think she was trying harder to rub her crotch on my hand than actually massaging me!  I was fine with that and made sure she could see my rock solid member by spreading my legs.  She rolled me over and I knew it was a sure thing (since when do you roll over for a normal half hour massage!).  She finished me off in good time as to not arouse suspicion with the missus. I'd go again if I'm up that way!

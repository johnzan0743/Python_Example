Value for money/recommend? : Yes, Yaya did a great job.

My experience/comments : Tried this out since it was open late. The set up is professional and clean with tables only separated by a curtain. I took the $50 special which included oil. Yaya is overweight but pretty and very strong. She did a great traditional Thai massage. There was a towel over my underwear the entire time and no hint of extras being on offer. Great if you are in the area and have a sore back. Not a rub and tug place.

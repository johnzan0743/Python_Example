My experience/comments : Just finished some golf at the driving range and noticed there was a new beauty spa that had just opened with massage. They were having a promotion so I thought I'd have a go. The owner/service provider's name is Jina. She was friendly and had a great smile. Her English is not bad, not the best but it was easy to talk to her. It seems this place is mostly geared toward female clientele but she had no issues getting me in for a massage. I was able to take a shower first and took all my clothes off including my underwear and laid down on the table. She covered me with a towel but we had a good talk while she did the massage. She is quite strong and did a good job. On the flip I remained covered but I was getting excited and she seemed to notice I had gotten hard. I asked about extras and she played coy in the beginning but eventually negotiated a handjob with her being topless for an extra $80. She has great big natural Asian tits. I really enjoyed them and the handjob was good too and I was all done after a few minutes. The value for the money is not the best but because the place is in the KDV complex and is so convenient and clean, and the service was good I would be going back. I think she may have needed the money from opening the shop since the outfit was much nicer than most massage shops so who knows how long this will last. It is definitely not geared for a R&T shop. So be discrete guys.

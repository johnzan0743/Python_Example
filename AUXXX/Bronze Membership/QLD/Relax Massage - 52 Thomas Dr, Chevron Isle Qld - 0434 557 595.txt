My experience/comments : Walked in from down the street after not liking the HD girls too much and I saw a sign for Relax Massage. I saw the first Japanese masseuse, and she was quite cute, fit, and wore glasses. They had a room available and I opted for a 30 min massage. The massage was incredible, focused a lot on my back, and legs. Ran her hands and elbows throughout my body and at times even mounted on me to get to the tricky spots. After about 25-30 minutes, she asked if I wanted more for $20. I said yes and she told me she would get someone else to help me. A hot petite Japanese girl walked in (Jo) and we she had cold hands but soon warmed up as she kept rubbing my back and started to tickle my nether regions. Then she told me to flip and the magic started to happen and it was over not long after. She said she also would go nude and you can touch for an extra $30 but I did not opt for that. Overall a good experience for the money!

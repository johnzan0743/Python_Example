My experience/comments : I had the itch & the urge to scratch it. This place was nearby so I thought I would give it a try. Entered the reception area where the financials took place. Was then led to the room. A real room with proper door etc. This venue is just an old queenslander, so the walls are all VJ etc.  At my request received a massage with minimum oil. The massage itself was not bad. On the flip the additional options we explained one pineapple for the top, 2 for the bottom. 
Only complaint was it appears she was the only one there, and had to answer a call once.

Very friendly girl who was not afraid to get up close & personal. Her english was excellent.

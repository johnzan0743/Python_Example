My experience/comments : Went there mainly for a massage as had lower back pains and friend wanted happy ending so settled for this place. The massage itself was very very good, good amount of strength and lots of care. When she flipped me around to do my front, asked if i wanted extra services. I asked how much? she said $20 so i accepted. One of the best massages I have got with a lot of effort put in to make me feel good. Only downside was the girl was maybe a 6/10 in terms of looks.

My friends experience was with a much better looking girl, i saw her as well i'd rate her a solid 8/10 however, her massage was very average apparently, no strength and originally asked for $50 for Hand relief however he bargained to $20 for  a clothed HJ.

My experience/comments :

Ok, so we all like a punt, but there is something about not knowing that gets me every time.
I was loitering Brisbane CBD and came across this place with no research. It looks very legit and I thought I'd check it out. One step inside and I realise that I may not get the excitement I'm looking for but I like a punt! This place was extremely nice and clean with soft music. I requested an hour and was shown to the room. I was asked to remove my clothes and leave the underwear on....I thought....hmmm I'm gonna give this a go so I removed everything. BIG mistake.....ML walks in and sees me naked on the table and mutters something and walks out.....she comes back and starts making a bit of a deal about it so I pulled the shorts on to ease the tension. This was a bugger as the shorts now inhibit what was to turn out to be one of the best legit massages I've ever had. This was a proper Thai style massage that ended with lots of stretching and I now see why the ML was a little stressed to see me naked. When asked to turn over on my back the stretches ended up with my ankles behind my head with my arse in the air.....imagine that naked   Anyway, if you're after a great massage in Brisbane and you're not looking for extras then I would recommend this place.

My experience/comments : This place opened up recently not too far from me and although I had an inkling it was legit massage only, but was in need of a good massage anyway, so TOFTT and checked it out. 
Very clean, very new inside with a typical Thai feel to it. Was lead to the room which was very comfy, left to undress. Was travelling commando so a quick strip off and on to the table. Boom came in and made a remark about no underwear (yep, it's legit), and covered me. The next hour was a sensational Thai deep tissue massage, first without oil then with oil. Worked hard on my lower back down to the glutes and up to shoulders. I remained covered and there was no hint of tackle brushes. So I just relaxed and enjoyed a very good massage. There was a flip, and Boom stood behind a sheet so as not to see anything!! Bottom line, if you're in need of a damn good massage, yep, but zero expectation of anything else.

I prefer their sister shop the famous Thai Aaah Soul Massage.

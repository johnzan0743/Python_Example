My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

After ringing the door bell was greeted by the mamasan who is easily in her 50s maybe 60s, was hoping it was not her who was doing the massage and luckily it wasn't.  Went upstairs to meet Vivian who I think was the only ML working at the time.  Place was very dark so couldn't see that well but from what I could see she was quite pretty.

The massage wasn't even a massage really, more of a tease as she knew the reason why I was there.  After about 10 mins she said $50 for nude HJ?  I said sure, she quickly disrobed displaying a nice rack with perky nipples.  For some reason even though she was pretty, she didn't light my fire, or maybe I was too stressed that day but I asked for FS anyway and she said sure, another $50.  FS was quite good as she was quite enthusiastic and made all the right sounds at the right time.  I won't go into further details but it seems like pretty much anything is on offer here as long as you're willing to pay the price. $150 all up for 30 ~40 mins

I paid for 30mins but I'm fairly certain my session exceeded that - perhaps 40mins in total.  I paid $50 to the mamasan and $100 to the ML, so $150 in total.  I reckon more experienced punters might be able to bring the price down a bit as I'm still new to this.

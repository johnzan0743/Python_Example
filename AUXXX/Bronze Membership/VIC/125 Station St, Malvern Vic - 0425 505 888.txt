Person's Name : Hannah

Establishment : Malvern Massage Therapy Center

Date of Visit : September

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business : 10am-8pm

Rates : $65 + tip

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : average

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean 

Services Provided : massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : perhaps

My experience/comments : Arrived near closing time and they were about to shut shop - looks like they usually close early if no-one's around. Anyway, it's a small place (3 rooms) and I was ushered into one. The girl was fairly average on all fronts, cute in a nerdy sort of way (whatever that may mean!). She was in t-shirt and cut-off jeans. Massage was fair..she was doing her best...her English was enough for a decent conversation as well. Upon the flip it was straight to the main event...no price was ever mentioned. Very good at pacing - was able to caress her thighs while the deed was being done. Tipped her $35 in the end. She said she worked in Oakleigh as well. Also worth noting that the boss of this one (and Oakleigh) has strictly forbidden anything more than HJs.

Hi hilo123m, how did you stay for? 30min? or 60mins? The $65 deal may include a 20mins massage and happy ending. Maybe the girl just wanted go home, so she gave you a HJ without offering.

Hi au2cn, it was for an hour...actually went overtime as she was rather chatty (most likely coz she didn't have many customers that day).

Person's Name : Nancy

Establishment : Malvern Therapy

Date of Visit : 14/01/15

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 125 Station street, Malvern

Hours of Business : 10-8pm

Rates : 30 mins / $50

Age : Mid 20

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Malaysian

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : no

My experience/comments : 
Went there on Wednesday afternoon because my favorite place is busy. Nancy was good and her massage is excellent, we chatted a lot and her English is very good. There was no sign of that even though the massage is quite sensual. In the end I asked her if she provided extra she said NO. Then she went out and asked her college if she want to do it for me. The other girl I don't remember her name came in, she looks average and the tug was too clinical, costing me $40 and no touching. I won't go back.

Person's Name : Mini / Mimi?

Establishment : Malvern Natural Therapy Center

Date of Visit : March 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 125 Station St

Hours of Business : 10am-8pm

Rates : $65 hr + extra

Age : mid 20s?

Size/shape : average

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean

Services Provided : massage, hj, 

Value for money/recommend? : not really

My experience/comments : Having visited in the past I thought I would go again to see how it is going. Two were sitting at the desk, each playing with their phones. Didn't seem like they knew each other. Anyway, led to a darkish room - usual setup with a dim light in the corner. Went for the hour hoping I'd get a half decent massage. So, face down in my birthday suit, the girl begins with the usual questions. Opting for medium, the massage began well enough. Points for enthusiasm...points deducted for no idea..!
The flip was rather early...she kept caressing my inner thighs and taking quick glances towards me to see if I would respond...the little fella started responding anyway...the hj was not the most enjoyable..more like trying to dash to the finish. Her back was turned towards me and she was furiously trying to get me over the line... rather unpleasant. There was a good 10-15 left over but the massage wasn't worth it...!

Maybe a local can check what it really is, also whether it is on a corner and has two street addresses. Where does it advertise?

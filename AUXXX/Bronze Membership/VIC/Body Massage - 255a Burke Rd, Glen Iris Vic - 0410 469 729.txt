I to planned to go there today. Made a phone call to see who was working, looking in hope for Yoyo. Spoke to an Asian male who said that Yoyo was not working today but we have a new girl. I booked a time for later in the morning. Low and behold, got a return phone call from same asian male who told me not to come as the girl would not be there but she would be there tomorrow being Saturday. As I was heading in that direction I drove passed and as 8pmmp8 says it was locked up tight. If I eventually get to see Yoyo I will report. Wollee out.

Gents, 
255A Buke Rd Glen Iris is no longer !!
Dropped into the premises via the very dangerous back stairs to be met by papasan who says we closed. Went inside and the rooms are stripped bare. No tables, chairs, mirrors ...NOTHING.
He said you go to:- 
198 Whitehorse Rd Balwyn Tel 0401 866 801 name given.... Linda.
Was not in the position to drive all the way to Balwyn but will keep for future reference.
Had a couple of good punts here...sad Wol...:

Value for money/recommend? : No / Once off

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

I have always driven past this place and wondered what was going on behind closed doors. It looks like an upmarket massage parlour with no dodgy looking flashing open sign. It is highly secure with buzzer to get in. I had tried one time to walk in off the street but they were too busy so recently I called again on my way home from the city and managed to get a 30min slot. I wasn't keen on trying for more time with no reviews on this place and it is quite costly for massage considering there are reputable places nearby that offer excellent massage (but no extras). 

I arrived and and was greeted by Summer who is a young pretty Thai girl who now lives here in a Melb full time. She speaks English well and had little issue striking up small talk. She led me to a room where a double bed mattress was lying on the floor. Similar set up to that of Miss Nora Thai on a Bridge Rd, Richmond (it wouldn't surprise me if they are owned by the same people, same prices and similar set up). I digress. 

I quickly strip trip off and lay face down on the mattress. Summer returns and lays the towel over my entire body and gives me a once over with her hands and knees up and down the body in typical Thai massage fashion. Once she has adequately warmed up my muscles she whips the towel off my body with some gusto and I hear it hit the wall to my right. I was a bit taken aback and not sure if I should ask for extras right now. Lol. I patiently wait and she oils me up and massages the length of my back and legs and paid great attention to my butt and backs of my thighs. There was no hint of teasing at this point, no touching of the balls or anything so I was still a bit unsure where this may proceed. 

The massage offered by Summer was light at best to my rear, and I mean light massage, I would not recommend this place for quality massage if that is what you are after. Her technique was okay and felt nice but it was merely a relaxation massage that did nothing for me. After 15 mins of relaxation she asked me to flip availing her eyes with the towel as I turned. She then covered me with the towel again and started the invigorate the muscles in my legs but this time it didn't last long. She whipped that towel off quicker than I could blink and started covering me with oil along my thighs and up to my stomach. This time her hands proceeding up and along my groin with deliberate brushes of my tackle. As my cock slowly grew before her eyes, she slid over to my side and straighter it up so that my erection was now growing up towards my stomach. We both looked at one another and she asked if I was alright and if this is what I would like. I barely had a chance to respond before her hands had taken up my length and had started to massage it. While she was working away she was happy for me to touch her. Her body was really tight. Perfect perky little ass that I'd love to see nude and nice little breasts. But it was a clothed HJ. I had immediately wondered if she thought I was a regular as there was no bartering as to cost of extras. At the cost of the massage the extras should well be included but I figured they wouldn't be and I'd be stung with a bill at the end. 

Her HJ technique was okay but she did seem to want to get to the end quickly rather than savoring the moment. I had to try and get her to slow a bit as I touched her, she did not shy away from making eye contact with me, which eventually brought me to orgasm. She offered me a shower or hot towel wipe down. As I dressed I offered her all the cash I had on me which was $30. She said that they usually charge $50 for that and I simply apologized as I was unaware. She simply smiled and said that I'd have to come and see her more often. I would but I'm afraid at $100 for 30mins is a bit steep for clothed HJ. There are girls offering bodyslide for less.

Agree ichiro. Not too concerned about the massage but really $50 for a clothed HJ? More money than brains.

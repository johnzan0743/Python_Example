My experience/comments :  

I've been to this place a few times over the last year, I like that it is clean and they have a shower available.  There is not usually many girls working, the most I have seen is two.  I went down later on a Thursday afternoon and it was very busy.  In the hour I was there about 6 guys came and went.

Sarah is a small girl from Vietnam who is 24 I think.  She is not bad looking and has a decent body but is not keen on any touching other than lightly over clothing.  Her massage is very good, better than most places.  Even without the finish it is a worthwhile massage.

After the flip she offers the happy ending, $30.  No other extras, no topless etc.  Can touch but only on backside and no breasts/groin.  Her technique was good but she does feel like she is going through the motions a bit.

I finish and instead of taking a shower she does a wipe down.  There are just too many punters around to walk to the shower half naked.

This shop is down a lane way behind the supermarket. I had seen it once ages ago. It was only today I remembered it was there and decided to call in. My first impressions of this place was that it was really dark. I could hardly see in reception at all. Rihana had to show me the price details on the counter. After agreeing on a time she led me into the room to get changed. The massage was smooth and pleasant and as mentioned earlier, an enjoyable conversation. I mentioned that it was unusual to find a non-Chinese massage shop in the area. She mentioned there was anotherone but she wasnt sure where. We agree on extra Hj. I flipped over. He Hj action was kinda strange, all the action was on my shaft. I dont think she touched my knob at all. Regardless she was very effective. She stayed in the room afterwards, changing the towels. Notably, before fitting fresh towels she sprayed the table and the shelves with a cleaner and wiped them down. When I was leaving she gave me a hug. The reception was was still almost totally dark.

My experience/comments : This parlour is difficult to miss on High Street Road, Mt Waverley with a 24 hour massive neon sign flashing "MASSAGE". I walked in in the late afternoon and was greeted by Kimmy, small slim and lanky Asian. Plain looking. Elected for $50 30 min massage.

Kimmy did a decent massage with not too much oil but she doesn't tease very much unfortunately. Immediately after the flip she offered $50 for HJ and $100 for body slide. I declined the body slide and she discounted to $80 which I decided to try.

Her body slide is disappointing because essentially she just rubs her small tits over you without letting you have a feel for what's down under. The experience was redeemed somewhat by the Spanish. All in all an okay experience. 

WIR? Probably not

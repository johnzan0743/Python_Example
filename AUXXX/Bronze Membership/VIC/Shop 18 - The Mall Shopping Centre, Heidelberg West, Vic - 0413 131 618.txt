This a new shop run by Anna that has the one round the corner on Bell Street and Station St, Fairfield. The girls do a good job, a clean place and always pantyhose.
Happy punting...

Just to warn this is more of rant than review. 

has anyone encountered with the older mamasan in her 50s? Please don't tell me she is the owner. 

I normally see with the younger mamasan at her early 30s. Granted, i only been here few times with one review on bell st but has always see her in the shops (bell st and the mall), she was a nice lady and easy to converse with her. 

I went in earlier tonight, the old mamasan was on the phone speaking in her native language and asked me to come in. I asked how long till next available girl, she said 3-5 mins. Then someone called to book for 1/2 hr, i could hear her took the booking. and i've been sitting down for 5 mins or so. She came to me and asked how long do i want, i said 1/2 hr. She said someone just booked and the next available is in 25 mins. I told her but you said few mins, how come now 25 mins? She told me to go to bell st shop, there are 3 nice girls available darling. I told her no, i'll just come back next time if I've got time, I don't appreciate being mess around like this. 

Why take a booking when you've got a patron waiting in the shop. furthermore, Who knows other shop has 3 girls available? for all i know, i could be the idiot heading down there with even bluer balls without the relieve. If she told me earlier, i could just head down to bell st or fairfield. Poor form this lady.

never had that issues with her once mate, im sure it happens more and more now that she is trying to run all 3 at the same time. She defiantly  should not have done that, but i think she was thinking she would just send you down to the 300 bell. my guess is that someone would have been free for sure. Since the Mall opened 300 bell is used far less now. Who were you looking to book when you arrived anyway. it doesn't sound like you care who you booked?

That's poor form and a real pet hate of mine.A booking is a booking and there is no lower form of punting life than a grub who knowingly steals someone else's booking.If you can't be bothered with the courtesy of making a booking what makes you think you can just turn up and get who or what you want in front of someone else?
As for the owner of the business,she should remember that a "VIP" (whatever the hell that is) was a new customer once so why put one before the other?I would have thought a business of this nature would have been concerned with keeping as many customers on side as possible because it only takes one phone call from someone she has pissed off.

I have to agree with most if not all of what Toomuchtime has to say. Apart from what appears to be a veiled threat. 
Courtesy is I think a reasonable thing when punting. We should understand how it feels to have your lady pulled out from under you when you in the middle of a punt. Personally I would walk and ask for my money back.
I know Anna when enough to get that treatment but I wouldn't. 
I can either wait for my turn when it's all said and done I have never been that desperate for tug that I need to spoil another persons fun.
Anna on the other hand should know better, a bird in the hand so to speak and if she had others available she should have referred her VIP to the best of them. 
She doesn't piss off too many if any, in 12 pages of reviews and comments I doubt there is another criticizing her professionalism.

TMT.... 
easy to run ur mouth on a forum... 

but it isnt my fault that if I call or get there and ask for a type she does the switch... I have also been f'd around from Anna a few times too... bouncing from shop to shop to find no1 free or being told "that" girl is there when she isnt. so I also know how it feels to wait around etc... 

dont make this a personal thing, as I have no beef with any of you boys... 
we are all here to play in the same sea with different fish. .. 

happy punting fellas!

With due respect Random your previous post was more a gloat and it sounded personal when you indicated you had almost a priority by taking girls out of existing bookings. 
If that's not what it was please accept my apologies but if you reread it you may get the same impression. 
I agree we are to play in the same sea and sometimes with the same fish so it is unfair to take a fishermans catch albeit a catch and release.

In response to the responses to my post of a few days ago.
THA-There was definitely no intention to make a veiled threat,simply pointing out a potential consequence of pissing off the wrong customer.I have visited this shop in the past and received nothing but good service from them.
JAR-As others have pointed out,your post did seem gloating and my post was in response to what I too perceived as gloating.Personally,if I turned up to a shop and the owner wanted to pull a girl out of someone else's booking in order to accommodate me,I would decline and come back another time.I wouldn't want it happening to me so I wouldn't allow it to happen to someone else,regardless of how toey I was.

All good.

As long as shes got great girls working for her and keep the low price, punters would consistently be coming to the shop. That is unless new and better comps emerged, none around the area to my knowledge, apart from that parlour near maccas.

As for me, I'd like to believe she was having an off night on my last visit, but i wouldn't go back anytime soon. I just don't like to be stuffed around, especially knowing that my time could be given away to a simple phone booking.

Id say the roster for these girls changes on a daily basis so i dont think you can ever really know when one girl will be working at either 3 of the venues, just call up and ask where she is. anytime i call i just ask for the girl im after and which shop she is at on that day

She also has the shop in Station St/Albert St (not sure where it changes) so the girl of your choice could be there too. When I saw Emily she told me that if I came in & she was at another shop they would ring & get her to come to the Mall. Going from everyone's responses it sounds like I'd have to go to her. In saying that I never request any particular girl I prefer to get whoever is free, you never know when you'll get the best you've had!

Dropped in today and asked the pappasan for Donna - he said she wasn't in and recommended Kim Mei, suggesting her massage was very good. 

Took the punt and had a fantastic massage. Asked for a strong massage and it was good with elbows and hitting the right spots. I was surprised when she got out the hot stones, too. As good as some "proper" masseuses i've been with. 

Was $60+$20 for the hour and an average tug; but I'd go again just for the massage.

 Massage on the mall
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Ming & Jessica

Establishment : Massage on the mall 

Date of Visit : 30/9/14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 1B - The Mall Shopping Centre, Heidelberg West, 0413131618

Hours of Business : 7 days 10am -8pm

Rates : $60 30mins for double $30 for extras

Age : Early 20s

Size/shape : Slim & petite

Nationality or Ethnicity : Vietnamese

Services Provided : Massage & HJ

Value for money/recommend? : no, will not return

My experience/comments : 
I was in Heidelberg so i rocked up around 7.30pm and the young Vietnamese dude told to wait 5mins so i sat down on the couch and watched dancing with the stars until 2 attractive girls finished with their customer and walked out of a room. The young Vietnamese dude asked if i wanted 2 girls and i said yes for 30mins and paid him $60 and he showed me to my room. Jessica and Ming came in and while i was undressing and told me to lie down after the introduction and then started the massage which in was below average. They were talking amongst themselves allot and their hands didn't go anywhere near crack or balls. Jessica asked me to turn over and when i did she asked if i want extra for $30 and i agreed. Jessica oiled me up and started mechanically jerking my limp dick straight away while Ming started rubbing my thigh and nipple a bit. Because there was no attempt at arousing me before she went straight into a mechanical HJ i only managed a semi hard with no luck in the end. My 2 girl massage was a big flop.

Same here gspa300, I had a double at this place with Jessica and Rita and I also felt it way below par for this place, no lead up to the hj, hard to get aroused when its a mechanical flip and jerk scenario. I would give the shop another try, but get a massage with one girl. With my double I ended up kicking Jessica out and had Rita finish me of on her own. Two girls sounds great and it is when both are focused on you (I've had a great double in the past). Talking shop amongst themselves that's not a turn on it's just boring, incidentally I mentioned this to the papasan and he gave me a $20 refund.

With the greatest respect for anyone who visits this place a word of advise if I may be so bold.

The owner here is absolutely rigid on the amount that the girls can accept as a tip. So also reads forums.
A $20 tip is all they are permitted to take and if girls are caught taking more they are dismissed.
Any extra service would also result in the same.

So unless you want your girl sacked then perhaps discretion is the way to go. 
She now has 4 venues and all provide the same service at the same prices.
Perhaps I might suggest that because she runs such a clean business that she is left alone by the authorities.

Just an observation.

You could visit every day for a year and it wouldn't do you any good buddy.A $20 tug is all you will ever get there unless the house changes the price for the tug.

Absolutely agree with Toomuchtime, I've had a couple of chats to the owner when she only had the original store in WHberg and she was always very clear to me about the boundaries she put in place for her girls and what was allowed not allowed from them, she seemed confident that this would assist with drawing less attention to the shop although now that we have expanded out to 4 outlets not so sure!

Has anyone tried Jessica in this venue recently? Is she still working there.

I thought she just did some breast enhancement and some dyeing on her hair as well (yellow - brown). She's quite short, around 30-32, got skinny legs without the high heel (probably 5.1 feet)

If anyone tried her just recently please tell me how's her service. Please pm me because I'd have some very interesting information to share about her.

Thanks a ton !

Passed by here a few days ago. There is a new phone number, and a small illuminated sign above the door saying 'Phoenix'. Called the number and it seems this place is under new management, as the young lady on the phone said she only owns this one store. Might TOFTT and see what's changed, for better or worse.

My experience/comments : 
Popped into WJ for an off the cuff massage.
Has been the same ladies there for the past 12 months or more. Have gotten friendly with the owner/manager (really nice person, but also has a sting in her tail if you try and wrong her)
Anyways, I was asked if I wanted to see the new masseuse, and I was like sure as long as she has good skills. I was assured that I wouldn't be disappointing.
Shown to the room and she gets down to business. Very good massage top to toe, with a little bit of play to make it all interesting and to let you know that she knows what the 411 is!
After a few sack tickles she apologies for her hand..... "it's being very cheeky" she says.
I laugh and reply with some quick witted quip that gets me a smack on the arse.
Time for the flip and the drape comes off and she is looking at me with a half shy look. We discuss $$ and she agrees on $50 for nude hj (can only touch bum and boobs)
She strips off, revealing an nice smooth firm arse and (IMO) a delicious pair of perky young natural boobs, c cup.
With a nice play from both parties we are done.
Hot towel clean up and I am out the door.
Lovely girl with a value for money service.
I'll will try and see her again for sure.

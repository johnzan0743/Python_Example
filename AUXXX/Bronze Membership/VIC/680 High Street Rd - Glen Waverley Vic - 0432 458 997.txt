My experience/comments :

I drive through this place every day but never noticed before. When I was looking for a place close to Glen I saw this ad in Locanto. Ad promises a lot but women are not for me. When I reach there they both were free. Both in late 30's or early 40's. Not lookers but not bad body types for the age. The one with bigger boobs came to serve me. Just $50 for half hr. Room was not bad and was pretty clean as well. Door has a glass bit so can see through but no clear glasses. No real roof so you can here talking and walking from outside. Any way face down on the table and started with a very average massage. She may has skills but focused on more tickling and ball touching to make me go for some extra. She had very bad English so couldn't communicate well. In the meantime a new customer started his session next room with the second lady and could hear every single word and noise. He looked to me a regular and sounded like they were up to extras right away. That woman sounded like they are in FS session. Anyway, it was my first visit and couldnâ€™t communicate with my lady properly so i ended up with a HJ only. It was good and she used lots of oil though. I am sure that she would do more as well.
Hot towel cleaning and I am ready to leave. I heard from outside two women talked in Chinese and second lady came out of her session and asked me to come back and be with her next time to get more extras. I might visit to see her again. Overall not bad. Yeah, gave $30 for HJ.

There is a universal mime that might help when normal communication doesn't work.

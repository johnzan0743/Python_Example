My experience/comments : 
Had been here once before & had a cutie give an average massage with a really nice tug so I figured would try again. No appointment, just rocked up, 5 min's wait & I was in. Olivia came in & she was a real cutie. Really nice, good english & looked great. Place appears to be legit but the girls are accommodating.
I was stripped & lying face down and she asks how I like, I say medium to hard. What followed was a great massage, really strong & hit all the spots even focusing on the tender areas. Not the best I've had but definitely worthwhile. I forgot to mention, she left me uncovered, no towel, just starkers on the table which is always a great sign. 
As she starts getting up to the inner thighs, I spread my legs a bit more to allow plenty of access to which she obliges. Rubbing the legs with a good amount of attention to the crack & sack. 
On the flip, soldier is standing at attention, without a word she starts a really good HJ, again plenty of crack & sack. She'd build me up then calm me down & it was great, she knew how to prolong it. After a few minutes I just gave in & let it go. She cleaned up with tissues & wipes then gave me a sensational head & face massage where I think I fell asleep. Then she finished up, wiped me front & back with a warm towel, thanked me & left the room. 
Up to this time, she hadn't asked for any tip so on the way out she offered me a bottle of water which I gratefully accepted & slipped her $30 (which is what I paid last time) & thanked her again. She works Mondays & Fridays, but last Friday I called & was told she wasn't working that day so I'll have to try again tomorrow maybe. I know you can get more for that money at other establishments but sometimes a really good massage & HJ from a cute little honey is just what you need.

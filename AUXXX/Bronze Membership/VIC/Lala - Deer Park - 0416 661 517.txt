My experience/comments : After a long day, I needed a massage to unwind and relax. Drove down to this place that's been there for a few years. Walk in and am greeted by a reasonably attractive asian masseuse. Shows me into the room and asks me to undress and jump onto the table. Her English is poor so communication is pretty difficult. Nude up and jump on the table, after a couple of minutes she comes back in and starts the worst massage ever using a lotion. There was absolutely no pressure at all it was more of a tickle. This went on for 5 minutes and then she asked me to turn over. I turned over and started thinking this is shit and I just want to leave. More of the same tickle to the point I asked how much for a tug, she signaled a bj but I said no handjob. She asked for $50. Being tired and cbf kicked in so I agreed. She took her dress off showing a nice set of tits probably a b cup but wouldn't take off her panties. Started the tub like a jack hammer and started making these bullshit moaning noises. As soon as a blew my load, she stopped cleaned her hands, put her dress on and walked out to get a bucked of water to clean me up. At this point I'm thinking I've wasted my money. She came back and cleaned me up. With 10 minutes to spare being a gentleman I said thank you Im done got dressed and left. This was this first punt I've had at an asian massage place and probably wont be going to another one for a while.

Not being racist but avoid these Asian women at all cost. They can't speak English, bad vibes, they don't know how to give a proper HJ, and they don't know how to give massages. 

I stopped going to asian massage parlors long ago because after every experience i felt like never going back for a RNT.

You may be onto something with the " no speak english" aspect.   You cannot build a rapport with a customer without good communication.

I agree that when they can't speak English it will probably be a poor experience, whether Asian or Non Asian.

However, I have had some fantastic experiences with MLs whose English was not very good. Again, both Asian & Non Asian.

Sorry to hear about your bad experiences, but sounds like you go to the wrong places, my experience, in the majority of cases, is completely opposite to yours.

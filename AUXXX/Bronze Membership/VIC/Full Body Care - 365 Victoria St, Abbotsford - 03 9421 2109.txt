[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments : Had a big day of drinking and was stumbling through richmond when I came across this place. Wasn't looking for a R&T but $30 for 30 mins sounded enticing.

The woman who massaged me was horrible looking ... very overweight and had makeup on that made her look like a drag queen. I almost left instantly but decided "oh well, its only $30"

Massage was average at best, but she did focus a lot on the inner thighs !

Asked me to turn over and said its $20 extra for a happy ending, so i closed my eyes and let her finish me off ! 

If you want a cheap massage from a very average looking woman .. you may like this place[/COLOR]

 Anna - Ping's Full Body Care, 365 Victoria Street Richmond -  9421 2109
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Anna

Establishment : 365 Victoria St, Richmond

Date of Visit : 19/07/17

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 365 Victoria St, Richmond - 03 9421 2109

Hours of Business : 10am - late

Rates : 30min/30, 60min/60, Extras: HJ $20, BJ $30, Sex $50

Age : 30..ish

Size/shape : 7 ... enhanced C cups...GREAT BJ!!

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : HJ/BJ/Sex

Value for money/recommend? : YES!! I almost visit her every week!

My experience/comments : I have been to this place for several times, my favorite-lady was Jenny but her left, now I found Anna who does the same level service as Jenny, so I'm so addicted to her

Normally these nude massage shop is only for a quick hand relief, but I will pay Anna $80 for a good decent 30 minutes BJ work, that's for a good reason:

Anna has a size 7 body, enhanced C-D cup with tiny nipples, body still in good sharp.  Her age should be 30-35, not speaking good English but can talk the basic, my normal 30min session is always like this:

I greeting her, pay $80 for the 30min session and then lay on the bed, naked.

She comes back in, take dress off, only panties on.

She cleans my little 'Dildo' with wiper and put condom on.

And she starts to suck my dildo, hard/soft/hard

In the meantime, I will finger her wet pussy, yes i always do that, and play her tits, hard

She will blow me till cum for almost 20min (that's why i ask her don't suck to hard, i don't want that quick).

One time i want to fuck to cum, thus pay another $20 to lay her down.

She is my favorite lady so far.

I will keep visiting her.

Don't try others, they are bad!!

Ok, thanks for the info. I walked past here from the other side of Victoria st last week on my way to the other Pings to see Kelly, saw that it looked very quiet, thought maybe closed. Was going to check it out but no need to bother now.

Sad to see it close down.
I hope LE not involved.

It was as cheap as chips. More miss than hit, but the occasional gem. 

Geez Jersey, I hope Kelly is safe. 
She is a good scout. and is my 'any port in a storm' standby.

No worries pancho Kelly was in fine form.
That was my first encounter with her after reading many reviews and as you say, for an any port in a storm option, $30 all up for a HJ is not too bad in my opinion.

How about sharing with a review? That's what we are here for right? You have commented on how good Kelly is 3 or 4 times but I can't find your review of her.

Hi Nextlife

My last review of Kelly was 03/06/2017.
https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f353/...ria#post262860

It can be a bit confusing. Two shops, same name, same street, same vicinity.

These days Kelly's shop at 250 Victoria Street Abbotsford is simply called Body Care.

The other Pings Body Care at 365 Victoria Street Abbotsford is now closed. 

There is also confusion whether the suburb is Abbotsford or Richmond. LOL

Cheers
Pancho

If you click on the link provided & scroll upwards you should find it.
I remember I had difficulties with the site around this time, and I was not being credited with having submitted some of my reviews.
The site is working a treat these days though.

Pancho I may be wrong but I am pretty sure the Pings at 365b Victoria st is Abbottsford because of the side of the street it is on. Pings 250 Victoria st is on the other side so it is in the Richmond zone. I think Victoria st must be the boundary between Abbostford and Richmond. But I agree it can be confusing. When I first met Alice in Preston she gave me the address as 365b Victoria st Richmond but when I punched it into my google maps it kept coming up as Abbottsford. Easier now only 250 Victoria st Richmond left out of the 2.

It has re-opened closer to Hoddle Street, same side of the road.   Near the railway overpass.

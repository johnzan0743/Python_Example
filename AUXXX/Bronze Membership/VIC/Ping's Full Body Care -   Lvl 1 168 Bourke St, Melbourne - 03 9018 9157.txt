My experience/comments : 


Went up stairs to mini arcade turn left.


Kim comes out, we agree 30mins for $30.


Kim is forty plus but nice and thin, she always wears tights, to show off her slim legs. 


I ignore the sign to keep underwear on, and nude up, I lie down with cock between legs.


Kim comes back and whispers, "soft darling" yes I say.


She starts at the top of the table with her upper thighs touching my hands, I grope for pussy but cannot discern the topology.


She gets to the butt very soon, expert butt work, and I bone up.


She notices this and says "Ummmm happy cock", we laugh together.


Time for flip, I go straight for ass, as I am an ass man, nice to grope, Kim is a thin women so its easy to grope her pussy from behind.


She laughs and says naughty boy, I'm 53. 


I then realise my cock is in her hand, she says $20, I say great.


Expert tug, slow, no hurry, lasted 10mins, as time ran out she adjusted her stroke and I expired.

Value for money/recommend? : not for me

My experience/comments : I've walked past this place a few times and wanted to give it a go and today i did. The entrance is not very discreet so i waited for the right time and went in and straight upstairs. A young attractive girl in shorts came out asked how long i would like to stay which i said 30min and she said $30, so far so good.
Lulu led me to a small room with a curtain and i gave her $50 and she told me to get undressed and she'll be back so i got undressed and hopped on to the table until she came back. When she came back she told me she would bring my change later (which i thought was code for i'm keeping it for the extras). Lulu started the massage which was okay and worked her way down from my back to my legs with no teasing at all. She asked me to turn over while she got a pillow and put it under my head, she then left the room and came back with my $20 change put it on the little table next to my clothes and left the room again. An older women came back inside so i realized the bait and switch had occurred, even though i was upset that hot Lulu in the sexy shorts was not going to finish me off i wasn't to fussed because she was okay looking and thinking she was experienced she would do a better job, i was dead wrong!!! She went strait into it with a mechanical motion which made hard for me to make it over the line but I eventually did. After the clean up she took my $20 change and told me that is for the extra.
Would i recommend? No unless you want a cheap hj massage and the bait and switch.

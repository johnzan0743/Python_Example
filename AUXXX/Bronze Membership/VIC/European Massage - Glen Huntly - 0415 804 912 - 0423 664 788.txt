European Massage - Glen Huntly

European Massage - Glen Huntly

Person's Name : Sasha

Date of Visit : 10th Jan 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 2 Royal Avenue Glen Huntly 0415 804 912

Hours of Business : 10am till 7pm 

Rates : $100 for 60 min 

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : slender with a perfect ass

Nationality or Ethnicity : anglo

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

Called up this place few times last year to find out about the therapists available and it was always an older lady sounded like in her 40s. Tried again in Jan after reading a new Locanto ad for a Sasha. I texted the number at 7pm not really expecting anyone to reply, but I received a call few minutes later. A much younger voice said she was available so I decided to book an hour.
When I arrived, she was by herself in the shop and she was this sweet looking girl with shoulder length dark hair. I had a good look at that tight and bubbly ass when she led me into the room.
The massage itself wasn't great as she failed to go under my body without enough oil. However when I asked her for extras, she quickly agreed and man, that body was exactly what I liked. Very slender but with the right curves in the right place. She has this almost innocent look on her face, but she reacted to every touch I made on her skin. It was an intense explosion in the end and I could tell she thoroughly enjoyed it too.

I called few times afterwards, but she might have left the place as I was told she was on holiday or away. It would be good to know whether she still works.

Person's Name : Kim

Establishment : European Massage

Date of Visit : 11/8/2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 2 Royal Avenue Glen Huntly 0415 804 912

http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_1...EN-HUNTLY.html

Hours of Business : 10 - 8pm

Rates : $60 for 45 mins (plus $50 for HJ)

Age : late twenties

Size/shape : Small/petite

Nationality or Ethnicity : Colombian

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : I texted this establishment prior to arrival just to double check they still do sexy massages. I got a reply within 5 mins and confirmed my appointment. They seem to do male waxing here as well, hence why I had to double check if RnT was still on the menu. I arrived and they had three ladies there Kim, an older Asian lady who seem to run everything and also a hippy looking croatian girl. I booked in for 45 mins and was escorted by Kim to my room. Room was pleasant and warm inside and she offered me a glass of water which was nice.  I accepted and proceeded to get naked and laid on the table. Kim's massage skills were very good, very sensual and I think she could tell I was super horny. She did use a lot of oil, so be prepared for that. There was lots of touching of the hands which I liked and she had a good connection with me. She wasn't afraid to massage the crack either. On the flip, she could see my boner and asked if I wanted extra, I said yes and she said that will be 50. Her handjob skills were top notch and I started touching her to see how she would react, she didn't flinch which was nice and she maintained eye contact all throughout the rub. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely go back.

Person's Name : Cathy (??)

Establishment : Autumn Day Spa

Date of Visit : 08/17

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 2 Royal Ave, Glen Huntly Vic

TELEPHONE: 0423 664 788 

Hours of Business : 10.30am - 8pm

Rates : 30mins / around $50-

Age : 40..ish

Size/shape : 8 ... real D cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : Waxing Trimming / R&T / Maybe more

Value for money/recommend? : Yeh, I'd go back.

I happened to catch sight of my 'George W. Bush' in the mirror the other morning. Fuck'n hell, it looked like Willie Nelson was staring back at me! 

Now I'm currently in love with a gorgeous Bangkok princess who works down at the local AMP and I'm trying to talk her into doing the 'no-pants dance' with me. I've done the no-pants bit and her poontang pie is as smooth as a glazed donut (but quite a bit wetter . Man, I gotta soak my clam-candle in some of that Thai oyster sauce.

So this was a no-brainer. I'd better clean up my act and get my fuckin' undergrowth under control. Don't want to turn her off.

Acting on a tip from a mate who reckons he gets his junk waxed every few weeks, I boogied down to this joint that advertises waxing as well as, you guessed it, relaxation, swedish, deep tissue, 
Thai and hot stone massage. 

I'm met by an Asian MILF, probably somewheres in the forty somethings but not unattractive, dressed professionally in a knee length skirt and a dark top that pretty much completely covered her rack (however, I did note - for future reference - that the zipper which ran down the front, neck to waist, would allow easy access). She carries a little extra weight but definitely not fat. Nice skin. She had a sort of streetwise look to her face that indicated to me she knew how to handle a cock. 

I start asking about waxing but, jeezuss, as I look around the room and spy the side-table with all those instruments of torture straight out of 'Bride of Frankenstein', creams and lotions and what looks like a laser gizmo I start to freak out. So we settle on a trim using electric hair clippers. Don't slip, honey. She wants 30 bucks for the trim so I ask her, up front, if she'll throw in a handjob for 50. I get a sly look but basically it's yeh, no worries 

I strip off and hoist my wang up onto the table. She returns, dons some plastic gloves, rubs some liquid shit over my fuck whiskers (I was having a bad hair day) and then steadies my cock with one hand while she commences shaving with the other. I think she's done this before a few times. The rest of the service basically consisted of her manipulating my cock to the left and right, to the up and down as she worked her way around my crotch and ball bag with the shears. All the while she's happily chatting away about all sorts of shit. I'd obviously booked the stimulus package because pretty soon I had a humongous fat but she didn't blink an eyelid.

Manscaping over, she gives me a rub down with some kind of cleanser which only helped to increase the height of my Woodrow Wilson, removes her gloves and starts a slow, pretty sensual kneading of my meat stick. I'm pretty fired up by now and my python starts thinking for itself. I ask if I can take a look at her cans. Fine, but she wants more money. I up her another 20 and her top is unzipped to reveal a sizeable pair of what I think are probably maybe D-cups. These juggs were real - no plastic here. She swings around and sits on the table, back to me, and asks me to remove her bra. No worries, honey. With her knocker-locker out of the way, she leans her back against me and I reach around with both hands and start massaging her fun bags. All the while she's jerking, stroking, polishing, choking and rubbing my todger. This goes on for a good few minutes. When she senses I'm close she turns and whispers "Let's do this". Standing up she takes a firm grip like only a veteran can and pumps me til I shoot.

Paid up and I'm out the door after promising to come back in a few weeks for a proper waxing session (but my promises are about as useless as a one armed trapeze artist with an itchy arse).

Would I return. Yes, but not for waxing. Get real!

By the way I did ask her name but I'm fucked if I remember. I think it was Cathy (??)

The old number is still active and at the original address. Here is the website - Prices | Autumn Day Spa

Think you might find that newer ad is just using similar wording to hook punters.

Popped into the new European Massage at 521 Glenhuntly Rd. Was a guy sitting at the front desk, which is always a tad off putting for me. Didn't get a great vibe so just asked for prices. $50 for 30mins, $70 for 30 mins Lomi, which he told me was very good, "they do it naked". Anyway, haven't TOFTT yet but will see how i go.

The "old" European (now called Autumn Day Spa) is still in operation opposite the station in Royal Ave. As they state in their ad: Across Glen Huntly station ( NOT on Glen Huntly road). They also helpfully note that they have a rear door. No need to question that "more is on offer there" - as I can attest.

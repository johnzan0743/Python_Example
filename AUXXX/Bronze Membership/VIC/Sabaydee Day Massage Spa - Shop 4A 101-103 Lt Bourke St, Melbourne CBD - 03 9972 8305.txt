My experience/comments : Well I was feeling just right for a nice massage and hopefully an empty session. 

I asked this pretty girl (Janny) for 90 minutes and she says no no no - 60 minutes only and it all looked too hard. I had hoped for the leggy skinny piece in the high heels but Janny was next off the rank.

Well the massage was ordinary but there was a sensual and specific approach with her gently brushing me and then I felt her nails up my ball sack. She was enjoying watching me get excited and then on the flip I could see a little smile and she was quite pretty and easy on the eyes.

She offers extras and I she tells me RnT topless for $50 - I thought it was a little steep - but what the heck. Lovely lingerie under that top and wow what great body hidden under that baggy top - she releases her natural breasts and they are perfect and the leggings she is wearing are so tight and revealing a perfect curvy body. 

She goes to work on me and I get to gently massage her perfect breasts and after she cleaned me up she had those puppies so close I had to kiss and suck them - she loved it and let me massage her sweet sexy body outside the leggings.

I'll be back

My experience/comments : went on Friday after work. Paramount centre has a few massage  choices to pick luckily. My usual place for a weekday. Walked in at around 6.30 and all the ladies were busy so I had to wait a few minutes by myself in one of the partitions. 

Gave her the $40 and she returned after a minute. Asked if I had been there and I said yes. I laid down on my front without any underwear. Mediocre massage with oil (be careful if you need to go back to the office!) she then used her nails to softly massage my upper leg and I was quite hard at that time and knew where this was going. She asked me to flip and wanted $50, I said $30 and that's the price from another lady there so she accepted it. Slow sensual strokes and the build up lasted about 2-3 minutes. Exploded and then she helped me clean up. I still had a bit of oil on my back so asked for another wet towel.

My experience/comments : 

Found this new place after asking one of my regulars.

Pros is that this place is upstairs in the arcade away from the crowd downstairs. Cons is that it is situated right opposite a travel agent who stares as you walk in. Talk about the walk of shame! lol

Anyway the place had 2 ladies on. Reception didnt allow pre-booking inspections of the girl so I just took a punt on coco. 

BIG MISTAKE!

She was not attractive at all, and was biggish in nature. After I made peace with the fact that I could at least try for a decent massage leading to a HJ. Another big mistake. 

Massage was more of a thumb poking and hard rubbing which actually felt painful! It's the kinda "massage" that all punters wish they would never experience. 

Didn't turn me on, was limp, and thanked her 15 minutes into the session. 

Extras might be on offer but I wasn't interested in staying and find out.

Person's Name : Mika

Establishment : HANABI Japanese Therapy

Date of Visit : 22/01/17

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 111/259 Collins St, Melbourne VIC 3000

Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm

Rates : 30mins / 60

Age : 20s

Size/shape : nice size

Nationality or Ethnicity : jap

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : not yet....

My experience/comments :

There's not many places in Melbourne where there are authentic japanese girls for massages. Hanabi, as the name suggests, is one such establishement where there seems to have authentic japs on staff.

Visited and was offered Mika - face was so so but the fact that i could get it on with a jap intrigued me. 

Went in and opted for the 30 min massage and the standard SOP at all establishments. 

Massage was more of a finger poke more than any real pressured massage (seems like the norm at this establishment?), but I must be in a forgiving mood that day as I was happy at the thought of having a jap put her hands on my naked body. 

Disappointingly there were hardly any touches that suggested anything extra was on offer, and as mentioned, I was happy just to be "touched" by a jap. Sure enough the entire session I was on my belly with no chance to fly my flag in the wind. 

On a more positive note, I had a good chat with her on all things jap and just hearing her cute accent was enough to keep me happy. I think there might be more here and I would probably go back to find out more. 

If anything, just the opportunity to get touched again and have a good conversation with a real jap seems to be floating my boat at this time.

Phone : 03 85907642

Hours of Business : 10 - 8pm

Rates : $75 per hour

Age : 28

Size/shape : 6-8 thin fit. Natural B cups. Med length hair

Nationality or Ethnicity : Indonesian

Services Provided : HJ. Topless. Naked. Body slide

Value for money/recommend? : okay

My experience/comments : This place is good for something in the city though the extras are average Melb cBD prices.  On this day i booked Natalie. Seen her from a different shop that is now closed.  She's very friendly has a nice tanned body and can be quite sensual. 
Massage starts off with a good rub and lots of oil. 
On the flip i opt for naked hj. Her prices are $50, $80? $100and $150 for HJ, topless, naked and bodyslide. 
She knows how to make a man horney but she doesn't allow free reign over the session. No FIP and sometimes no DATY claims is only for her boyfriend. Though on occasion ive done both when i got get too excited. But not this day. She can give a great hj with both hands and after a while i cum and the usual clean up ensues.

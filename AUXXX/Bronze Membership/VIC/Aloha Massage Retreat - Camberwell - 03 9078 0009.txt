Date of Visit: 24/01/14

Hours: 10am till late

50 HJ, 70 topless HJ, 100 Full naked with body to body rubbing

Age: ~25

Size - Slim with about D cup 

Nationality - Chinese 

Service : Massage, Spanish, HJ

Recommended - Yes (but expensive)

My experience/Comments:

booked couple days before, walked in, paid 100 to the man at the reception.
he took me to nice room with shower, told me to get undressed and wait.
after 2 minutes the girl came in, started with gentle massage and asked me if I want any extras. 
she explained what's on the menu with the cost (as above). I took the full body pack.
she got undressed, nice body with big tits for Chinese girl. started to rub her body on mine whilst I was face down and touching my balls sometimes.
after a while I turned. she did the same focusing on rubbing her tits on my dick. Also a bit of Vagina rubbing but she was careful not to let me enter.
at some point she turned around sitting on me and did nice HJ.
after I was done, she went into the shower for quick wash. came back and put her panties on. she continued the massage topless.
during all the time, I could touch everywhere but with no penetration.
was very good but I think $200 with no FS is a bit too much.

Yes been there. Very clean and a nice place. Look for my review. But it is pricey. Although you can tick one off the bucket list. I had my first "dark skin" lady. Please no offense, she was very nice and a pleasure to chat to. Had traveled and well educated. Very refreshing. :-)

 Alisha - Aloha massage
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Alisha

Establishment : Aloha massage

Date of Visit : April2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :  www.alohamassageretreat.com.au 

Hours of Business : 10am-10pm

Rates : 100 for the hour

Age : 31

Size/shape : Short, curvy, generous C cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian/ Italian

Services Provided : Massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Have been to this place a few times before and have always had a pretty good outcome, I decided to ring ahead and ask who was on, booked Alisha sight unseen and was quite impressed with her looks and service. All started with a pretty standard massage, inquired about extras and nude with HJ finish was available for an extra 100, bit pricey I know but I believe it is worth it for the quality and comfort of this place. Massage continued (with her now nude) and when it came time for the flip things really started to heat up, Alisha straddled my cock and started to rub her pussy up and down my shaft, felt like it was almost going to FS but no luck, she then jumped off and gave a great HJ with great rhythm, she put her mouth right near my cock blowing lightly  but never committing to a BBBJ, personally I really enjoyed the tease of the whole experience and this was evident in a rather large (and messy) ending that we both had a laugh about, she is a great girl and said she loves her job. Be nice to this one as she is a keeper.

It makes me ill thinking about this shop and there girls laughing there heads off as customers leave.  If we offered them 20$ extra for them to be naked with a hj, they would laugh and have no idea that 5 years ago, that was a fair and acceptable rate in the rnt scene.

True, but that was 5 years ago. Things change. You don't have to pay it if you don't want to.
Would you prefer a great one hour session with someone who enjoys what they do for 200, leaving feeling satisfied. Or a half hour session at a crappy massage place with a girl who doesn't want to be there leaving you feeling as though you could have spent your 70 better elsewhere?
Different strokes for different folkes.

Yeh buts its these folks getting strokes and paying $200 for it that is setting the bench mark and inflating the market place with no need. 

Most "non asian" establishments have already put prices up on the house fee 
And the ladies have also put their prices up... 
Since when is a rnt more pricey than full service?  

Just my 2 cents

Temple,I think you have just set a new record for the highest price paid for a tug in this country.
For a start,their hourly charge is already at least $30 higher than most places and to pay a girl in her 30s $100 just to take her clothes off and give you a tug is just plain dumb.
If you had $200 to spend and wanted "comfort" why not go to a brothel where you can have sex on a bed?

As an RnT fan who agrees that prices are getting outta hand. Still, I can see why some people don't mind paying. 

Why High End RnT ( & Rnt in general)

• No walk of shame - get spotted walking out of a high end massage place by workmate/wife/cousin doesn't have the same implications as walking out of a well known parlour or RnT that anyone can tell is an obvious tug house. 
• Many people get sick of the parlour routine of Shower, Catbath, Fs & Crap parlour massage. The girls at parlours who break the mold (or have mastered the routine) & Don't charge extras can be booked out days in advance. 
• I myself am an Asian lover, but now & again as a treat I'll go to these higher priced places for a hot euro blonde.  If euro & aussie girls are your thing & asians are not,  the fact that "Sa-ree" in sunshine does massage, bbbj & fs for $120 p/h means nothing. Some punters would rather pay more to get the exact type of girl they want rather than settle even if it's cheaper. 
• A skilled hj is an art onto itself, & I personally have a more intense orgasm from a hi with the right buildup than from 80% of the fs sessions I've had at parlours.

The issue with places like Tokyo and Aloha is the girls are only getting 10% (at best ) of the initial outlay therefore substitute there income from the punter......

There seems to be enough mug punters out there that continue to pay such ridiculous prices ! 

Wise up fellas

Guys please if someone wants to pay this money for a service let them do so.  You have the choice to say no, I will not. These places really are not inflating the price, this is life.  A citizen and a Rolex both tell the time but are vastly different prices, should people not buy a Rolex because it's inflating the price of a Citizen? Should I buy a Porsche or a Kia?  They both go 40km/h through a school zone......

Some people want the finer things in life and are happy to pay for the privilege, or maybe they can't be stuffed searching high and low around Melbourne to find that special someone who provides the same service which might save them $50 or so.  Or maybe they are short on time and want a sure thing.  I could keep going on but I won't.

In a nutshell, we all have the right to choose and we shouldn't flame someone just because they choose something different to what we might choose.

Ps. As for being the most expensive tug in town, ever heard of a place called Bodyline?  You can pay virtually this amount for a half hour experience and still no FS.

Fletch,you don't seem to get it.
I don't care what anyone does with their money.What I care about is the flow on effect that such frivolous spending causes.Miss Alisha thinks the sight of her 31 year old naked body and her stimulation of Mr Temple is worth $100,Mr Temple agrees and pays up.Miss Alisha is so happy with herself that she tells one of her colleagues that the last fool just paid her $100 for a nude tug.Her colleague thinks to herself "Fuck that,I'm younger and hotter than she is,next time I'm charging $150".A lot of these girls work in more than one shop and also regularly jump ship so before long the word spreads and suddenly everyone starts charging $100.That's what I care about because that affects me.

As for your comment "These places really are not inflating the price",if they are charging $30-$40 per hour more than most other shops and staying in business,what message do you think that sends to the other shops?Read the previous paragraph if you're not sure. 

PS-Although I haven't been there myself,from reading reviews on here Bodyline appears to charge $240 for the same service Mr Temple received.As a brothel license is not cheap I would expect that such an establishment would obviously charge more than an unlicensed one.I was referring to unlicensed premises when I made my comment about the cost of Mr Temple's tug.

I read a review on an chinese girl here named quiny and I popped in early feb and was told she was on a holiday in china for a few weeks.  I popped in last week and enquired as to whether they still have quiny and I was told they do but she is in china for 10 days.  I was told she was returning.   I would book this women on her return if they are truthful, but just for a cheap massage

Saw ad on locanto. Rang and made a booking with Angelina. Nice clean venue with parking and back entrance. Rooms are large with shower and large massage table. Paid $100 to house. Was shown to the room. It was dimly lit with candles. Had a shower and waited on the table nude with towel on my back. After 5 mins, in comes a tall blonde russian girl with a russian accent. She asks what I wanted and I said lomi lomi massage. She gives a nice firm massage. I ask for extras and she said she doesn't normally do it but offered nude rnt for $100. She did an amazing body side. Nice B cups natural and fully shaven. The rub was slow and sensual and got me over the line. Not sure if other girls offer this service but she is very good. Will probably return when i can afford it.

This place has some keepers who know how to massage and tease, which is rare. However the price they charge isn't always justified. Avoid this Aussie girl called Suzie, mid 30s. Good look but very poor massage and tease.

Person's Name : Angelina

Establishment : Aloha massage

Date of Visit : 12/10/2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : I use the Locanto app, so not sure about the link.

Hours of Business : Open 7 days 10am to 10 pm 
Rates : 100/hr

Age : 30

Size/shape : Tall / Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Russian

Services Provided : RnT, bodyslide, mutuality touching.

Value for money/recommend? : Expensive but she's one of the few who truly enjoys intimacy

My experience/comments :
Went through the same drill with the owner and paid 100 for an hour. Some of the girls at this place has the tendency of cutting the massage short to shower and clean up, so be mindful that try to take your time. 

Angelina is quite quirky and she can actually hold a decent conversation with you if you feel like chatting, but this girl communicates better physically! Try to take your time to reciprocate every touch she offers you and establish a connection with her and she would surrender herself to you. Shes open to exchange and bodyslide, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

In the end it was an amazing finish for both of us if you know what I mean.

Date of Visit : March 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 1429A Toorak rd Camberwell

Phone :0401454505

Hours of Business : 10-10

Rates : 100 hr massage + extras

Age : 27

Size/shape : 10/12 curvy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian

Services Provided : massage , handjob, topless, body slide

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : Claire does her best to provide a good service but it's just not much good. massage is Ok at best. No Rythm feels disconnected and disjointed. Goes from legs to head , back to arms, then randomly grabs your hands. 
It's all a bit frustrating. It's just sort of whatever comes into her head and that's the problem right there. There not a lot going on up there. She says some things that make you really wonder if she hasn't fried her brain with drugs, or is just incredibly unaware of what punters do and don't wanna here in the room. Quite strange indeed. She's not unattractive but not really my idea of a stunner. Decent set is "B" cup tits, in reasonable shape. Quite hippy and largish arse but kinda suits her frame. Handjob and slide were OK without being great. I think she tries to be sexy , and just comes off awkward more than anything else. WIR- nope , but wasn't a bad punt , just not memorable either.

Diamondcutter the most exciting part of your review would have been mentioning the price for the extra's? This shop was popular for a while 5 years ago, but people move on when they have to pay extortion like prices for extra's, and this place lead the charge in that area.

Was in the area today, and noticed another Asian massage shop had opened up next door to this expensive western run massage joint, that is never reviewed anymore.i reckon this 
 poor new shop may have been open maybe for just a week before this Australia wide shutdown. With another over the road at 1/240 Warrigal rd, i wonder whether these 3 will return the same. A reg of mine believes some of these shops will get rental relief from there landlords due to the shutdown.

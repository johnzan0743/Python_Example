My experience/comments : decided to try here but was left very much underwhelmed  by experience 
 When i got there was greated by a hot little  number who quickly disappeared when some other worker came out from the back
I said i wanted to spend an hour when she offered me a qwick half hour deal with her but i wanted the first  girl i saw 
She agred and lead me way out back near the kitchen sink in a match box sized dingy room it looked like it was a storeroom with a table in it they then tried to get a heater working and finally they took my 75
I got undressed and amy lee returned to start 
When i asked about the nude she said to cold in here so we proceeded  about 20 mins in and some half arsed attempt at massage except for the lots of attention to my crack and sack she asked me to flip over
She gave me a quick oil over and the asked if there was something else i would like her to do at this point her face was looking at my groin and every time she spoke her breath would hit y old feller as she was hovering closely above it
And of course  here i was thinking a BJ on the catds with this one
I said yes of course  and she said how much i said it depends on what is on offer her reply  was the more you pay the more you get
Ok i said i normally  get hand for 20/30 depending on how good 
No she kept on saying more you pay better the sevice 
In the end we settled on 30 and another 20 semi nude with touching 
The highlight was after the ded was done and cleaned up the rest of the massage was good even got a good 10 mins of ball play and clit rubbing at the end 

WIR  yes if the place got some good reviews in the future
I might try the place a few doors down this week and report back

Establishment : Relaxation Massage 

Date of Visit : 29 November 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 713 Mountain Highway, Bayswater - 0451 880 188

Hours of Business : 10am until late

Rates : $50 for half hour

Age : 20s

Size/shape : Short, slim

Services Provided : HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Okay value

My experience/comments : So I tried Relaxation Massage, a few shops shy of the Angel massage parlour I visited earlier. This parlour stands out more than the other, having a pink frontage. Luckily it also has a very discreet back entrance leading from the rear car park.

Upon entry I was welcomed by a fairly attractive mamasan (didn't ask for her name) who insisted that I stay for Helen, a young Chinese masseuse.

I elected for the usual $50 30 min massage. Helen does a decent top body massage but her lower half massage is just rubbish with her wasting a good 15 mins just rubbing oil up and down my legs. Upon flip she offered $30 HJ and $50 HJ with her top off. I decided to go with the $30 HJ because she has no chest to speak of.

She has a good HJ technique with a nice two-hand twist motion. 

She is quiet, doesn't tease and doesn't smile.

So will I return? Yes, to try the mamasan. Helen unfortunately doesn't do it for me and pales in comparison to the bubbly Jasmine at Angel massage. 

Upon exit, mamasan was cooking up an aromatic fried rice storm near the back of shop.

Date of Visit : 27 December 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 713 Mountain Highway, Bayswater - 0451 880 188

My experience:

So further to my Pelham massage review, here is the bad punt.

Against my better judgment I did not go with the mamasan (as I promised to myself earlier) but was lured, again, by the younger Asian masseuse (Jessica).

Jessica is somewhat attractive with a sultry smile, and her inviting eyes and gestures persuaded me to try 30 mins with her.

Alas, she was incompetent in all facets of massage. I asked for hard first, and she merely poked me with her elbows in random spots on my back. I then asked her to switch to a soft sensual massage and she just clawed her fingers (in a not so arousing way - like a pet cat or dog) over my back. This lasted for about 20 or so mins and I spent most of the time wondering whether I should escalate to a complaint. I decided to let it go as a bad experience.

On the flip she offered a clothes HJ for $30. I thought why not. Somewhat predictably, her finish was mechanical and disappointing. One handed jack hammer with no real skill. It took a while to get over the line but I managed to conjure it. 

Will I return? No.

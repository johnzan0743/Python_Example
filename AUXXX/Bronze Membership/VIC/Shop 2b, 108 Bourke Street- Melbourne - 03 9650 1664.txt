Value for money/recommend? : Yes! 

My experience/comments : On my first try she was wearing a white t-top with black compression shorts. Could see some cleavage out of the top, and boy those looked good. She gave a really decent massage that really loosened all the tense knots. On the flip asked if I wanted something extra. Negotiated for a $30 HJ. Inspiration struck and I asked if she offered BBBJ or FS. The most she offered was CBJ, for which she was happy with $50. 

The CBJ itself was so-so, but she got onto the table with me, which facilitated me groping her butt and breasts. Got some sweets and tea after, which was nice. Definitely worth visiting if you're on a budget for a good time in the CBD.

My experience/comments : 
I had a free afternoon, so I popped in (no booking) during lunch. Told the lady at reception I was after a 1 hour massage, handed her the cash and was led to a room. Was told to get ready while she got the masseuse. I undressed and lay down on the massage table and after 5 mins Mimi/Bibi entered the room. I was able to see in the slightly dark room that she was relatively tall, slender and had a nice set of boobs on her. Her English was passable, but for the life of me could not clearly hear her name.

She did not ask if I wanted a firm or hard massage, however her massage skills were not completely vanilla. She was able to be relatively firm when I asked her to be, and overall would give her massage skills a 7/10. 

After around 20-25mins I was asked to turn over - where she pointed at my groin and asked if I wanted extra. After some haggling (she started at $80 for HE!?!?) we settled on $60 for HE. Nothing special to write home about.. .she simply got some lotion and began her task - no real teasing or build up. After I popped, she gave me a wet wipe and went to wash her hands. 

By now only 40mins had passed, so she continued her massage for another 15minutes before finishing up. Would I return? Unlikely.

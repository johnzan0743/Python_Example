My experience/comments :

I was needing a massage and prob hoping for some action so thought will give this places try. walked in and told there is someone available. 

Was led to a room and got told to take off clothes and lie down. 5 mins later, she came in and asked if I can speak mandarin. Told her no so our conversation was the normal few things. Great massage. Come the flip, she asked if I want it stroked. I asked how much. She wanted $50 but told her only $20. She was laughing and then said next time have to charge you $50. She proceeded with oil on her hands and started working in the shaft. Was quite good at it. Not rushing but slowly bringing it to blow it onto her hands. She cleaned me up then chit chatted a lil more. 

All in all ended up being an hour. So I will definitely return.

Came here again. It was a great massage. If you are looking for just a massage, look for Nicole. Works on Friday. No extras. Nothing.

What is with $50 for tug these days? Are lollies really that expensive?. I not tried this place but ended up with cherry ripe from rubber connection.

Most of girls at this place do extra. and the prices are ranging from $20 to $50. If you see a roll of toilet paper hide under the massage table, you can haggle to price. That's what I learned from my experience.

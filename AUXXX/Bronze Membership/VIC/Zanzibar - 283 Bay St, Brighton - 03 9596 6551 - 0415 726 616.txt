So yesterday I had some time to kill and some extra $$ in my pocket. As someone who lives in the South East Subs I felt obligated to check out another massage place. After all, I do need to cover all of them in the area.

I decided to go to one I've never been before in 283 Bay Street, Brighton. 

After couple of txts, I was on my way. There were couple of African girls and since I never done an African girl, I figured, why not.

I was told to go to one of the rooms which was ok. one of the girls came in . she was in her mid/late 20s (although I can never tell and I'm often wrong when it comes to Asian or African women).

She started with a towel to cover my back side...oh crap...we all know what that means.
The massage was very oily and not good (felt like a tuna fish in an oil can). The towel was on all the time but when she did my legs, sometimes 

I felt a bit of touch ...hope???

Then, the flip - again, towel on my tower.

I asked her why so much oil, she said it LOMI and its with lots of oil. Now, I've done LOMI (For real) at least 50 time and what I got from her was far from being LOMI.

Anyway , close to the end of the time, her hands were travelling mainly near the tower. It was obvious there is more than massage on the menu. BUT, I knew I have a date in the night which will most likely lead to proper sex, I have decided to have a different type of fun.

So I asked her "do you do anything else?"

her reply "like what?"

I said "anything other than massage"

She said "what do you mean?" with a giggle and a look on the towel.

It was obvious she was waiting for me to say what I want and for some reason, she didn't want to say what is on offer her self.

Which bring me to the question, do you prefer girls that ask directly or the ones that wait for you to ask?

I would rather ask as it may not happen.

Try Maggie there.

It depends,

Are you in the mood to play mind games or do you just want to "offload" some pressure.
I can say for me, I have had more than one occasions of both. Can't live with them, can't live without them. But its always best to be nice, because you get the best service!!

Cheers
Jas

My experience here was a around 3 months ago, sometime in May I believe. The girl I saw was African, in her 20's and if I recall correctly her name was Lily. She has a great body but I did not get to see it unfortunately.

The massage itself was done without towels or draping and a lot of oil was used as previous posts have mentioned, it did to me seem a fairly accurate interpretation of a Hawaiian Lomi Lomi massage, lots of over and under body strokes. Also, lots of vigorous intentional/accidental brushing of the old fella while face down and then once flipped many comments about how proud he was standing, and that perhaps he may need attention.

I agreed and inquired about what might be under her clothes, $200 was the ridiculous reply. After some discussion we agreed $50 (on top of $70 for the massage) for a HJ. Now this was ok but it should be noted, had I been clothed, not covered in oil with a very hard one I would have laughed, however I accepted this.

Overall it was a fun experience but not one I would rush back to, she is a strange girl that does not talk straight, some may enjoy this.

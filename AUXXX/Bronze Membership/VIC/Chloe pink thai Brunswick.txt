My experience/comments :

Walked in with no appointment on a rainy day, greeted by a cute woman who booked me in for the hour then was showed to the room by her. after waiting about 10 mins a Chloe came in to the room she was not what i was expecting, she had red hair with tattoos, nice body and a medium bust. For some reason was expecting a busty blonde American cheerleader type from receptionists description of her. Chloe was very bubbly and was talkative at the start, She started the massage which was reasonably goood mixture of firm strokes and light sensual touching, after about 15 mins she asked if i had been here before, I said yes then she asked if i wanted extras i chose a full naked with body slide option for $150. (not sure why i did at the time as this price seems outrages to me) Chloe proceeded to strip and then start the body slide, hen turned me over and continued the body slide then with some more oil trned it in to spanish and then the rub, Her service was great and non rushed we actually went a bit over time. Chloe is a great girl  who can hold down an interesting and intelligent conversation she is cute and provides a great service the only down side is a little pricey.

I would recommend her if you dont car about how much you spend.


Happy punting!

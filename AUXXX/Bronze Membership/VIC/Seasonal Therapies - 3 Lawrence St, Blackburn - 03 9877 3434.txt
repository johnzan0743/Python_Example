 My experience/comments :

So Im really only writing this to kick off the ball on this establishment as I've not read another review about it. All the signs are that it should be a R&T joint but I had no luck. There was a couple of strange things about it, heaven forbid it should be a legitimate massage parlour. They actually have a booking sheet on the counter at the front door and upon my exit Dianne gave me a $5 discount card for my next visit. There are a couple of other R&T joints just around the corner in this bit of Canterbury Road so I gave it a shot.

Needless to say it was a fairly pleasant and professional half hour massage, just no funny business. There were tissues, the masseuse seemed fine with a bit of touching but despite her complaining how warm it was she would not take off her clothes. 

I'm am sure your results may vary, please post a follow up if you do.

My experience/comments : 

I was going through locanto looking for another particular establishment, but stumbled upon the ad above (not the exact one as the pic has changed). Did a quick check to see what other ads by the same user were on there, and thought it was looking promising. Called up, booked for half an hour (just in case it was no go), and was told my therapist was Natalie.
Arrive on time. The entrance is on Johnston St (near Hoddle St), so felt a bit exposed walking in. 
It is upstairs as you walk through the door, and Natalie was waiting for me at the top. I was thinking it would be worth the massage alone if there were no extras, as she was a stunner. 
Anyway, did the intro, paid the money and was led to the room. It was a nice space, you could tell reno work had just finished. Not your usual rub and tug decor. I still wasn't sure what i was in for.
Anyway, I strip off (she can always tell me to put the jocks back on), and lay down.
Natalie comes back in and asks what sort - medium and nice please - and proceeds with a fantastic massage. It feels like she has had proper training.
Small talk ensues, I ask how long she has been at this place and was told it has only been open a week. I ask where she was before this and she said a massage place in Kew. I jokingly asked if it was 160 High St and she laughed said it was. Right, I think I'm on a winner.
Massage continues, then she does some lomi type strokes right underneath my groin, brushing / rubbing me as she does so. After this continues for a few minutes and I'm at attention, she asks me to turn over. She asks what I would like - tells me it's 50 for hand relief and 100 for fully nude. 
Really tempted for the fully nude, but there is only 5 minutes left, so just go for relief. Natalie certainly knows what she is doing, what an ending!
Didn't try any touching as it was my first time with her.
She offers me a shower or rubdown - opt for the rubdown.
I'm not sure when Natalie works here, or if she still works at Kew (so, not sure if this is another branch of the Kew shop)

Would I return? Yes!!  (after pay day.... $80 for an hour massage + $100 for fully nude - pricy, but i think it and she will be worth it)

Previously at 160 High St (although I've not been there in a while), i would be upfront with the massuse, let them know what i was after, that way I got full value for the $100 extra. That is, they were naked from the start of the massage rather than the last 10 minutes - much better value for money.

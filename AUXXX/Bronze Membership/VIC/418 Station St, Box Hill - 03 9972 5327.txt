Popped in a couple of weeks ago, around 8pm. The old dude runs from the back to grab me. Straight out he says full service $100. Pretty much the first words he spoke to me. I could see in the background the 2 girls on offer, neither of which were overly attractive, or young. Although even if they were, I doubt I would of stayed. This place had a real people smuggling feel about it, which no doubt is a lot of places, but you don't want to get the feeling as you walk in. The slimy old dude trying to push FS as you walk in, the feeling you are walking into a b-grade horror movie from the 80's (think Texas chainsaw massacre) with the decor and lighting, and the look on the WL's faces as they stood there waiting to see if I'll stay, all added up to me bailing. Each to their own, but this place didn't do it for me at all.

Please be aware the old guy who is the manager of this massage shop wears glasses and only wears tracksuits in his job.  Not all managers wear a suit ok.

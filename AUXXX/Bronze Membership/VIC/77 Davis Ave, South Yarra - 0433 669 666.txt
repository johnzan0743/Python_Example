My experience/comments : There's a bit of a glut of places to choose in this region for massage. I selected this one as there was a slow immediately available, and they were obviously offering extras (lomi lomi plus mini skirts). Christina was nice enough, not particularly chatty. Didn't intro herself. Never asked what type of massage I wanted. It wasn't very good. I've had MUCH better.

However, she was not shy, with plenty of non-accidental fondles before the flip.

After the flip, extras offered, no price mentioned. I gave $35, as it's what I had on me, and she seemed like she was trying to offer a good service. Plenty of caressing, even hopped up on the table so I could get a view of her looking me in the eye while she got to work. I mentioned she had a tiny little bottom, and she didn't mind me taking a quick peek. Also got a chuckle when I complimented her, and kissed her shoulder. Technique = meh.

Would I return? No. 

There was another girl manning the counter who had just come out of a massage. She was very hot. So I might try a different day.

Mush.

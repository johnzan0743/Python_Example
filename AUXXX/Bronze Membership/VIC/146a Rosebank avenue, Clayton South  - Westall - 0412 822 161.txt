My experience/comments :

I went there to book slim Indian girl but she was not working that day so I booked with another Indian girl named Tanya. She is near 25 years old girl.

Went into the room, nice clean room with fresh towels. She asked me about my choice for massage, I replied bit hard on my back but soft sensual on rest of body. She did good job.

I enjoyed her soft touch on inner sides of my legs and on my balls. I asked her about extra, $50 for nude and hj and $30 only for hj. So I opted for $50 nude hj.

She has nice tits of 12 C cup size and shaved pussy. So overall good massage, good value of money.

She told me she works Monday and Saturday . I will book her definitely next time.

My experience/comments :
I've has mixed experience with this place but since it's under new management, I decided to give it another go.
Unfortunately they only do 45min sessions on Friday because they're so busy, but this was definitely worth the time with Courtney.
She has long dark hair with big waves and a perfect figure being a professional dancer. She invited me to the room and it just started normal with the long stroke lomi technique. Her technique lacks a bit pace but and was a bit rushed, but as soon as she took off her clothes, I didn't really care about the techniques. She has the perfect petite pale body that you just want to lick all over her. Unfortunately she doesn't allow touching between the legs, but the back bodyslide allows plenty of opportunities to give her a good squeeze.
She was okay with exchange but I couldn't do much with her legs tightly closed.
Finished with the best HJ admiring her body.

Works Monday &amp; Friday only.

My experience/comments :
Having enjoyed my session with Courtney at NownZen, I decided to go back and try the other aussie therapist, Elle or Ellen. 
Called and was told she's not available, but there's a Sarah available. I said "okay, I'll give it a go."Big mistake.
She came out out a session when I arrived, and  I saw her in black tights. An okay body for her age, but there was something about her that was a bit nqr.
She led me into the small room behind the reception desk, and left to get some stuff. Came back and left again, which was just wierd. She then started asking whether ive seen the other therapists, and who exactly.
The Massage was nothing to be praised for. She then offer extra service, which I less and less interested in.
The way she talks is quite redundant and feels as if she keeps repeating herself. 

Overall a very bad experience and do not recommend unless you're looking for a bit case.

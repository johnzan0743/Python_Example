My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.
I walked into to this establishment midweek, hoping for a casual vacancy. It is in an industrial area in a industrial area, above a sex shop. Had to go back after booking, as busy. Shop is upstairs above a sex shop, so you can always while away some time waiting, after booking. 
On with the booking. 
The girl led me to a cubicle, not a room, with side walls, not full length, within a large area, not unlike an old warehouse. Girl was dressed in Tee with jeans, not very exciting. Atmosphere was somewhat clinical.
Back massage was 5/10 . On to the roll over, and the universal sign for a tug, $30 offer. Okayed and she went for it. Average tug. No to extras when asked. Language skills a little difficult in English. Found it hard to make a connection. 
Tug was 5/10. 
Have not been back, as I find much better on offer at North end of coast. 
VFM - have to be desperate. Not sure why it is so busy to need a booking. I can walk into almost any shop at Southport midweek without a booking.
WIR - no , not likely.

Thats it. They have a big "Massage" sign on a trailer on the main road out front, just so everyone knows what you are up to when you go in.

Warebegone, you were told a while back with an earlier Redbank attempt that Reviews without a name are of no use to our members. Thus it is not a complying Review. I suggest you make and effort to remember the provider's name. I suggest you write the Review soon after your visit rather than leave it 2 months like this one and you probably will remember the name.

I've had a very similar experience here and there have been a few other reviews that were the same. Girls are young and pretty enough but the service is very limited and extras are expensive

Person's Name : Jen

Establishment : 252 Jasper Road, Moorabin 0470 647 245 

Date of Visit : March 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : locanto Very nice relaxation with Asian massage

Hours of Business : 11-8

Rates : $50 for 30mins + $40 for hj

Age : 40+

Size/shape : slim / petite

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : massage and hj

Value for money/recommend? : Maybe

My experience/comments : 

Had drove by a few times and this place looked legit but for some reason decided to try it out. Walked in there was a door chime but no one at the door then came out a hot young Asian girl and asked what I was after pointing to a hand written price guide. Choose 30mins was asked to pay and led up to a dimly lit room and asked to strip and left saying Jen will be in. I was thinking not you who's Jen. Anyways did as was told and waited lying on the table. In comes a much older but slim women and started to oil up with the message with plenty of hints down there. I did ask to lighten on the oil but she didn't seem to understand. Anyways come the flip was asked hj for $40 just agreed and I must say technique was very good with lots of oil and ball play, finished had a hot towel wipe and left.

Hi Easty
your ML Jen seems a lil costly for the $$$. I can tell you ova WEST there are many ML range from $40 to $50 per 30min and if your lucky the Asians are hot!
heres a tip dont agree on the first price, as this is the ML highest $$$ and asking to negotiate just remember to smile and be polite.. trust me you have heaps of fun and keep the hard earned in the back pocket...

Has anyone given this place a try, judging by their locanto ads it seems like its owned by the same person that owns Expess massage on bourke road. 
Further evidence of this is that they dare charge $75 forn a 60 minutes

Yes mate change of management (taken over by management from 161 Burke Rd Glen Iris). All the vietnamese hotties in LBDs have gone, replaced with miscellaneous asians and caucs of various ages and quality. Bit of a punt (that's why its' called punting eh?), but should be no hassles getting some extras unless you're very unlucky or you're the subject of this thread.

Post Content: 
Person's Name : Georgia

Establishment : Kew Therapies

Date of Visit : 15/08/14

Hours of Business : 11am to late

Rates : 60mins / $100

Age : 19ish

Size/shape : 8 ... C cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian Blonde

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Not bad. Decent massage and tug skills from a hot blonde.

My experience/comments : I frequent this place quite often and while their prices are pretty steep, the quality of the girls are usually good.

Opted for the hour (minimum is 45 minutes at $90, or $100 for the hour so might as well go for the full hour)

Georgia is your young, fun loving blonde.  She said she used to be a dancer too.  Her massage techniques were not bad, my legs were quite sore and she did quite a good job loosening my calves and hammies.  I asked straight up for extras and given I am a regular here, she listed $50 for a tug, $70 for topless tug and $100 for nude tug.  Went for the $70 package.

Breasts are nice but she just had surgery done so they were a bit tender.  Tug technique not bad but nothing else was on offer.

Will I return?  Sure, if I am in the area but I always like to try the rest of the staff.

Person's Name : Rebecca

Establishment : Kew Therapies

Date of Visit : Early October

Hours of Business : 11am to late

Rates : 60mins / $100

Age : late 20s

Size/shape : 10 ... C cups (unsure, but by feel!)

Nationality or Ethnicity : German

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Pretty good

My experience/comments : In need for some desperate tug and rang up on a Sunday morning.  Only Rebecca was available although the guy tells me I really should try Gabrielle who works in the afternoon when I have time next visit.  

Paid my fees and waited for Rebecca.  She's okay looking, not ugly but not great looking either.

Go upstairs, strip off and she gives me a pretty crap massage.  I've always had decent massages here but Rebecca's was too soft and didn't have decent pressure to my liking.  But she's very nice and warm so I guess it wasn't so bad.

Offered $50 for a tug and it was good.  She allowed me to feel under her shirt which was good enough for me.  

Will I return?  Not really, will need to check out Gabrielle when I have some funds to spare again!

My experience/comments :

Found on locanto. Rang to make a booking. Was offered Rosie or British Daniella. Place has a rear entrance but tricky to find. Parking in the rear. Went through to reception and paid $100 to mamasan. Receptionist is hot. Was asked to go upstairs to room 1. Very large room with shower and massage table. Had a quick shower and laid on massage table and waited. A few minutes later,  in comes Daniella. Blonde tall lass. She asked what extras I wanted and I said nude rnt. She said $100 including exchange massage. Her massage is a bit a soft but sensual. After 20 mins,  we switch positions and I massge her. I really enjoyed this part as I could really get  agood feel her amazing body. After 15 mins we switch again and she gives a nice tug with a lot of rubbing on hwr large boobs. Very nice finish. Pricey but verry good.

Yes expensive but that is the going rate these days for non-asian RNT ladies. And if you are on atleast the minimum wage, and not many bills, you can afford an RNT at this shop once a week with no issues.

Im thinking this is getting a little off topic, but this is the most absurd statement i have seen it a while...How can you make such a generalisation into other peoples lives? I have no issue with this if you are strictly talking about your way of life, but it appears as if you are talking for all of us

 JAD therapy Kew - Manuella - 9853 5458
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Manuella

Establishment : Private Shop

Date of Visit : 9 April 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 9853 5458

Hours of Business : 10am to 8pm

Rates : $100/60 minutes + extras

Age : early 20s

Size/shape : 8-10

Nationality or Ethnicity : French

Services Provided : Massage with HR

Value for money/recommend? : Yes but bit exy

My experience/comments : 

Had been a regular at this joint a couple of years ago, however when their lease ran out I lost track of them. Didn't realise they had shifted just a couple of doors up.

Saw the usual ads and found one with a very pretty looking french girl. caught my fancy and I called the number, and lo and behold, was talking to the same guy from a few years ago. caught up about some of my faves from back then, albeit all of them have moved on.

went up and prepared for me masseuse. She walked in shortly and looked like the girl in the pics, just with heavy make up and clearly at the end of the business day. in short, the pic looks much better, probably taken when she was fresh, made up to go for a party or something, and probably a couple years younger. But its definitely the same girl. Looks wise she's very pretty. Also pretty well mannered and was open to chat.

I had made up my mind to broach extras immediately. Glad I did. agreed on happy ending sans fabric, and off we went. massage itself was nothing to write home about.. just application of a lot of oil all over the body. however what took the cake was the girl's tug technique. Clearly knows what she is doing, and got me off a fabulous two times in the hour. I left a very happy and satisfied man.

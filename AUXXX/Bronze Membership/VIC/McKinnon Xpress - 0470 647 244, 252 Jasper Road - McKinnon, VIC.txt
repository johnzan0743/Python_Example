My experience/comments : 

Arranged by text massage by Real, who also works at sister store on Burke Rd.
Arrived, paid $65.00 for the 45 mins massage, entered room stripped & onto table.
Real comes in, starts massage to a medium pressure,just as i likeit. After about 30 mins, flip over & she massages thighs and chest area. This gets me aroused however she seems to be avoiding the inevitable queries from me.
asked about extras at 35-40 mins point, cutting it fine timewise. Would not negotiate down for $50 topless or $100 completely nude.I press on with completely nude option as I have has some success proceeding down this avenue with daty & bbbj from other girls in the past.
Very attractive body to complement her face however apart from me performing massage on her, would not allow dty & a very sweet looking pussy. She completed job with barely average HJ. Speaking to her during clean up she suggested she prefers company of the fairer sex,wwhih is a shame as she is a very good looker, however the vibe during the latter stages  was slightly odd as she did not exhibit the enthusiasm some of the other girl I have encountered there.
Would I return, probably only for the massage no extras.

Getting urges again was thinking about visiting my old favourite place but thought I wanted a little excitement. So I went to her sister shop in Mckinnon.

Rang up and made an appointment for 9:30pm. This place isn't the greatest if you are trying to avoid the walk of shame, its next to a pizza shop and a TAB which are both busy and opened late.

Rock up at 9:30pm walk in and wait for the receptionist. In walks Real(maybe wrong name?), she is absoloutely stunning. Thai girl about mid 20s, very pretty with curves. 
Showed me to a room and I do the usual. Lying there I was hoping she would walk back in and she does 

Quite a good massage for this kind of places, could easily pass off for a legit deep tissue. Flip over with about 20mins to go, also takes the towel off. Keeps massaging, dosen't ask me anything. Thought I would give it a little time before I ask. Before I know it she say "All done I go grab some towels". Disappointmented would describe me perfectly right now.

Cleans me up, I say thank you and go home.

I pretty sure she does extras, I think I remember reading on this forum once about a girl named Real who works at this parlour. Writing this review so I can get access again so I can check. Will write back after I try again. Wish me luck

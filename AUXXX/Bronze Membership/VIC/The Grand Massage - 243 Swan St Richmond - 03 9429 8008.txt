Value for money/recommend? : Yes but may not always be fruitful for punters. Can confirm it's clean and quiet with good massage.

My experience/comments : 

I often walk past this place and decided to go in to sort out some neck pain. I didn't have a booking but they easily slipped me in. 

I was met at the front desk by an old Asian lady who took me down the hall to a room. I stripped down to underwear as I was not sure about this place and it was not my primary reason for being there. A pretty girl came to the room and she covered me with a towel and asked if she could focus on anything in particular. I would not have hesitated in giving her a tip for extras but it did not seem like the place. It was incredibly dark in the rooms though very quiet.

On the flip she kept me covered with the towel and massaged me all over. I must say she was really good. She used up the entire hour and I left satisfied but it is on the higher side for 60mins at $80.
This place seems legit but the decor and appearance outside and in tends to indicate otherwise. It may really depend on who is booked or who you get at the desk at the time. I would go back for the massage alone.

Kate must be a one off mph998 Ihave had every service you would want here ( although I haven’t visited for about 12 months so maybe the game has changed) Bemused on your comment about the website . Isn’t that a standard sign.

It looks like a shop where u may be assigned a massage lady. I gather just looking at the entry, with the Chinese writing on the top of the entry door, that there may be a swag of sexy Chinese girls working here.

Popped in Saturday, 2 older girls one on reception, the other hiding in tradition Chinese massage gear. They were not appealing at all. I expected there to be a bunch of young chinese girls, who would either present, or u were given one who would walk all over your back with there feet, as per royal massage all those years ago. This place seems to be a waste of a wonderful set up at this stage

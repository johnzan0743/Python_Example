Hi snoutmobile
I tried this place twice in 2013 and was refused twice. Both times the girls didn't look surprised or bothered and were very polite. I will give it another try soon.
Cheers

 Date of Visit : 10/12/15

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 275 Huntingdale Road, Chadstone 3148. 03 9807 3999

 Hours of Business : 9AM-8PM

 Rates : $55/ 30 mins

 Age : 20

 Size/shape : Hot slim fit body with size B boobs

 Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

 Services Provided : Massage, hj 

 Value for money/recommend? : Bit pricey, $50 for just hj and boobs touching

 Came here after had a crap massage in Ashburton and I'm quite happy with the service here. The premise is very nice and clean with candle fragrance. The room is big and well prepared. Booked for 1/2 hour and met Kitty. She's a hot looking girl in white skirt. I feel so good when she started touching my body. The massage was excellent with lot of touching around my balls. She's very experience in making you feel exotic. Turning over and asked if she offered extra. She said yes $50 for hj but touching only, no nude. I know that's pricey hence I normally pay $50 for nude hj but she's so hot so I didn't want to bargain. The hj is perfect. If you are willing to pay that price then I highly recommend Kitty.

I popped into the east Malvern cloverleaf a few days ago thinking the review was from here, and the girl told me she didn't know when kitty was working again, understandable when she works at the other one.

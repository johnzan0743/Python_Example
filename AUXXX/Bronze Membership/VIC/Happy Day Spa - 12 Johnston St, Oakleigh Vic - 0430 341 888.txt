My experience/comments :

Got  in room at 2.25 and told to get ready...
no heating on and had to wait nearly 10 minutes before Haanah entered room ...by the time she got the heater going I was irritated...that subsided when she started to massage by back with long slow strokes..this went on for about 10 minutes ...we then started on the subject of extras...her only offer was hand relief for $30.00 of which I hesitated to but decided to accept as her massage was half descent...I was told that money had to be up front...I gingerly rose off the table to pay her..( I should of left there and then ) as all of a sudden everything became a mad rush..I her job was done she wanted to clean me up and send me on my merry way...I let her know thatmv time wasn't up and I wanted to finish the massage...all of a sudden it was as if she no longer knew what to do..I got up got dressed and left...would I go back??? Definitely not

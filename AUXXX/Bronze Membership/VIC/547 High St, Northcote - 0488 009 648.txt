My experience/comments : 

I had a day off, was bored by lunchtime so started looking through locanto. Found the add linked above. I have been here before, but with no luck. So i was curious about them now advertising here. It is (was?) be owned by the person who runs Cheva Massage across the road (another place i have had no luck with).
Anyway, called up and got the above prices. I wasn't sure what the go was, so only booked for half hour relaxation. Turned up and was greeted, by a largish Australian girl. Not really doing it for me. Didn't have the balls to ask for anyone else, but i could hear that there were other people in the shop.
She straight out asked if i wanted happy ending or nude exchange - no thanks. I think she got a bit shitty at this. I did ask about the prices, and she said happy ending was included in the exchange massage price.
Would I return? Maybe, but not for the one who massaged me. $150.00 for a 60 min nude exchange massage with happy ending doesn't seem to bad for prices these day?

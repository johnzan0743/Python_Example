My experience/comments : 

I rang Three Sisters and spoke to Mary to see if Amanda was on but she said she doesn't work Wednesdays.. oh..the review was wrong.

Anyhow, I though I would try boronia where she is Angela..she was not on ..then over to Tulip which is owned by the same mamasan..no avail.

I was greeted by Helen a quite attractive lady wit good english as  she worked also in England.

i went for the half hour option.

Stripped down put a pineapple on the side table and awaited. Thankfully she was not like others and was prompt in returning .

She quickly pocketed the readies.

The massage was on the light side but very good oil and no use of crappy oil which stinks. On the flip she stripped down to reveal and nice but not athletic body. B size boobs  with a smooth burger.

No kissing but allowed FIV and some daty...gave a nice finish and extracted every drop.

Overall a good experience.

 Blackburn South revisited
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : AMY

Establishment : 68c south Parade, Blackburn South

Date of Visit : 31/12/2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0449 008 636

Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm

Rates : $50 1/2 massage.

Age : 24

Size/shape : size 7/8

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : nude hj

Value for money/recommend? : so so.

I decided to revisit an oldie as the location is close to my house. Got there at 12.30 and entered the massage shop and was greeted by a male and asked how long did i want. I replied 1/2 hr thanks and at the same time a wl approaches me and asks me to follow her to a room which is located on the right as you walk in.She closes the door and asks for $50 for the massage. I hand over the money and ask her about nude hj. she nods yes, can do. So she leaves the room and asks me to undress which i do and i waited for 5 mins for her to return.

I lay on the table face down and she asks how would i like the massage to which i reply soft and sensual not too much oil please. The massage is rubbish but in the meantime i place my hand on her leg and proceeded to gently stroke it. She doesnt object as we engage in small talk. She tells me her name, age, origin and she works Monday and wednesday only.She claims she is studying accounting but how would you know. Any way as we are talking im feeling her bum and to me its felt clamie not smooth as one would expect. This is because as i found out later that when she is finished she wipes her self down with those wet towelets . 

So here i am not really enjoying it so turn around and ask her and remove her clothes (she had a dress on, bare legs) and proceed with hj. She indicated $50 for that service to which i agree. She quickly removes all and asks would i like a bbbj. I said no just a handy thanks. As she is stroking my cock i am allowed to finger her ,suck her nipples which are ok size but her tits are small. she is not bad at finally getting me over the line and there is no doubt in my mind that more is on offer. She hand me some of wet toweletes  for me to clean myself up whilst she does the same to herself. 

wir. not sure.

For any members who liked coco ex mei wei, and her alias yoyo at middlesborough rd, she is working in the massage industry after a failed business venture. I met her at reception at 68c south parade this Wednesday while on a lunch break.  I felt sorry for her as she wanted to make her milk bar work but it wasn't to be.  If u miss her and want to see her, weds she works here, and other shops she wouldn't reveal to me

Person's Name : Unknown (I tried)

Establishment : 68C South Pde, Blackburn

Date of Visit : 14 Mar 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0449 008 636. I thought it was on Locanto but can't locate it now. I went based on Chichi Big Dog's review with Amy above.

Hours of Business : Not sure

Rates : $50 for 1/2 massage, $30 for HJ (clothed)

Age : mid 20's

Size/shape : Tall, athletic

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese (think)

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : $80 for a reasonable massage and HJ, maybe

My experience/comments :

I'm usually a Melbourne CBD guy only but knew I would be out in the eastern suburbs and recalled seeing some ad's out in that area so found one that had had a reasonable review and dropped in. I did't call and book. GoogleMaps for the address 68C gives a confusing location in a back lane, don't worry about that, it is right on South Pde and is clearly signed with parking right out front. Walked in, a couple of older women were sitting behind a low height partition chatting, one came out, asked for 1/2 massage, $50, go into second room, girl will be with you shortly. The whole place was very clean, the room walls went full height and the massage table was covered with clean towels and disposable face things. Down to the boxers. Lie on table. Girl comes in with a little red bucket of warm soapy water and a white face cloth. She's fairly tall, athletic and good looking. Doesn't say anything and get's some oil to start. I say "take these off"? She replies "Ok" (first time she spoke). Good massage followed with a big of bum crack and inner leg teasing. While it was good it was not doing much for me. Cleaned up my back and legs with the wet face clothe. Turn over came, asked about extras, "$30 hand job", topless and offered $50?, "No", touching, "Ok", reluctant. So she gets into it in a slow teasing way which was nice, but not great. I touch her legs, back and breasts through the clothes. Breasts seemed to be some sort of inserts in the bra, odd. I come and she keeps going for a bit which was mix of pleasure and too sensitive. Cleans up with tissues and wet face cloth. Try to talk for a bit, she only works on Saturday. Her English seemed good when she spoke, but she didn't want to talk. Waits for the extra $, then leaves.

It is a very quiet area and the only sounds during the massage were the two women chatting in reception. At what I would guess was the half hour point, a guy came in and said something like I'm x for the x appointment with x. Women calls out "Rachel" your appointment is here. So, maybe Rachel's the go. Another guy came in about 5 minutes after that and waited.

WIR: Very clean and well managed, which i like. But, was not sensual or erotic. Maybe if I was in the area - but I wouldn't go on Saturday to avoid the same girl.

Came here the other day after reading the as on Locanto. 

The massage was great but again nothing was offered. She saw my erected member and asked if I want someone else to come in as she doesn't do extras. Not a fan of that so just had a massage that night. 

Any other reviews?

Never had an issue there myself ... been about half a dozen times, different girl each time. $45 for half an hour plus $30 for Nude HJ (I always ask for extras at the end). Anyway, there's always Tulip Massage just around the corner for similar prices (but the place is a bit of a dump by comparison).

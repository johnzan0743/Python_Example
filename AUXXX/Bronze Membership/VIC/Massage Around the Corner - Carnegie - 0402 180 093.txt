Happened to see that this place had reopened so thought I'd pop in and have a look. Waited at the counter for a minute or so until Tania appeared. Quickly ushered into the room and got ready. The place is still rather shabby in a way...anyway, asking for a medium massage, this was actually really good. Very strong. Flipped then asked whether I wanted any extras - opted for a tug, though no mention of extra cost...she executed diligently, encouraging me to let my hands wander everywhere...some time left over afterwards so she continued to massage and chat.

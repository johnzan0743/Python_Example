 Melbourne Paramount Centre - Sabaydee Massage Day Spa
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : MiMi, could be wrong as I had my head resting in the massage table head pace

Establishment : Sabaydee Massage Day Spa

Date of Visit : 20/12/2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 4 Paramount Centre in Melbourne CBD

Hours of Business : 10am till late

Rates : 30mins / $40

Age : 45 plus

Size/shape : A-cup, size 8, about 160cm

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : R&T (tug for $30)

Value for money/recommend? : maybe, but definitely not with this old hag

My experience/comments : Last day at work for the year and had an hour to kill.  Had read some glowing reviews from another forum for this place and decided to give it a try.  Walking up, i paused as the lady at the door could be my mum.  

Again, thinking about the glowing review, perhaps the one greeting me is not the one doing the service.  Hand over the cash and went into the room. 

Same hag comes in and my heart drops.  I strip to my jocks and lie down.  She does quite a nice massage for about 25 minutes.  Quite enjoyable.

On the flip, she motions if I want a tug.  Thinking her massage skills were quite nice, i thought he tugging may match.  I node and she hold up 5 fingers.  WTF?  We settle on $30. Which made her mood change from being friendly to icy.  All the while through the exchange i was feeling her ass and crotch, but after paying she whispered that i cannot touch unless i paid another $30.  Again WTF?

A very mechanical tug ensued, one which had me close my eyes and hope to com quicker.  Complete waste of $30.

Body: 6/10, A-cup, thin, nothing outstanding
Massage: 7/10, quite nice

 April - Paramount Centre RNT
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : April

Establishment : Sabadydee, Paramount Centre Bourke Street Melbourne

Date of Visit : April 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Paramount Centre Bourke Street Melbourne

Hours of Business : 10am - late

Rates : $40 for 30 minutes

Age : late 30s

Size/shape : Slim but nice body

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian (think Taiwanese)

Services Provided : RNT

Value for money/recommend? : Reasonable and good at tug so would recommend.

My experience/comments :

Went to an RNT not far from work and walked in and was given April.  Rooms lockable but very thin walls that don't go all the way to the top.  Massage started nice, then half way through went for flip.  She straight away offered services but only HJ, no topless or nude.  Asked $30 for it and I said ok.  Gave a good tug, lots of sexy looks, nice play with ass as well. Got job done nicely.  Would recommend again.

 Gigi - Sabaydee massage Melbourne CBD
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Gigi

Establishment : Sabaydee Melbourne CBD, 9972 8305

Date of Visit : 6/11/14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Paramount Centre, level 1, 101 Little Bourke Street Melbourne CBD[COLOR=#222222]

Hours of Business : 11am - 10pm [/COLOR]Rates : $60 for 45 mins plus $50 for tug

Age : 30-40

Size/shape : size 8, about B cup 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Rub n Tug

Value for money/recommend? :  Excellent service, not necessarily value for money - YMMV

My experience/comments : Gigi provided an excellent combination of a superb massage, she really identified my sore spots and worked them really well.  At one stage she put all of her body weight into applying pressure to my lower back, which was a beautiful combination of pleasure and pain!  The massage really was as good as anywhere I've had and was worth it alone.

As the time progressed, her touch became lighter and more sensual, focussing on my butt and inner leg area, with generous work on the ball sack, making it clear what was to come!  by the time she asked me to turn over, I was in heaven and ready to agree to anything.

After some gentle stroking of my chest and stomach, she learnt over and whispered in my ear whether I would like a "special massage".  Yes please!  Only thing that took some gloss off was she asked for $60, which was damn steep - I had expected $50 which was exactly what I had on me, which I told her.  She suggested I go to the ATM for more, but i said no and shrugged my shoulders - I was quite happy with the massage I had and wasn't going to get pushed into getting my kit back on just for that!  She eventually settled for $50, and fortunately wasn't pissed at me or anything as she proceeded to deliver a wonderful tug, using just the right amount of technique and knowing when to back off to let things build up to a great crescendo!

Really enjoyable, shame about the batering (which I a bit of a turn off for me) but a real professional.

Age : Early 30s

Size/shape : 10 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RNT

Value for money/recommend? Not really. $$ for what it is. $50 for tug

My experience/comments: 
Was out with mates n managed to get a spot for the 2 of us late before they close. Massage was gd. Firm. Lots of oil on legs n back. I was pretty tired from a gd night out with mates. It felt pretty gd. When she added oil along the bum crack.. I knew... I allowed her to tease and opened my legs a bit for her to reach under. I flip over n she indicates $50 n can touch. as always the small brain was thinking.. Very $$ for just a tug!! But cave in when she starts playing with it already. Great technique with lots of oil n not rushed. 

WIR? nope too $$

I've been here a couple of times now and each time the girls have made it very clear that it is $50 for a tug...forget haggling.   It is what it is I suppose. That said the quality is pretty good and they do have generally favorable reviews...

It's much better to enhance the credibility of your report with the formality of a review (on the template).

If it wasn't too long ago, please go ahead and post a review.

I've visited this establishment before and it's always $50 for extras, no negotiation.  Know what they're doing however, and usually a good massage as well.

I have been to both paramount and stkilda and both times i have been polite and made suggestive comments and both times been shot down and told we don't do that here. I must have copped a chick on her rags both times. Massage was awesome x 1000 though so worth going back for sure.

Gave the Paramount shop another go and come up trumps with Kylie

Name : Sabaydee
Date : 30/12/14
Address : Paramount Bourke st melbourne
Hours : 10am - 10pm
Rates : $140 for 2 hour massage + $50 for a very happy ending
Age: late 20's
Size : size 10
Nationality : Singarpore
Service : great massage with great rnt
Value for money : Yep

If you love a massage as much as the ending then kylie is spot on for this.  Started with some lomi lomi styles then moved onto relaxtion.  After about 90 minutes she released the pressure that was built in my balls, cleaned me up and then gave me another 30 minutes of relaxing massage.  I walked out feeling fan-fucking-tastic.

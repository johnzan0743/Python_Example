HA HA Dude. $80 is UNDER the normal cost for normal extras these days. This was my first booking with her so didn't know how much she charges for extras. I know for next time if/when I book her again.

The old trusty 'No offense BUT'. That's like saying im not racist BUT.

And prices will get higher and higher when cost of living increases also. It's just the normal thing these days. Some people are still living in hope of paying 1990s prices. They need to realise that is long gone, 20 years ago and get with the times or find another outlet for their sexual frustrations.

Leave it at that please guys. If you want to discuss prices etc, brauninc has about 6 threads going on that topic at the moment 
You can discuss in detail in one of those....

I don't get the purpose of the pictures.
Which picture is the American Body?  The horse, the jockey or the photos of girls from the Internet (who I assume aren't the massage therapist subject of the review).
Lost me. I can't interpret the review and whether I should go to the premises.

Elle McPherson is Australian and known in the modelling industry as The Body. The horse? Who cares...

Million Dollar Man is well known for obtuse posting

MDM you can keep posting these 'funny' reviews if you wish, but please remember reviews without names are pretty much useless and of no help to our members. Another thing you should keep in mind is that these last 2 reviews do not count in your post tally in your quest for Silver membership. Reviews without, names  and contact details are considered non compliant and are not be counted.

Yes I know that.My post was referring to the massage girl's name.Her name is Elle (hence the photo,presumably) and she is American or Canadian.I can see how it was a bit ambiguous.
It would have been easier to just put her name in the review.....

Both Amy & Nora/Sophie are now allowing FS for customers due to their desperation for money. With Nora/Sophie potentially moving in to the Escort part of the industry in the future.

So MDM, I can't see any FS reviews for this shop/ladies, have you actually had FS with one/both of these ladies or is this rumor at this stage?

As I stated, I have it from a very good reliable good source. A mutual friend. Both ladies have recently, very recently flagged the idea of making FS available for customers/clients. It's up to the client(s) to inquire about it.

No. Because I have no intention of booking them. They are both evil, very evil. Go contact the shop, make a booking then when you both are in the room alone at the start of the booking, ask her how much for FS. Take a condom with you also.

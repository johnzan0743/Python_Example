[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments :[/COLOR] I was in the city on Saturday and decided to give Yuki a call after seeing the ad on locanto, she told me she was free in i said i would de there in 5 min. She told to me call her when i was in the lobby and she would come and get me. The lift opened and a cute little thing came out and took me up to the floor and down the hall to the room past some offices and to the room which the door was already opened and once i was inside the door stayed opened, a bad sign. She then directed me into the massage room & asked for how long and i said 30 min and i gave her the 40 bucks and she left the room. After i undressed i lied down on the table, she came in and left the door open and chucked a towel over me and started the massage. The massage was okay but she didnt say a word and neither did i and after the 30 min said "finished thank you" and quickly left the room and when i got dressed so did i never to return.

In the ad it says "Come to see me and I will let you feel more also happy more!"
I would have asked her for a HJ.   If she's offended by it then it's her problem. Don't use the word "happy" in your ad if you are only doing pure massage.

BTW is the photo in the ad real?

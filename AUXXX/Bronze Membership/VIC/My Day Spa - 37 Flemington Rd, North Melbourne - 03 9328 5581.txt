My experience/comments :


Popped in on my way home from work to unwind and was greeted by Elise, a gorgeous Thai girl in her mid twenties.  Was shown to the room and left to strip off.  
Took off the undies and dimmed the lights a little lower to be a bit more discreet as I never cover with a towel.  Elise gave me a very professional massage in all the right places.
Applied some extra oil after the turn and proceeded to give me a long and lingering hand job until I exploded a few days worth of backed up man fat all up her arms.


Great massage and excellent finish.  Would definitely return.

Did you have to pay extra for the tug or was it included?

Most of us would find that sort of info would be helpful if it was in the review.

$30 seems to get the job done with most girls here. Perhaps the more attractive girls will milk a bit more out of you (pardon the pun).

My experience/comments :
The owner....
Been here a few times now. The lady who takes my money at the front did me as my usual lady Anna wasnt available
Now you'd think the owner would put in a good effort to a regular customer..NO!
Half arsed massage - nothing good in her technique or attitude.
And nothing sensual warm or even a sign of enthusiasm.
Come the flip -she just grabbed my dick and started milking me like a frakkin cow. Mooooo
She even tugged me with a frustrated look on her face. Males are strange creatures arnt we?
Instead of telling her to stop... i made myself come rather go through any more cock torture.
So -boys...if the owner here wants to tug you- make a dash for it!
Thanks Uncle Trevor- no prob guys!

Persons Name: Linda (that's what she said!)

Establishment: Full Body Care

Date of Visit: November 28th 2014

Address: Shop 19 Paramount Shopping Centre, Bourke Street Melbourne

Rates: $50 for 1 hour massage  ($1 per minute for less time) plus $30 for HJ

Age:   40s, but still in pretty good shape

Nationality: PRC

Value for Money: Great value 

Was walking through the city and wandered into the Paramount Centre.  Notice a few places offering massage so i check them out.

Walked into Full Body Care and greeted by a 40+ Chinese lady who explains the rates and details.  Opt for 1 hour massage.


Takes me to the room and and says to undress and hop on the table under the towel. On her return she gets to work on my back and legs giving me a very good massage.  The  towel is removed, (I smile to myself) and now her hand is on my butt, with her fingers wandering all over my rear end. (nice)

This goes on for about 5 minutes  and she then says turn over which I do but no towel is placed on me.  SHe satrts on my legs working up very close to the tops of them then leans over my head rubbing her boobs, although clothed, up and down my face whilst going down very close to the 'nether' regions.  She goes to my side and starts massaging very close to the nether regions and asks if I want anything 'extra'.  

I ask how much and we agree on $30  Linda's technique was well practised and it was very enjoyable and she allowed touching under her top. Cleaned me up with a warm hand towel and dried me off.

She asked if I'd return which i said i would.  

At her age she may not be everyone's cup of tea, but great value is to be had there.

My experience/comments : 
Pretty new to Melbourne. Knew that there was something on offer in Paramount but could not figure out which one offered extras. So finally after looking around all the floors, went into this place and asked for full body. 30$ for 30 mins and 40$ for 45 mins. Opted for 45 mins and was asked to wait. 

After about 10 minutes i was escorted to the room. Pretty basic stuff and curtain partition. This beautiful female named Yuki comes in. She says she's from HongKong. 

She almost puts me to sleep with her awesome oil massage but there was no mention about extras. Finally after about 40 minutes she says its done and will bring water. I ask her if there's any extras. 

She smiles and tells me I should have told this before. Asks me how much I'm willing to pay. I say 20, she finally agrees for 30 for HJ. 

She's got magical hands. The already excited me dint waste much of her time. She allowed touching her beautiful tits. 

I leave happy. She tells me to book in advance for a better experience. Definitely worth another visit.

[COLOR=rgb(51, 51, 51)]My experience/comments : [/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]It is not my liking writing bad reviews agaisnt any ML. I understand they all try very hard to earn their money. Some are more generous than others, sometimes you feel you are being cheated. This was my case at this obscure AMP. [/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]I've seen locanto ads and other references for this address and decided to take a punt. Middle age, short, dark skin lady in tight shorts and t-shirt took my $70 payment for 1 hour. Got naked and the regular process started. Massage was OK but not as good as professional Thai massage. I love a good Thai massage and I am a regular at a couple of legit shops where I know I get some of the best. She massaged my back, legs and bump and made a few brushes of the jewels, again nothing extraordinary.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]The session was getting pretty boring . She asked me to turn around and with 15min to the hour (they all have the same routine) I was asked the HJ question and quoted $40. I wasn't that enthusiastic and I replied if she could take the clothes off. There was an immediate 'No' answer, just the BJ and no touching. I should have said 'No thanks' but I gave her the OK. The job was terrible and despite my hand sliding under her shorts, there was a disappointing unfinished attempt so I told her to stop and that it didn't matter. She kept quiet and finished the massage session.

On the way out I gave her $20 and she looked at me surprised and a bit angry. It's $40! you can use credit card, she said and pulled out the little ATM machine. No it's OK, I said, this is what I feel was worth it. I don't think she was listening and kept nagging and almost yelling for her $40, and asking for my credit card. This is an awkward scene to put it nicely. So I pulled another $10, dropped on her desk and left without saying anything. I was expecting the yelling to come out on the street but she kept inside and I walked away towards Victoria Gardens to catch the tram. You win some, you lose some.[/COLOR]

Haha. Always the opportunist I am. I do amit by my own reckoning that June and the start of July have been pretty busy. I do feel very relaxed though.

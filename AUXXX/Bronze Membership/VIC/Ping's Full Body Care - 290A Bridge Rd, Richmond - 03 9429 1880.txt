[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments : I have been here couple of time and I really needed massage! $ 30 for 30 min!! Why not!! So went inside and was greeted by a mature age lady with too much make but didn't speak much English! She took me to the massage cubical and left! I left my undies on and jumped on the table!! She walked in and asked if she could take if off! Sure!! But I was there really for massage and didn't care much about tug!! Anyways her massage skills weren't good!! Just gentle pressure and below average skills!! After 10 min flip!! If it is a good massage and ML gets me aroused then I usually say yes but here no way!! She made tug gesture saying really nice for $30!! I politely declined and in another 10 min she finished!! I gave her $ 50 before she started massage and no change was given!! So I asked her about change and gave me $10 back!! I tried to explain it was only 20 min, I asked for 30 and she gave me back just $10! Called another lady who spoke English!! She said sorry and gave me back another $20, charging me $20 for 20 min and insisting me to stay but I was already dressed and wanted to leave!! There is no ambience and they talk with each other a bit too frequently and you can hear everything what going on!!! So I have decided not to visit here anymore!![/COLOR]

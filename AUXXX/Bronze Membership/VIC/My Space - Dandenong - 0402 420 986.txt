My experience/comments : Found ad on locanto so dropped in to have a look. Absolute shit area, had difficulty finding it. Eventually went into building & upstairs looking for a flashing sign but nothing. Found a door with a doorbell & figured this looks promising. Sure enough, old mamassn opens door & ushers me in. Says they're busy but come back in 1 hour for nice young girl. So I did.
Jessie was an absolute cutie! Half decent massage, not much sack tickle but enough to get the blood flowing. On the flip I asked if she could please get her gear off. She said doesn't do that but will give him massage for $30. Didn't argue, especially cause I was rubbing her clothed ass & tits through the whole negotiation. 
She did a great job, slowly working shaft & balls & built it up to a good speed for take off. She was young, cute, great petite body with a flirty friendly personality. Spot on, not what I thought I'd find in those surroundings.

Went to this massage parlour without name but advertised on locanto. Wanted to try the Japanese masseur but she was away. So decided to try this young thai girl to hope for decent massage and extra work hehe.. face not my cup of tea but who cares so long she can give extra HJ in a cold and wet day. Went to this place and took her for 30 mins. Massage so so only despite she is from Thai... but quite young and smoot skin. After 25 mins of massage, she asked me to turn over where she asked wanted to go for HJ. She said HJ $30 and if naked will be $50. so I decided to pay her $50 and she gave me HJ and allowed me to touched her nipples and down south. I played her vagina for 10 5-10 mins before I shoot my load on her... overall experience not too bad but she is not my cup of tea that's why I will not go back for her.

I saw the  add on Locanto and decided to call and see if Bella was working. Was told she is not normally there on a Tuesday but she happened to be there at the time and was willing to stay to take a booking. So i booked and headed there. 

Katie the owner was there when i arrived and said to Bella to take me to the next door room and that i was a regular. I hadn't been there in almost a year so she has a good memory. Bella was not as attractive as the photo on Locanto and was wearing baggy clothing so couldn't get an idea of her body until later.

I booked for 1 hour as i have had good massages from this shop in the past. Her massage was ok, ive had a lot worse but also a lot better. She started with the legs and spent about 30 mins on them with maybe a couple of accidental brushings. Then all of a sudden she went straight to it. She put one hand on my butt and the other went down under and played with my balls and cock for a minute or 2 before moving on to massaging my back. The one odd thing was she kept the towel on my butt the whole time and did not massage there at all. 

Then when the flip came she got rid of the towel and i was starting to get hard again, she straight away asked if i wanted the tug and said $30. I asked for nude and she said $50 so i agreed and after paying upfront, off went the clothes. She had a pretty good body with nice firm tits hidden away under there. She let me touch anywhere so i then asked as she was tugging if DATY was on offer. She said she would do it for another $50, I tried to negotiate down but she wouldn't go any lower so i decided to save the money. The tug was ok and i got over the line while playing with her boobs and puss. Then she cleaned up and that was it. Got dressed and off i went. 

WIR: yes but probably not with Bella. The whole experience seemed like a 5/10. Ive had better and I've had worse.

My experience/comments : Saw Ad on Gumtree, texted for info. Booked for 1hour. Got to a private home in St. Albans, no flashy lights, didn't know what Nationality to expect, didnt really bother me but the door bell gave it away, it was a chinese aftermarket one lol.

ML opened the door ushered me into a room, nice and bright that day. Asked me to undress, so i confirmed if jocks were coming off too, yes please take them off as she stood in the room, face down and off we go. Mildly soft relaxtation massage, full body, as she got to the legs she put a towel between my legs, maybe because first visit didnt want to give a bad impression.

Last leg had me turned on my back with towel over, curtains were weak so the sunlight was shining in my eye, couldnt relax, so at the end of session advised her to put a small towel over clients eyes to ease the brightness.

Time was up, no hints of anything so i just asked if anything was on offer, hr for $30, i didnt even bargain, probably will be my last time i visit. Was a sensual hr, no rush at all, got me over, quick clean with wipes, there is also shower services available.

If it was like a deep tissue kind of massage i would be coming back but i wouldnt come back for a relaxtion. I miss Jenny from Williaton with the strong hands, as for the ML for those who care, just a small middle aged chinese lady nothing extravagant.

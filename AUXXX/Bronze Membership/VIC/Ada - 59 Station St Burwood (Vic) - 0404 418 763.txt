Value for money/recommend? : No, stay away!!

My experience/comments : Booked a spot for this place... went inside and was slightly shocked.

Was greeted by a not so great looking owner (quite plump and boyish looking) who asked me if I wanted a massage? At this point I had second thoughts about my booking because I was praying she wouldn't be the one to give me the massage! Noticed another girl sitting on the couch who was slightly older but decent looking. I mentioned I called previously and she said Oh okay. Locanto? I said yes and she took me to the first room.

Now the rooms are barely even rooms. They are more like partitions, so you can hear what is going on in other rooms and the owner talking outside. Non the less, thought to myself I'll try enjoy it.

Asked how much for extras, and was simply told 'Yes'... ok....Paid $75 upfront for massage first, then the session started.

Massage was decent... but not very strong; had to ask for harder. Lots of oil, but basically got boring and was just waiting for the flip. Finally she flipped me and said; HJ $20. Okay.... getting steep but whatever. Tried to touch her small ass but she said 'no', $20 dollars to touch. Now up to $120.... but damn, was soo bored I just paid it.

Fingers tickled her pussy and breasts, but she just smiled awkwardly as she tried to furiously finish me off. Felt soo ripped off I held it in as long as I could. Eventually the owner said to her, 'time's up' and I hadn't even finished. She told me to 'be quick', so I let it go.

Would never go back; stay away. Pictures are obviously no where near what you get.

I've been to this place several times before and the feeling was up and down. It depends on the lady, if you met good one like Helen or May, you will be very please but some were very boring.

What a pity you did not post any reviews so that we would know why you feel that way.

Person's Name : Ada

Establishment : Massage Therapy

Date of Visit : 11/11/15

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 59C station street, burwood

Hours of Business : 10am - 8:30pm

Rates : $50/30min

Age : looks very young from a far but up close around the 30yo mark

Size/shape : petite, size 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : massage, RnT

Value for money/recommend? : ok, massage is just passable and if you hand over more than $30 for extras then you've been ripped off.

My experience/comments : 
From the outside it looks reasonable and fairly legit premises but once you enter into the front room to what you would consider the reception area you realize this is a dodgy as can be. The front room where you are greater by what I expect is the owner/operator is only furnished by a small devider where a girl is sitting on the floor with bags and food surrounding her. 
Seems a very automated place, walk in, straight away asked how long, in, out, next customer. Ada seemed pleasant enough, very softly spoken and didn't talk much until right at the end just before I left. Massage wasn't the worst and the extras weren't too bad. I think she likes being complimented as she initially didn't allow any touching but by the end she was a lot more relaxed and playful. 
I agree with the first post that the rooms are ordinary, the one I had was makeshift and I could hear what was happening next door through the walls. There's also a large gap in the wall above the door so anyone in the shop could hear what was going on if you made to much noise. The place is nothing special and would only return out of desperation. Much nicer places to try in the area.

I would also add that this place's entry is not discrete - Visited about half five one evening and by the time my 45 minutes were up there were families  dining at the restaurant next door al fresco on the footpath, almost right outside the shop door. That set a new high water mark on the melboy's walk-o-shame meter let me tell you!

Not that I would recommend going there anyhow - it is not awful, but is below average shop with below average girls (based on my two visits where nothing worth reporting here happened ).

This shop has been taken over by the hong kong massage shop at bourke st melbourne.  The hong kong massage advertisement is all over this shop now.  The wonderful world of cut n thrust massage shop takeovers

This shop has had another name change to Reborn "R" Massage, with a neon sign flashing " book now".  Let's hope it has more tricks up its sleeve, than Hong kong massage, which had no takers

When this shop is closed, it has multiple neon signs flashing, there operating hours, there mobile phone number, and a message telling us all to book now.  It must be popular based on these messages, or desperate.

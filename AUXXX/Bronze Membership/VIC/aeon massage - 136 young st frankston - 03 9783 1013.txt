My experience/comments :I was looking for an old regular from Wild Jasmine who i heard had opened a shop in frankston ,me being early a few hadn't opened yet I saw a new shop near the roundabout and after a few laps to get a parking spot nearby as i am not walking to good because of a ruptured Achilles I went in. I was greeted by a very attractive lady about 30 ish,I asked if she was only girl there and she said another young girl available. , so i said ok as i couldn't be bothered walking to other shops. I get taken into a small room and get ready and in comes Baby .very nice tall Chinese girl with glasses and says it her first day,but she has been working in the CBD for a while. the cream has been warmed up ,nice touch on a cold morning,and baby starts at the front of the table and rubs my neck and shoulders, she had her shirt tied up to reveal her belly button,so i gave her a tickle there and she giggles and says you want extra, of course and wants money first so she brings me my trousers,she wanted 50$ for topless and i laid straight on my back .She started to blow air onto the top of my now hard dick,it feels great touching ever so lightly,she has done this before . after my last few punts with jackhammer experts .it was bliss ,she continues for about 20-30 minutes of this and i explode..great job. a new shop very clean and tidy with a pretty boss lady worth a shot.AS i was leaving a lady in the street asked me if i enjoyed my massage,i said of course and she started laughing..cheers

Yes. When I got the message about services and rates it was basically a repeat of the add with 'services Oral Massage' replaced with 'sex oral massage'

The location is surprising, practically at the intersection and although the outside of the house looks like an old shoddy Broadmeadows shithole, the inside was nicely furnished and clean. 

You can't always judge a book by it's cover, so I suggest guys should take a punt rather than flame without checking the place out. 

I haven't been back yet, but I intend to.

Hey guys I've been overseas for a few years so wasn't able to post any reviews here but I just came back and am staying in Glenmore at the moment. I am originally from sydney.

Now I think there's 2 massage parlors here, ones entrance is on Pascoe Vale rd and the other is on the backside where coles is. I went to the one where coles is, she had a chalk board outside with a special advertised $30 for 30 mins so I thought why not try it out.

Her name is Mary, about 5'5" Chinese I think.. not sure. Anyway, lay down on the table and she gave a very good massage would rate it a solid 9.5/10. I kept waiting for a sign of some TT or something but it never came and on the turnover she massaged the front side very well aswell being careful not to touch the little fella .. after 35 mins she said "finished!!" so I thought I may aswell ask her myself and said you don't do extra's? And she replied with a stern no..

All in all it was a very good and much needed massage after a long 36 hour trip back to aus and I didn't bother to research it beforehand either just thought I'd go in and take my chances but no luck (YMMV) but if I'm ever in need for a real proper massage I will definitely be heading to this place.

Sorry I didn't use the template as i haven't been on the forum for a while now and am writing this off my phone.. next time I will try out the massage parlor where the entrance is from pascoe Vale rd and will let you guys know how I went

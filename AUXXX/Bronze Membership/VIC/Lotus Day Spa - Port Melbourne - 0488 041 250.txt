My experience/comments : Was a bit surprised to see Paula walk in, because all the other girls I've been with in this place were asian. Gave a good massage with a lot of pressure on back and shoulders. HJ was really great, unrushed and lots of teasing. She didn't specify an amount, just said "that will cost extra", so I left her a good tip at the end. Pretty good experience overall. I did not enquire if anything more than hj was available, ymmv.

They used to be in Collins Street, but they only moved to Elizabeth Street one or two weeks ago. The number I listed goes to the Elizabeth Street place.

Just had a look at their website. The address there hasn't been updated yet. I just got a business card with details for the new place the last time I went to the Collins Street branch.

Definitely Lotus Day Spa. They moved around from Collins Street. Same boss (Nikki). She has about 7 places. Hasn't updated her website in years though.

The plot thickens... Or continues or something. 
To submit one of my infrequent (sorry fartichoke et al) reviews, I popped by here at 9pm. 

No sign of a parlour, no access after hours to the lift lobby and on ccrossing the street - no lights on in the upper floors. 

I think this one either too complicated, or a dud. Thanks Iva for trying to point out a place, but these guys are hard to track down.

Edit> fix stupid autocorrect error

edit 2> there also didn't appear a day spa on the building directory

They need to fix up their website because since they moved they haven't been open late. It's definitely there, but not open at 9PM. Probably not open at 8PM. It's an office building and the main door is locked around 6 so only access after that is to ring them.

 94 Elizabeth St
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Jenny

Establishment : 94 Elizabeth St (unsure of name)

Date of Visit : April 9 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business : Visited at 8.45pm

Rates : $50.00 for 30 min + extras

Age : 18 (not sure exactly, but young)

Size/shape : slim, busty

Nationality or Ethnicity : asian

Services Provided : naked hj

Value for money/recommend? : probably 

My experience/comments : 

Had been out for a couple of drinks with work mates (and was probably a bit drunk), and was heading to Flinders st to get the train home. Was walking down Elizabeth St, and this place popped into my mind after reading reviews recently. Searched the forums for the phone number, gave a call, and was told to come on up and to buzz if the door was locked. 
The entry to the building from the street was still open, so walked in and got the lift up no worries.
The receptionist was chubby, and eating her dinner. Asked me for how long - 30 min please - and lead me to the room. I was hoping she was not going to be massaging me, but i was there, so what the hell, strip off and lie down. 
Now, I must have had a bit more to drink than I thought, as I thought it would be a good idea to lay face up (no - I don't know why I thought that was a good idea...)
Anyway, in walks Jenny (could have been Jenifer), and wow! Reminded me of a Japanese anime school girl. Smiles at me, asks what kind massage - nice one please - and suggests i turn over. So I do.
She begins a great massage, and after about 5 min, starts playing with me from behind. I lift my hips so she has easier access and she goes for it. 5 min later I turn over. She asks what I would like? I ask how much for naked relief, and she says $50. Yup! She strips off, (leaving on her super sexy g-string), revealing the most perfect breasts with the perfect tiny nipples. Lets me suck them while tugging me. She pushed me back onto the table, places one knee on the table and grabs my hand and places it on her pussy. As i start rubbing her through her g string, she unties it from the sides and it falls off. Now i can feel how wet she is. Wow, this feels great. She continues pulling me while i rub her, and very quickly i finish. She giggles, I just lay there like an idiot.
Anyway, she quickly dresses, and pops out to get some towels to finish cleaning me up. 
I take a quick look t the clock, and its been 22 min since the massage started. I don't think I'll complain about being short changed on this one. I was one very satisfied customer. 
Don't know when or how often Jenny works there.


Would I return? Yes. 

Cheers,

Nope still going - must have gone by when they were either full house, including reception which may make brauninc happy, or gone home early because no punters.

Here's that review from visit last week

Person's Name :  Helena

Establishment : AS above - Lotus Day Spa 

Date of Visit : 3/6/2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 94 Elizabeth St (address correct) - Melb CBD, 0488 041 250

Hours of Business : variable but at least 10-8

Rates :  $50/30m  $70/45m ++

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : busty, slim waist

Nationality or Ethnicity :  Sorry - maybe Thai.  Did not look Chinese/Korean to me.

Services Provided :  RnT HJ 

Value for money/recommend? : Not especially good value for money; somewhat recommended.

My experience/comments : 

Have been meaning to try this place since noticing the thread and doing a "walk by" a couple of weeks back but there was no sigtn of life that time.

Called at 730 - asked for Jenny (based on above) but she was leaving she said and I couldn't get there untiul 815.  She "checked the others" and Helena would stay back.  So it seems the preferred finish time on a weeknight is about 8 but if you call you may be in luck.  Friday night later apparently.

Entrance - a conspicious entrance really, which I'm not usually a fan of - several other places and takeways and traffic waiting for lights etc., but there are multiple businesses in the building so in fact no big deal (I hate the enter off a main drag, massive sign saying "pervs go in here" etc.).  Dialed the place from the keypad at the locked front door ("022" - in fact their literal suite number) and was buzzed in.

Venue - a fairly dingy lift and 2nd flr lobby area led to a bit of a dingy door.  You walk in and are straight in the reectionist's lap.  Which was no bad thing actually - Jenny waiting for a lift I guess.  The entrance is cramped and no real waiting area.  Place is a bit tired but looks clean.  The massage rooms are private with walls to the ceiling - again - tired but clean and warm, dimly lit etc.  Fine really.

Setup:

Introduced to Helena and taken to room, prompted to put my things on a chair.  I asked if it was OK if I was naked and Helena laughed and said OK.  It pays to be polite I reckon, but she wasn't rude probably just surprised.  Took her bloody ages to set up the music on the iPod and I realised she was deliberately stalling because I was slow getting undressed.  Quite discreet of her.

On the table - $70 for 45 min, as I knew.  Very basic massage started when I enquired about additional options on the table - and I suggested $50 might be the go for a nude HJ, same as Jenny.  She said no, and that just a topless HJ would be an extra $70.  I may have left the negotiation a bit late actually because that's nearly a walk but we settled on $50 I think it was for the topless HJ (just happy ending in the end would have been $40)  Still a bit steep but I was there.  She confided when we got a bit more rapport later that she really didn't want to the naked one "this time".  I assume that's either a policy to weed out undesirables, or possible there was a biological reason so being a gentleman I dropped it.  I hate negotiating but was a bit high.  That could be made up for a by a good experience of course.

Massage etc.

The ambience and eventual rapport was quite good (implying Helena is a professional - no grumping about haggling).  The massage though was pretty ordinary - not exactly useless just not very firm or measured.  Sort of like the backrub you might get from a girlfriend.  You may prefer that but having just been to the gym I was actually looking fwd to the massage part.  Never mind.  After a relatively quick period (pun intended) there was some feathery tickling of the undercarriage, followed by something a bit firmer, a flip and some harder work.  Massaging her EXCELLENT breasts was fine with her.  She did do a very teasy thing where it seemed possible she was about to do a non-requested BJ, but she didn't do that nor offer it.  Just a tease.  Kind of cool.  Finished slightly early due to the slightly early flip so after cleanup with warm towels I was offered a shower, whcih I took up.  Probably don't bother - the shower isn't really a client service; seems to be for staff in a room used to store laundry including my recently-used towels.  Unlike a couple of other places I have enjoyed (hi Serenity Crow's Nest; I miss you) - this place doesn't seem to be focussed much if at all on legit clients, so don't expect all that guff.

Everyone was very charming whem I came out and then dressed to leave. Jenny had gone and the plump receptionist was back on deck - Helena saw me out.

WIR?  Yes, probably but would 
1 - maybe ensure Jenny available, although Helena was very decent
2 - negotiate all before hitting the table (novice mistake)
3 - ask for a firm massage (but that may be just me)

I popped in here this thurs to see jenny. They open at 10am but no one was there until 10.45am, closing at 10pm.  The Vietnamese girl gave me nikki's number so I could book jenny for tomorrow.  I rang nikki and she told me jenny hates starting early, and she will contact her to see if we can arrange an 11am for tomorrow. Nikki told me she would ring me back on the phone, but jenny ended up ringing me to confirm the booking.  Great service.  This new shop inside is not to clean to be honest, well in the hall way just past the reception area.  I much preferred the basement arrangement in Collins st which was way more private, but the girls rarely didn't a hj, here theres other businesses on 10 floors and there doing more than straight.    I understand jenny is of Korean decent and the above review of her tickled my loins.

 OK RnT and v good massage at Lotus (Melb CBD)
				
Post Content: 
went back for follow up check

Person's Name : Rita

Establishment : Lotus Day Spa 

Date of Visit : 1/9/15

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 94 Elizabeth St (address correct) - Melb CBD, 0488 041 250

Hours of Business : seems roughly 10am-8/9pm

Rates : $50/30m $70/45m + $50

Age : early 20s

Size/shape : Slim, short

Nationality or Ethnicity : Taiwanese

Services Provided : RnT HJ 

Value for money/recommend? : Basically OK value, other ladies recommended more for RnT

My experience/comments : 

After a decent experience with Helena also keen to see how Jenny rolled, so I thought that I'd go back. 

Rang about 730 and Rita answered phone. She was the only girl on, but I said that would be fine, and headed over. Unfortunately a walk-in grabbed my spott in the  intervening 15 min. To be fair, I guess there may been confusion over who is who, and also bird in hand vs 2 in bush etc. there's a pub round the corner next to the Novotel so I just went for a beer for half an hour. 

Setup

As Rita was the only one on (maybe somebody didn't show up), the room was a bit untidy with towels stuffed in the corner but it was warm and the massage table comfortable, appropriately low lighting so all
L was good. 

Massage

One of my pet hates is a massage that is just a crap massage. I always take 45 or 60 min as I like to unwind and get an actual massage. Rita delivers on that in spades - very good massage she is literally a trained masseuse and the first 25 min was an honest and decent firm massage. Hard work in shoulders - good leg massage. Big tick. There is a downside to an actual masseuse at an RnT but that's discussed below. 

Extras

Avoided rookie mistake in my previous review above and negotiated extras upfront. Told that while some other girls do nude she does not. She also doesn't do true topless but releases bra and allows a little hands on after the flip. This was $50. About par for the course in Melb for that so basically fine. 

As above, excellent massage and just prior to the flip some very good underneath work. Flip and Then successful but a little perfunctory ending but by then I didn't care. I went fairly quickly because her nips hardened a lot, despite the vanilla HJ. Very prompt and thorough hot towel cleanup. 

WIR?

Well, yeah - it was pretty decent with a very good massage. As RnT the other ladies may be slightly better so may depend on your personal preference of the two main elements. .

Value for money/recommend? : bit expensive / not the classiest looking place / girl was sexy though. 

My experience/comments : Found this through wechat, It was on level 2 of the building and I walked up via the stairs passing a hobby shop on the way... might want to take the elevator instead next time. Very small venue, the cashier took my $50 and told me to wait in the massage room. The therapist entered, she was pretty with bleached blonde hair, fit body wearing sports shorts and sandles. I lay on the table face down, still wearing my underwear. She pulled them off and started the massage. It was pretty weak, just lightly rubbing me with oil. The little fella was starting to move though and was poking out the side from under me. She kept brushing past it then asked how much I wanted to spend today. ended up settling on $50 for a hj with her boobs out, could have probably bargained lower with effort. She used sorbolene cream for the hj, it was satisfactory, nothing to write home about. Ended a bit short of the 30 minutes, we talked a little bit and I was on my way.

Age : I guess mid 30s?

Size/shape : Not skinny but not fat...just nice i reckon

Nationality or Ethnicity : Viet

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Umm...yes?

My experience/comments : This place I've visited many times in the past when it was situated opposite the Regent theater. Now that they've moved to this location it's not as posh anymore...feels more like a apartment/studio rather than a massage place. But girls here are generally OK. 

Decided to reward myself for upcoming Christmas and went to this newer establishment to check who was available. 

Walked in and was offered Mims - had that "i want you" look which I liked so paid for the half hour quickie option. 

Into the room, the usual I'll be back business while I strip down to my birthday suit and laid onto the table. 

Mims came back in 10 mins later and offered no towel to cover up - always a good sign! Massage quality was so so - definitely not of a qualified masseuse but it was ok.

Hardly any hint of extras on offer so I decided to take charge - 15 minutes in I asked whether extras were on offer and was quoted $50 for clothed HJ and $100 for nude. 

Prices have definitely gone up in this establishment!!!

Her looks were decent so i gave her a pineapple to get things on the way. 

HJ was decent with varied movements - and plenty of eye contact making the experience mesmerizing at least. Very limited touching on the butt was allowed - nothing else and I didn't push further. 

Finished up with 5 mins left and was shown out the door with a nice smile. 

Will return to check out some other good looking ones I saw on the way out.

My experience/comments : 

Trying to work my way through the roster and trying out the goods. *Receptionist always has her boobs out so I won't mind doing her too!* Was introduced to Chanel - she looked decent but big type of girl, not usually mt type but I thought I'd try it out. 

Standard fare into the room with her leaving me while I undress and plonk on the table. 

Her massage was standard and nothing to shout about. I think she might have seen me in the shop before as she went straight for the Rod without asking, must have known I had been serviced before lol. Only HJ on offer but I didn't ask further for nude so I don't know whether it was on offer.

Pressure was good, okok eye contact which got me over the line. 

Decent punt if you were looking for someone meaty to hold onto?

Date of Visit : 27/01/17

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Beehive building, Level 2, 92 Elizabeth St, Melbourne - 9654 6635

Rates : 30mins / 60

Age : 20s

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

As per my previous post, I think I've already sampled most of the goods at this joint. Today I was introduced to Coco from Taiwan. Cute little number with a nice smile got me hooked and I knew i was in for a good time. 

Coco is of the shy nature, which incidentally are the demeanor of most taiwanese females I think. Maybe it's just me? Anyway, things start out nice and slow and her massage skills was decent. Not too much TT but I was actually quite enjoying the massage and didn't think of taking up any offers (if they were available). 

Even when she didn't try, I could feel the erection growing and she must have sensed it too because there was a 180 degree turn in events. She invited me to flip, and there and then my mast started swaying in the cold wind of the room. No explanations necessary and after a quick negotiation, she went straight to work. 

Good pressure, and I think her shy nature really got me horny and so half the job was done already. I think it took me less than 5 minutes of action to blow, definitely faster than usual. 

She's worth a repeat definitely - and I'll be back to find out what else could be on offer.

Due to her shy nature, I only took what she offered which was a pineapple for a HJ. Light ass touching was allowed and I didn't venture any further as I don't like to test boundaries. 

YMMY if you wanted to push for more?

Value for money/recommend? : errr ok?

My experience/comments :

After my horrible punt at 33 Mackinzie I decided to trek down to the city to see what was on offer at Lotus. 

Was given kiki when i arrive - she looked quite familiar as though I had seen her before somewhere but just can't put a finger on it. Anyway she was decent enough if not slightly old but I had blue balls which needed relief. 

Anyway ushered into the room while she went out like all MLs do - no idea for what. 

Back in 5 with me already naked and on the table - she proceeded to do quite a decent massage which definitely took out some knots. 

A little conversation before light TT began. Negotiations started and $80 was qouted - annoying that this place charges this high prices! BUt like i said I was toey so begrudgingly accepted. 

Her hands felt soft, listened to my directions, fast, slow, solid hold, light featherly touch - all which led to quite a big explosion. 

Not much eye contact unfortunately but she's nice enough to do what I liked. 

Prob worth a return.

Just thought I'd chime in that this shop is no longer based in the CBD - they've moved to Port Melbourne. Number and Wechat is still the same though.

Be wary of the hot decoy. She suckered me right in with that hot photo! Haven't been. Tried the Oakleigh shop once. 50 year old who wanted $50 for a HJ! No thanks.

My experience/comments :

Decided to go the full pint no research, to a wander down bay st port melb and spotted this one.  
Walked in expecting to see some old Thai lady, to my supplier a very good looking Chinese/Korean girl super slim small tittys
Only discused basics time money.
Got nude on the table. Ps. Tissues under the table👍.  Great massage lots of ass rubbing slight ball sack touch's. Turned over and was asked if I want extras, yes please was my answer.  Not rushed at all but straight into it. Nice and slow caressing the whole body with little tickles on the knob.  I'll tell you this girl drives a manual. She is very familiar with the gear stick. Even has her own little massage technique for your knob not just pull it.
I asked her to take her top off.  No problem just said no touching please.
After it was all over.  $30 for the extra
$20 for the top off.  

Would I return:  hell yes, excellent work

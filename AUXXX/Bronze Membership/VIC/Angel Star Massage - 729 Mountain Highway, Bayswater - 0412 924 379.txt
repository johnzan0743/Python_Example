My experience/comments: This parlour stands out from a very busy Mountain Highway (with flashing lights and a light green facade). It is better to use the more discrete back entrance which conveniently leads to an ample back parking lot. 

I have seen Jasmine twice before over long stretches. She is bubbly, has a great smile and a very good figure. She also has a remarkable memory (recalling details of my last visit). 

I went with a 30 min massage for $50. Her massage alternates between a decent medium massage (to get rid of shoulder knots) and a light feathery massage over the legs and buttocks to remind you what’s on offer. 

On the flip she requested another $50 for a naked HJ. Well worth it because she throws in some tit sucking, light lip caresses over the body and a slow sensual HJ. 

To top it all off, you get a great head and face massage afterwards. 

Jasmine isn’t a clock watcher and goes beyond the 30 min service to deliver a satisfying value experience. 

Will I return? Yes, definitely, though I plan to try the parlour a few stores further up and maybe Wild Jasmine (if it isn’t so busy every time I drop in). Would appreciate if anyone has had recent experiences there.

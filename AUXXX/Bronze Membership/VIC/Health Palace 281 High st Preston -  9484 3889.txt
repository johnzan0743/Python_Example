My experience/comments : 

My back was sore and I needed a massage. I went along to Alana Thai, but they were busy, and they have also changed owners, it's now called Cheva Gold.. Any intell with the new owners and what on offer would be great. Pm if you like.

So I walked across to this place, I walked in and asked for half, the lady said $40.. Ok. into the first room on the right, she tells me to strip and lay down.
Not long after in comes Amy, petite not bad looking. She asked me what type of massage, I just said oily one, then I started thinking is she asking about extras at the start of the massage, so I then ask what's on offer? And she begin to tell me.. Traditional Thai, Aromatherapy, relaxation and deep tissue. My bad, so I say traditional.
She first begins with some traditional Thai stretches, I was covered with a towel, but the way she had my legs up and around I'm pretty sure she saw my tackle, the stretchers went on for about 5 min she then removed the towel and begun the massage with oil, it was fantastic and really helped with my sore back.
10 min later she replaces the towel and tells me to turn over, no mention of extras, she continues to massage my legs and inner thighs as she rubs close to my tackle I start to rise, not hard but a enough to suggest what she's doing is making me feel good.
She notices my situation, leans over and asks if I would like being massaged there, so I say yeh.. How much? She says $50, I try and counter with $30 but she says only $50, so I say no.
I would have said yes but to be honest I really only had $30 on me... I told her this too, but she wouldn't budge. 
I will return, I think the massage was value for money but $50 for a handy is a bit steep, that's more than the massage itself.
I'm not sure you  punters, but I've got a budget when it comes to extras.. They are $30 for hj and $50 for topless hj and I'm happy with $70 nude hj, and $50 for cbj, all with touching, I know there are places you can get fs for $70 all up, but that's not my scene..

[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments :


Been looking to write this review up for a while but have been busy lately. was in the city with a few mates till late but felt pretty horny after the night out. Was about 11:30 when we finished up and i remembered about this place i had read about. walked past earlier in the afternoon to see their opening hours and noticed they were open till 2am so i kept that in the back of my mind.

the place is actually in a building that requires you to to take an elevator up to the floor where their shop is, but you have to be buzzed into a glass door at the front. they have a speaker and a button with 'orchid massage' labelled on it for you to press, after pressing it, they'll unlock the door, you then take the elevator up to level 3 or 5 which is their level. 

after exiting the elevator there's a large lounge area with a TV and a small receptionist desk which i approached. considering the time i thinks she was quite surprised, i told her i was there for a massage and she asked how long, i said 1 hr and she said 85. she showed me the room which was a massage room for couples with two stands and i took the closest one. stripped down and waited until a young girl came in and greeted me. she seemed quite shy but immediately began the massage with lots of oil (bit too much) on my back. she proceeded with back to legs and to be honest it was a pretty poor massage. was nothing more than light touching and nothing sensual at that. 

finally the flip came and she began to tease a bit more, rubbing my legs but going over the tackle without hesitation. she stopped and looked at me and said 'you want happy ending?', i said 'how much?' which she respondede $50. i said 'no' and told her that's way too much. unfortunately i was much too horny and tried to haggle with her but she wouldnt budge. i only had 40 on me and told her that's all i had to which she said 'ok you give me 50 next time' which i said i would. the tug was pretty bad as you could tell she just wanted to get me over the line as soon as possible. certainly would not return if $50 is the minimum for a hj.

My experience/comments : 

Came in shortly after they opened for the day, there is an elevator in the foyer of the building that takes you to floor 4. Front desk was deserted and then a hot young (mid 20's) Vietnamese girl pops her head out of an office area to the side.  

I ask for a 30 minute massage and get charged $50 straight up. She leads me to a room with two massage beds but with a door that closes. I strip off after she leaves and then lie down and wait. She comes back in and introduces herself (can't remember the name) and starts the massage, I am felling good as she is hot.  After less than 2 minutes an older lady comes in the room and after some talking in Viet, she explains that the young girl has another booking which just turned up. I am a bit annoyed but don't say no when they say she has to go and do the other booking.

Two minutes later, in pops a mid forties Vietnamese lady called Sonia. She proceeds to give me an average massage and then on the flip, we discuss extras. I negotiate a $40 hj. Sonia takes her top off and undoes the front button of her shorts, I push them down and have a bit of a play with her b to c sized breasts and the outside of her pussy while she tugs away.  

I am still annoyed at the swap so take a bit longer than normal but we get across the line eventually. Sonia leaves me to clean up and seems disinterested and mechanical throughout. 

WIR? Not in a hurry, pretty annoyed at the swap once the massage started and the replacement was fairly lackluster. Prices are good for the city but there are enough alternatives to keep me away for a while.

Anyway, happy punting.

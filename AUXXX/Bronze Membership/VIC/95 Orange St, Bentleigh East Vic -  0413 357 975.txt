Went to see Lucy... Best tits in the r'n'tug game... A good chunky arse too, but slim

Willing to try again, I think she would go all the way without much hesitation

Comments: Hadn't been there for awhile and since it's pretty local popped over. Greeted by mamasan who remembered me and decided i was in the mood for an older lady, so off i went. She has always been very friendly and chatty and soon we were both nuded up and i was on the table. Massage was actually very good, nice and firm and hit some good spots. No Problems with letting my hands play around and some lovely nipple sucking. She worked from head to toe, including some lovely sack and crack play. When it was time for the flip she oiled up mr happy and away she went. Was a little too fast so asked to slow down, continued to play with her pussy while she jerked me. I then asked for DATY, she hopped up on the table, into a 69 position, i licked she jerked and eventually we were both happy! A quick wash down, dressed and off i went. Smile on my face. I still think at $70 for nude and HJ, it's very good value.

Orange St isn't in Monash- the brothel isn't mentioned but it is stated that it is in Oakliegh.
Bentleigh East would fall into Glen Eira's catchment

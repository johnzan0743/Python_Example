Hi all,

I have walked past this place a few times and decided to have a massage (as I legitimately needed one!). 

The girls were all cute with a mixture form Japan and Korea.

Excellent deep tissue massage but no offer of anything else.  Can anyone let me know if they have any other experiences there?

thanks

Hi Fartichoke,

I have bronze membership now, is it ok to post this?

I'm not putting up a review, just want some feedback on the place from others.

thanks :-)

I went here a couple of weeks ago and saw a older Korean girl.

Massage was the best I've had. Legit place and don't offer any extras.

The massage was so relaxing, I nearly fell asleep lol

This place is in china town yeah? I've been here twice recently and got extras both times. Once by the older lady who I think is the owner, quite nice though and second time by a young girl who claims to record the name and cock size of all her clients and she got her top off. Both times cost me $30 extra, plus $20 for the topless part., I would go again for sure

I dropped by today for a legit massage (as I have always had great massages there).  Previously, no extras were offered, however, today I was offered extras ($50 for topless HJ) but declined as the masseuse didn't do it for me (older lady with long blondish hair...but tubby, her name is Jessica)

My experience/comments :Was browsing locanto and this came up, i liked the sound of a 4 hand massage to texted and sorted out a time....texts where overtly flirty so i thought it was a a good start.
Walked in, "you book for double?", yes!  Paid the money and was taken to a room that was sooooo small there was no way a good massage was ever going to be possible.
Massage starts with one girl...hmm..."other girl be 2 minutes"!
At least 5-10 minutes later she comes and they have a good old foreign chat across my body...fukcing realxing...NOT
Dead set I think a wet fish would do more, the massage was shit and the tug at the end, $30 for one girl, $50 for both (i was in the room with both so went the double).  
I have to say it was just weird, I will not return and I do not recommend....unless you like weird and a massage from a wet fish!

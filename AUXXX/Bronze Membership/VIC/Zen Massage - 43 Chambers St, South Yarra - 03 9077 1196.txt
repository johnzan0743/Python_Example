Person's Name : Jen

Establishment : Zen Massge

Date of Visit : Feb 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 43 Chambers St South Yarra

Hours of Business : 11-8 ( I think)

Rates : $50/60/70 for 30/45/60 Minutes 

Age : 24

Size/shape : Short size 8 sexy shapely

Nationality or Ethnicity : Cambodian

Services Provided : Massage & HJ

Value for money/recommend? : If all you want is a decent clothed massage & HJ, yes 

My experience/comments : Haven't been to Chambers St  in a while and decided it was time to re-acquaint.  Walked in on a reasonably warm day in Melb and was was pleasantly surprised at the optics in front of me and was very keen to get my gear off. Jen is short and very nice c cuppers with a low plunging top.

Started with a massage which was actually really quite good. Jen had a lovely touch, so I broke my own rule of only booking 30 minutes on the first date and changed to an hour ... and handed over another 50 and asked for 30 change ... wink wink 

Before long her strokes were getting more and more sexy and ventured inside my crack which brought on the expected response of pleasurable moaning from me. She asked me if I wanted extra's to which I replied - yes please - All that was on offer was a HJ, no CBJ, no nude (damn) just an HJ and no sense that recurring visits would yield anything further.

After agreeing to the $30 extra for HJ, the money was already in place from the change earlier and she went to work while I was still in the prone position. The crack rubs got deeper and even included some date rubbing. Under the scrote and round the legs .. I was in heaven. I wanted to turn over so I could see Jen as well .. I knew this was going to be a big blow. 

Jen has a fabulous, but not in the same league as Maggie (you know who I mean), style which is really warms you up and gets more and more intense as she takes you on the journey. After blowing a major load, she cleaned me up and then provided a bit more leg massage before going to get hot, too hot, towels.

Jen is a very cute Cambodian, quite dark skinned and great tits that I will never get anywhere near. She doesn't want you to touch her either unless you pay her $50 and that is just outside touching which I thought was a bit rich ... thankfully her style is good enough to carry her through.

Sorry boys, My apologies as I thought there was only one, that being Victoria but apparently there's one in SA as well.

There is one in NSW too and there has an RAAF airbase there and it was freezing place in winter in the 1960s.

Yes it was $50 all up. Pretty good value me thinks. On the Williamstown subject there is a subtle difference in the spelling of the NSW one, as it is actually RAAF Williamtown.

True the base is called RAAF Williamstown but there is a suburb as well, with houses for sale too. see Real Estate & Property For Sale.in Williamtown, NSW 2318 (Page 1) - realestate.com.au

My experience/comments :

Saw a few reviews about this place on another website, so decided to check it out. While this is a massage shop, it provides all the necessary extras. 

Went in an an old Thai hag greeted me. Said her name was Joy and that it was "her turn". I thought to myself, i don't give a rat's ass if its your turn, you are not touching me! I said, well that's good to know, who else is working. She said Vicky and one more name which I couldn't remember. I had seen a pretty positive review of Vicky, so decided to ask to see her.

Vicky took me to the room and asked me what i wanted to do. "everything", i said, and handed over $100 for half an hour which is meant to be fully inclusive here. she giggled and left the room for me to undress, and I could hear her through the walls repeating what I said to the other girls in another room.

Anyway, back comes Vicky and undresses to reveal a fucking hot and lithe body. She's tall, probably 5'7 or 5'8, C-D sized breasts which had clearly had some artificial attention, and a completely flat toned body. looks wise she looks quite pleasant, with a typical thai face. 

The encounter started with her Vicky going down while I sat on the side of the massage table. Her blowjob skills are nice, she had me nice, hard and steaming very very quickly, and I was ready to blow pretty soon. I informed her about it and she said, that's okay babe, you can come twice if you like. Bingo, I thought to myself and proceeded to let loose, unloading into the rubber while still in her mouth. Fantastic feeling.. would have been even better if there was no rubber! ;-)

I lay down while Vicky cleaned me up, and proceeded to give an average massage. About 15 mins of this and I turned around to start receiving some more attention. Vicky rolled on the rubber and went at little mboggler again. This girl certainly has a few tricks up her sleeve, as her technique of sucking and light biting at the base of the shaft soon had me at full mast, honestly much faster than I expected. She lay down on the massage table, while I stood at the side with her legs apart and slid inside her tight pussy. Boom boom we went for about 5 mins, and I just had to finish in doggy. She was more than happy to serve, and a few more minutes later exploded once more, a happy man.

Cleaned up and was on my way. Can't think of better value for $100 to be honest.

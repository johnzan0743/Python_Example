My experience/comments :

Drove up to Essendon and walked in without booking. When I got there was a medium size Chinese girl with black shoulder length hair. She was good looking with tee shirt and tiny shorts showing off her lovely legs.

 After paying my $45 up front she took me to a room where I stripped off and waited for her.

 I asked how long had she been working here and she said she just started 2 weeks earlier.

 She started on my back with a very good massage. She didn't mind me touching her legs as she massaged me.

 As she worked my legs she kept touching the tackle so things were looking good.

 Then she asked me to flip over and I turned over with a boner she could see I wanted more.

 I asked her if she had extra and said a hand job for $30.

 I said yes and she continued to massage my chest and legs before she started on the little guy. She grabbed him and gave me nice long strokes of the shaft and help my balls.

 Before long she burst me and squeezed every last drop out of him.

 She the cleaned me very well with hot towels and gave me a head massage before the session ended.

 Overall very happy with service and price.

 Happy Punting.

Suspect I already know the answer to this, but are any of the three chicks in the photos Dora?

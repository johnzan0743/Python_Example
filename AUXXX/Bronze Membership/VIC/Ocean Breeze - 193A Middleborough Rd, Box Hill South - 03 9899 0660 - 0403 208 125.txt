My experience/comments:

So, doing a bit of searching and texting on locanto got me introduced to this joint.  I called ahead and they were available.  I walked in, paid 65 to the girl at the desk and was shown to the room.

Stripped down and got on the bed.  No heater and the music was a bit interesting.  Shortly 'Kelly' came in.  Jeans and t-shirt, long hair, pretty face and nice looking body.  Tried talking to her but she seemed kinda fake.  All the answers she gave me felt like lies.  Asking anything further and she would just stop talking.  Oh well, she gave a good medium soft massage.  Didn't hit the right spots all the time but definitely had smooth silky hands.  

She was clearly experienced.  When she went to the leg area, she didn't play too much with the tackle but did have smooth, ling strokes down and up the legs to the butt.

On the flip she continued her long strokes and knew that the little brother was interested.  She asked whether I wanted some help.  I nodded and she started slowly twisting up and down the shaft.  Adding a bit more lube, and not long after, I blew my load and she cleaned me up.

She continued to give me a good massage afterwards but the lack of real conversation almost makes me wanna try someone else.  

If you want a looker, definitely give her a try, I asked her what days she worked but she didn't say.   Again, another vague conversation.

Thank you for your post blueonion.

How long did you spend with Kelly ?

Given that she was reluctant to speak, how did you negotiate for the HE ?

My experience/comments : Met Yoyo at reception area then followed her to one of the rooms.  Nice enough setup.  Requested medium strength massage which was performed well.  Approx half way through asked for soft and then the teasing began.  Enquired about extras and was ok with $50 for topless and hand relief.   
Nice friendly girl with a good attitude.  Highlight was she did some nipple sucking on ME to help me get across the line

Person's Name : Kim

Establishment : Unnamed shop front

Date of Visit : March 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0403 208 125 (Locanto)

Hours of Business : 9am to 8pm most days of the week

Rates : $70 / half hour

Age :  20 to 24

Size/shape : 12, good size breasts

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage & hand relief

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, I enjoyed the visit even though it seemed a bit dodgy when I walked in.

My experience/comments : I called this shop back in March and dropped in for a massage... it doesn't look like much from the outside and I even missed the door the first time past too. And when I walked inside the front was like a lounge room for 'off duty' entertainment.

I was ushered to a room where I could change out of my clothes and put the towel on, and in walks one of the two girls from out front to give me a massage. I would describe her as early 20s, good english, great tits and she even let me have a feel after I did the turn over.... pretty good experience in all.

It has been over 12 months since a review here so as I was driving down Middleborough Rd I detoured into the car park. Went to the door to see a handwritten not saying shop closed until 4th August. Reason given 'Travelling' 

Obviously gone home to see mum and dad

Wol...must return after that date as they will be looking to rebuild their bank accounts.

Its been shut for many months, but if its re opening, it reminds me of the zombie that keeps getting knocked out, and coming back to life, they never die these shops

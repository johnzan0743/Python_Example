The address is 116 Canterbury Rd and the shop is located near a newsagent. Lisa and Linda are good, but stay away from Anna. She provides a massage akin to the torturer from the Spanish Inquisition. Look forward to your review after your visit.

I wandered in last week and had a mild success. It was a Wednesday at 10:30am, the girls name was Nana. I reckon she would have been about 30. Took the half hour option for $45, she mentioned she was hot (it was a hot day) so I suggested she undress, without success. She didn't mind wandering hands but couldn't get any clothing off her. Eventually push came to shove and for $30 she offered a RnT but I was denied for HJ and anything else. She did a pretty good job though. Guess it depends on the girl and the day. 

My overall impression of the place is that there is better elsewhere. The cubicles are pretty small and there is not much in the way of privacy as they are not very sound proof and you get to hear everything else happening in the place.

i had tried to get a walk in to the new Nu Mee(spelling) shop which had been reviewed here, but the lady on reception said she was too busy. I had noticed 1418 had reopened, and since it was getting late I thought I would give this place a go as I had used to be a regular of the previous shop before it was shut down.
upon entering I was greeted by Lilly, a plump Chinese lady. She was the only girl working, I thought about leaving but given the hour, I would be lucky to find anywhere else so went ahead. 
Was led into a dimly lit room and left to undress.
she returned and commenced an OK massage, nothing out of this world. There was slight teasing towards the end and on the flip she asked if I wanted extras, which I agreed to a clothed HJ. Had a chat with her whilst getting dressed and she mentioned that she hardly does extras, the main bulk of the business being a straight up massage.
I probably won't return here again.

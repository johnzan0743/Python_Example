My experience/comments : 

Long story short, forget it unless you want a legit non sexual massage.

I was walking past on a dismal Sunday night. I had just left a dud joint very dissatisfied and still in need of an empty out.

It must have been about 9.30pm and I was surprised to see anything open. This place had an open sign on the door.

The only dodgey thing about this place was that it was actually open. The whole place looked upmarket and spotlessly clean.

I ventured inside and a very attractive, but offhanded, receptionist asked me what I wanted. In our limited conversation I settled on 30 mins for $45.

Before handing over the dosh, I specifically asked her if she was doing the massage and she said yes. She eagerly took my money. As she pushed her chair back, I noticed she was quite pregnant. Oops I must be on my best behaviour.

She made me sit on a couch for about 10 mins, then a PYT appears & directs me to a 5 star massage room. She says her name is Lisa and leaves me to get changed.

There was a subtle sign in dark print explaining the need to keep undies on & blah blah but no actual sexual disclaimer.

I ignore the sign. Well it would be easy to miss it. Eventually Lisa appears, and covers my whole body with a huge fluffy towel.

She spends a long time massaging me over the towel.
The small talk has stopped. She is not in the mood. Then she progresses to massaging body parts. Her MO is to expose only what she is massaging and then cover it up and move on to the next body part. At no stage what so ever did she go anywhere near the good stuff.

She was very professional, and I was bored shitless. 

Eventually, she indicates time is up by asking me if I would like to extend my time. I flipped myself over & asked what is involved. She basically implied just more of the same. 

I did not want to offend her, but I don't want to die wondering. So I politely asked the question. She politely informed me that the answer was no.

So once again it was out into a blistering cold Melbourne Sunday night. Still horny, still relying on slow public transport, and time is on the march.

I need a sure thing to empty my bags. Can I make it to Ping's before Kelly closes ?
Review to follow.

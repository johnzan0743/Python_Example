My experience/comments : She's been reviewed her before and I've had Janet a few times now, she does provide a good massage, but to be honest I think Lek (another massuese there provides a better massage if that is what you're looking for). There's something about this place, where you have a shower first, don on a robe then wait to be escorted into the rooms. Anyhow massage is okay, and Janet does this thing where she, massage's your balls before the flip as a bit of teaser, which certainly gets the mood going. She certainly doesn't budge on price, so its definitely 50 for a HJ, I've also had a CBJ from her before but not this time ($100). There are places that are cheaper, but I like this place because its generally clean and they change the towels!

My experience/comments : Went to a second massage parlour after the first one I visited today from another review, I was satisfied by the first as I said in the first review but I wanted to see if I could get anything extra from this one. Paid for half an hour again this time, was told to wait in a room for 5-10 minutes. 15 minutes later, still no one. I was standing there naked, finally the young receptionist girl enters, tells me girl will be 5 more minutes. She was not surprised by my nudity, good sign. I can hear a ML and another punter in the next room talking and laughing, I wonder if this is the only girl on at the moment. Finally she comes in and introduces herself, asks me if I have been here before. She then instructs me to lie down and gives me a very good massage, she whispers in my ear and promises me she will give me a very relaxing massage. I didn't come for the massage but I really enjoyed it and found it very satisfying. She did not play with my bum much like the other girl I saw earlier today but there was a bit of teasing here and there which I enjoyed, and finally when she told me to turn over she wasted no time pulling on my cock, she asked if I wanted her to finish me off while slowly stroking it and I said yes thinking it would be free since she already started, but she asked "How much you give me" and foolishly I said "50" where I could have negotiated. Oh well I'm still relatively new to the game so I will work on that, I came soon after as her technique was really slow and sensual, no fake moaning no rushing, she was really good.

My experience/comments :

is my go to place during break.

Nice relaxing environment, is a bit run down but is also value for money especially if off peak times.

Met a new lady, named Ting, small petite little thing with decent sized breast

Gave me a quick hand job before giving me a proper oil back, leg and head massage.

Wasn't really much of a talker, time flew although it was an hr.

She definitely has enough strength to give me the hard massage I need.

I will probably see her again next pay day. J

$55 for the hour massage seems reasonable, how much for the extras?

I also had a poor experience here. Probably the worst massage I've ever encountered, literally felt like she was poking my back. Worst part was she kept talking about heaps of crap and didn't even offer extras. She also left the room several times to welcome new customers. You'd expect they'd at least add some extra time on your massage but this is never the case! 

WIR - not likely

Nice1bruva, if was a recent session (within the last 3 months) you should make a Review rather than these comments that I notice you seem to do a lot of since your three earlier reviews.

Yep, sure. I just thought it was a bit of a double up doing a whole new review for a crap experience, but I will do them from now on.

My experience/comments :

It was one of those places that you pass by and not really take a second look to see if may be an rnt place. So i went in one Friday afternoon and was met by Angela., a bit large young chinese girl. I generally dont go by looks cos they all have some unique talent..she got me lying on the table and started with a firm massage. it was good she started to work on my back and slowly move to the butt and the legs . she took her time on the arse and gently running her finger in the crack and pulling on the balls as she kept going..down the legs..i started to touch her on her legs and move my hand up..and she figured i'd be game..then came the flip..and she looked at me and pointed to the crotch and said..massage..and asked for 30 ..i asked her to take off her top..for 50..and she did so ..while oiling my cock and giving it a nice tug while i sucked her tits..her crotch was a no go zone..so had to be happy with what i got..so all up..good massage and hj...tits were ok..

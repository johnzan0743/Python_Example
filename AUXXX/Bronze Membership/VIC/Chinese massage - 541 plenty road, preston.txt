My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

I believe this is newly opened and I only noticed it driving through. So I'm unable to provide any contact details/weblink.

As I entered, the door chimes went off and you would have to wait at the second door.

A minute later, a lady named Apple answered and ushered me into the first room and asked what I wanted?

I asked what did you offer? She replied. Sex $100, Blowjob $70 and Handjob $50.

I negotiated for a Boobjob and Handjob for $50, Told her I'll only take 15 minutes. After I handed over the money, she asked me to undress and that she will be a moment.

Upon her return, she just grabbed my dick and started giving it a nice handjob till I said, what about the boob job?
So she attempted to wrap her B cups around me and give me a dry boobjob? WTF!!!! 
I had to ask her to stop and say get some oil. 

As she covered the D in oil, I then got back into position for her to let me slide between her tits and she responds no? It's got oil! I'll just give you hand job? 

I know it was too late to ask for my money back and I just wanted to get out of there so It took about 5 minutes to blow with her fake moaning baby baby baby while watching her security camera screen on the corner.

Def will not return and I suggest neither of you give this place a punt.

Ethanle, is there a visible security camera looking at you and the girl doing the business? I know there are probably many joints with them but in all my visits to many different venues I have never seen one, not to say they are not there, but certainly not visible in my experience.

This is Apple I believe from 179 Plenty Rd Preston. She said she going to a new place up the road earlier last month. The fake "baby, baby baby" is very off putting!

Sorry what I meant to say was that there was a monitor in the room. Where she could watch who was coming in and out

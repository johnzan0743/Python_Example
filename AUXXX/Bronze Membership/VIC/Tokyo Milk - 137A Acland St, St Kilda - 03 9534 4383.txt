Thanks for the heaps up Japan  
I got a thing for wog/arab/Mediterranean women. 
But with these prices it's definitely not making me head down in any hurry. 

I've seen Andrea from Thomastown & Tracy from 300 bell st recently and will do some reviews.

Post Content: 
Person's Name : Sasha

Date of Visit : Mar 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :  137A Acland St, St Kilda

Hours of Business : 10am-10pm 7 days a week.

Rates : $50 for 1/2 hour  +$80 HJ/nude

Age : Early 20s

Size/shape : Size 10, natural C cup 

Nationality or Ethnicity : French

Services Provided : Massage, R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Booked for 1/2hr and was told someone was just finishing up. Not sure what her name was and was asked to wait in a sitting room for 5-10mins. After that was taken to a massage room and got ready, shortly after a nice looking girl comes in and introduces herself as Sasha. She seemed nice enough and started the massage which seemed ok considering the room was fairly small and not much room to move. After a few mins she asked what was I after explained it, although not much, she said HJ and nude $80. I felt that was too expensive and we settled on $60. She was great and took her time not being a clock watcher, anyways finished up paid and left.

Planter not going to get into a war with u coz im an IDGAF kinda guy, 
But for some of us punting takes planning and timing especially with a Gestapo 
Hard to make an excuse to go to areas where work or home is not near by. 

I assumed the boys on here were here to help and give feedback on punts. 

I will be making the effort to see this sasha based not only on ur review but others too. 
And considering she is leaving soon I need to make plans quick.  
I do hope I get the same treatment as u did and hopefully better who knows...  

Till then keep it cool, keep punting and reviewing coz I did enjoy ur story on sasha.

Gees, how many French chicks do they have at this shop? Unfortunately I get paid Saturday and Kaya is working Wednesday-Friday this week. SO gotta wait an extra week for this goddess.

But booked another French babe for this saturday. Anyone know who she might be? Would like to see a possible review on her before I go this saturday so I know what she might be like in her bookings.

Now, let me see, that's $65 plus $120 = $185 for 45 minutes for a nude tug. Up the other end of the street, Linda and Cici will give you 30 minutes of nude HJ, BJ, FIV, DATY etc etc etc for the $65 only. OK, I'm sure the milky girls are sweeter and cuter, but that's still a pretty healthy pay scale they are on!

Thought to Google Australia Backpackers Massage and got this:

Looking For Female Massage Therapists In Melbourne at nurturing therapy, Victoria | Backpacker Job Board

We are a a Lomi Lomi style Massage Parlour based in Kew, looking for english speaking, local or international female therapists (preferably with Massage background but can train if necessary.) Must be friendly, open-minded, warm and welcoming. 

If you have been to the upstairs shop at Kew Junction, you will doubtless have met such open-minded, not necessarily trained young ladies.  I guess Tokyo Milk is "same same"

Well enjoy your low scale enjoyment. Mint Euro ladies request $120 for nude enjoyment. Doable considering todays minimum wage. These days, the 'mint' asian ladies now request $100 for nude hand relief. And I doubt it very much it is only $65 for massage and the rest of the deal.

Either way, I look forward to your review on this other joint

 Alana - Tokyo Milk
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Alana

Establishment : Tokyo Milk

Date of Visit : 10th April 

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 137a Acland St, St Kilda 

Hours of Business : 11am to 11pm

Rates : $50 half $80 hr

Age : 25

Size/shape : petite, sexy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Eurasian

Services Provided : Nude Massage/Hj

Value for money/recommend? : Yes and No

My experience/comments : 

I was having dinner and drinks with some colleagues down the road and was thinking I would check this place out. I haven't been here since it opened! The last girl I saw was Vietnamese and want $50 Hj. Back then I was getting FS for the same money. No different to last night when I think about it.

Made my way upstairs. I still had my discount card funny enough with one stamp. I asked who was available. A choice of an Aussie girl, or Eurasian. I liked the sound of the Eurasian and made a booking sight unseen. The receptionist showed me to the room and I undressed and lay on the table waiting.

A few minutes later Alana showed up. She was wearing some kind short shorts and a tight top. A very sexy look about her. The way she moved I just wanted to fuck her. I kept staring at her cute face, which made her think I wanted to go with someone else. I said no I was just admiring how cute she looked.

Down to business and Alana's massage technique was actually quite decent. She moved to the head of the table very close. Rubbing her boobs over my back. I rubbed my hands up and down her smooth, soft legs at the same time. Lots of flirting, chatting and sexy touches. I was building up pressure from under the table.

She must have noticed I was getting horny and mentioned if I was interested in any extras. She offered a nude body slide with HJ for $100. A little pricey and I know I can have full service at Red Lantern for less money. I agreed, as you do when your cock is raised at full attention.

Alana left her corset on, stripping off and jumped the table. She started grinding on my cock and was so close to my lips without contact. I rubbed her soft pussy with my finger, as I put both of her breasts in my mouth. She kept grinding and dry fucking me, until she lay next to me and jerked me off to completion.

We chatted some more and found out about her family and background. Overall it was a great experience, even though I paid a little bit too much. It was only half an hour for $150 all up.

Not sure if I would go back for that sort of money.

Rating 8/10

 Just reading the review of Eva at Essential Elements Hawthorn. For very similar service (very erotic nude HJ) Eva was charging $120 all up for 90 mins!!  Worth the bus fare from St Kilda

25 mins at the lantern will get me FS/nude/HJ/shower for $100. My last visit I paid $110 and got BBBJ/DFK/DATY as well. No more rip off RnT shops for me. I have seen hotter looking girls at Red Lantern. 

As for the girl I saw here. She kept her corset on the entire time and I paid for nude! I got the impression she was trying to hide part of her body. She also dry fucked me through the towel. The handjob was like a jack hammer. Not sensual. A real tease with her almost touching my lips, but not actually kissing.

Anyway it was a $150 lesson for me. They say you should never go food shopping when you're hungry.

$100+ is the going rate for stunners these days, we punters MUST get used to paying for quality and if we refuse to? we can just go book a 5/10 lady and pay $70-$80 for the same thing elsewhere.

This shop only hires european back packers with the very odd execption. Don't think I have ever seen a rank looking therapist there. All above average to hot looking im ny opinion.

Who decides the going rate at RnT? As my post earlier there are hot looking girls at Red Lantern for less $$$. You make up your own mind on who to visit for your $. If you are only into Euro girls look at Club859. FS $140 for 30 mins all up. Hot girls.

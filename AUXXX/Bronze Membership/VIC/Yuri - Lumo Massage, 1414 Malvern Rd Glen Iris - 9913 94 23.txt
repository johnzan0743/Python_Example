Person's Name : Yuri

Establishment :  1414 Malvern Rd, Glen Iris.

Date of Visit : 21/06/2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_1...-JAPANESE.html

Hours of Business : 9.30a - 10.30pm weekdays

Rates : $60 / 45 minutes

Age : around twenties

Size/shape : Possible medium size asian girl, about 160ish tall

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : Will not be back with her

I felt aching in my back that day so I thought I'll find some formal massage establishment.  Browsing locanto and found the above link.  Called up, she said I don't need to make an appointment only to be disappointed that walk-in can only have 45 minutes.  Since the common rule is the girl who take your booking will be the one that massage you, I was happy I got this japanese girl doing me.  It turned out to be a DUD!  I wasn't expecting HJ/BJ?extra etc but wasn't expecting to be massage so soft like that.  What she did throughout the time was putting possibly one finger down or maybe a knucle, press down and run it around the whole time.  I can only feel one touch at the back!  No straighten up movement throughout your back which is typical asian massage whether using your arms or just both palms running from shoulder down, no using elbow and/or possible using multiple finger press.  English is limited but I can vouch from her accent that she IS a japanese.  The aftermath of this:  leaving the premise feeling disappointed, not to mention my aching or sore back is not certainly reduce or relaxed or better.

So, A V O I D this girl!  I consider another girl who is a filipino =, who appears to have curvy, larger body with a nice pair.  Didn't ask her name but worries me to come back and is served by this jap girl again.  Better call and make appointment with who is available that day, folks!

NOTE: this establishment is on 1414 Malvern Rd, there is another one in 1418 Malvern road, just about 2-3 doors from there.  By the way this 1414 one looks very legit as no-fool-around massage place from the outside, saw a few asian and a few older aussie blokes dressing well/professional (or probably because it just happen to be winter).  I know a lot of tradies visit massage place for various aching/injury reason apart from RnT.  This is certainly not what I saw that day.  On the other hand, the other one (1418) looks shady from the outside, possibly chinese-owned type, with big pictures etc at the front, and light sign board.  ooh boy, I don't go to that type of premise by the way.

Additional NOTE:  NO extra is offered after the flip, she still continue with that point pressing that goes round and round.  Good on me! This was probably the least money spent on my journey to massage parlour.

Saw new massage place put up add. Thought I would try it after long day. walked in. Waited 10 min. Cici came out. guided me to small room. She was brunette, cute , petite. Did the usual massage . started on back. Was actually pretty good. Not much teasing so thought oh dear is this legit massage.
On the flip she got a little closer to ole fella. Then after 5 min asked if i wanted any extra. Went for a nude slide option which was awesome. Very nice little body. finished off with nice long unrushed hand job. That extra cost abut $80 from memory.

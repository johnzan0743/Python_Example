No wonder they fail to make a profit, your massage time includes getting undressed and dressed prior and after the massage. This could take 10-15 minutes off your 1 hour booking. Not good enough.

Well, I can only assume that you are very, very slow in dressing and undressing or you like to perform a sensual striptease for your massage lady !!

True, but lets not forget the hot towels for the removal of most of the used oil and the introductions at the start of the booking. So if you want a real hour of massage, book for 90 minutes HA HA!

Agree !! 

Especially here, at least 5 RnTs in this little patch of shops. 

All competing on service & price.

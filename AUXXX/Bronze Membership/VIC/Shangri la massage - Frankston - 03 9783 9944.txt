My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all  of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a  picture of time spent and experience had.)
walk in to the usual friendly smiles "how long you want"  45 will do to  relax a bit first.   strip of into the basket, jump on the table.
starts of with firm pressure through a towel, im thinking waste of time  here. then came out the oils, lots of back rubbing, neck, more back..  come on..
down to the legs, then the bum.. woo here we go, nope not yet. more legs  brushing the sack a little. on the turn she rubbed the legs a little  then wispered to me if i wanted the other bits massages, yes please for a  $30 bonus, could have paid another $20 for her to take her top of. kept  that on in the pocket.
the usual went on as per normal,  the only warning ill give is when the  "pressures of life are released" she tried to move onto a head massage, i  didnt want that something about marry look, so i kindly declined and we  parted ways.

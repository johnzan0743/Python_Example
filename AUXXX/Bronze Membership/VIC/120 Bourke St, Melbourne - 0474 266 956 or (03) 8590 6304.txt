My experience/comments : 

Well, after a shit of a day at work, I felt like a massage with a bit more - so did the search on Locanto (it has been a while) and found a few. The 2 ads which I wanted to try were unavailable. So I unfortunately found this place. 
I called - no answer. As it was close by to where i was i just did a walk by. It is on Bourke St, so lots of foot traffic going past, but it was late, dark and raining. And I was horny - so in I walked. (it probably wouldn't be the best place to visit at lunchtime).
Met by a reasonably attractive lady, who then shouted at me 'Massage?!'. Er, yes please. 'fifty dollar first!' Okay.... handed it over.
I was led to a room, well more a box really. Walls that didn't go to the ceiling and no space to move. Struggled to undress and hung up all my items on the wall hooks and lay down. The towels were clean.
Shouty walks back in and proceeds to do a massage. I felt like i was being tenderized. Not very relaxing. Surprisingly, it was helpful for my stiff neck / shoulders. But that could have just been luck. She also had some serious callouses on her hands, so it felt like i was being scratched every time she moved her hands over me. She also darted out of the room a couple of times to deal with walk ins. On the second time, i decided i would pass on the Rub if she offered.
Anyway.....
She finishes the massage and does the fingernail thing all over the back of me -  it get a small rise out of me. She tells me to turn over. Does the usual 'ohh...you big boy..' etc. And proceeds to grab my dick saying 'You want me to do this'. As i said, i was at half mast so thought 'why not?'. I asked how much......150 she whispered in my ear. I actually burst out laughing. 'No'. This did not make her happy. She asked how much I would pay for her amazing body while grabbing my hand and rubbing them over her tits - 20 I said. She tried 100 - 20 said. She tried 50 - i said No. 
She realised i was serious in my No, and began back peddling. 'ok,ok,ok - 20 is ok' she said. Now this is the best part of the whole experience, while beginning to pull me off, she starts rummaging in my trouser pockets for my wallet - until i tell her stop. She wont go on untill i hand over the cash - FFS! 
At this point i should have walked... but i stood up starkers with a hard-on, found my wallet and gave her 20. I lay back down and she proceeded to pull me off at such a great speed i thought she was going to rip my dick off. Anyway - i dont know why - but I came pretty quickly. But she stopped before I had fully finished...grrrr.
She walks out of the room (box) to get me a wipe and leaves the door wide open while I'm uncovered and messy. I actually shout for her to come and close the door. She hands me the towel and I clean up myself. 
After I am dressed and am leaving the room, she tries to give me a kiss and asks me to come back again. I say not likely, and I must have been a bit upset by the whole experience because as I'm leaving, there is another chap about to go into one of the other room and i turn to him and say, quite loudly, 'I wouldn't bother mate, this was the worst rub and tug I've ever had'. He just looked as me like a rabbit in head lights. Then Shouty McShoutFace stats yelling at me to leave. Which i do.

Would I return? Erm..No.

Another 150$ and it seems it wasnt even a nude hj she was offering. You did well to stay firm, in the wallet area that is.  Well done. ae1 it used to be about service many years ago in these massage shops. Now its how much can we fleece this guy.  A tragedy, and this behaviour is ruining the rnt industry

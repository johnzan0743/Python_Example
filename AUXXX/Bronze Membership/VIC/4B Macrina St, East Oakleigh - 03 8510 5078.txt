I offered $30 here and my chick cracked it! Guys in next cubicle were overheard to pay $40 and $50 for HJ's.

Hey Guys, I believe this place has been closed down by the local LE. Read it on another forum by chance and thought would let you guys know down in Melbourne.

Apparently the punter reporting was actually there at the time the LE were in the shop and started asking him questions. He was smart to get out.

Another one bites the dust.

Great to see the tax payers of Victoria getting value from their hard earned cash. You guys must feel so much safer when walking the streets, now that one less evil R & T exists. Three cheers for those brave officers who put their bodies on the line; hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray

So, they have relocated. I won't publish the new location, that would be like shooting ourselves in the foot, but I'm sure some of you have found them already.  Check the normal sites boys, they are advertising, you'll find them. Same staff, and pretty much same daily roster as before.

Apparently the neighbours were complaining about the foot and car traffic, lack of parking for fish and chip shop customers and so on. Cops and council showed up, and got quite aggressive with staff and management. Getting right up in the faces of the girls and screaming at them about the alleged 'obscenities' they were up to with customers. Of course, they all just said no, they not doing that, nobody admitted to anything, and rightly so.   Cops performed a bit of a search of the premises, nothing found. No further legal action as far as I know, they were just told to close down immediately, and probably a fine to pay. 

New place is better anyway, nicer premises, proper ceilings, and doors!!!

Just as a follow up to the above post I made, and the general state of things regarding RnT at the moment. To the MODS, what is the accepted M.O when it comes to doing reviews of RnT joints and private ladies who are making some cash on the side(unregistered). We all know that publishing their details contributes quite heavily to the inevitable, and we killing our own market here. I have seen some reviews without names and addresses that are accepted, and I've seen other that are pushed back, and I have personally been on the receiving end of private messages and forum replies from unhappy forum members when I have opted to not supply contact details.

I now only review legal established venues, and registered privates, but I would like to review the RnT's and "other" privates as well, there are some hotties that I know of that I do want other punters to know about, and of course, I'd like to keep my review count moving along, but at the same time, I don't want to contribute to their downfall. Don't get me wrong, I'm not naive, I know eventually it will happen, they will get found out and closed down, but if I can help prolong their active status for a bit, hell, I'd rather help with that.

So can we set an accepted and forum wide rule or standard for RnT and private lady reviews, or if there is one that doesn't put them in danger of being busted too quickly, what is it? Or, do we either choose to do full reviews, disclose all details, and just hope for the best. I'm in no way saying I want us to go the way of the other forum where they have ridiculous clues like 'nik nak', or 'down by the sea', 'under the moon' and phrases like that, we here to read and share, not play word games.

Thank you for your post adventurous.

Will try and get a useful reply to you a bit later although the matter has been canvassed here, http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f286/b...12/index6.html posts 78 onward, especially AB's reply.

Cheers for the quick response FC, I just had a read of AB's post, and that does clarify things somewhat. I just wasn't sure if it would count towards my review count if I leave out the contact details. So if it does count, i'll start to do RnT reviews again, but in an effort to help safe guard the establishments\ladies, I won't supply contact details. I don't mind if well established and contributing forum members contact me for details. And if anyone complains, I'll direct them to this thread. :-)

Personally, I think the Melbourne guys should start being a bit more vigilant with their posts now, especially RnT reviews, the less forced closures that occur, the more choice we will have, and that surely will do something when it comes to pricing, on the flipside, I guess it makes it hard for us to be sure if a review is genuine or not,  Joe bloggs could just write any crap, use the proper acronyms, and voila, his got his silver membership after a few goes at that, so it is a bit of a rock and a hard place I guess.

Just to be clear, I'm not criticizing the forum, the review rules, or the mods, just bringing my thoughts across, hoping to encourage others to give us their feelings on it.

Adventurous..

As you have read and said.. There is no way around it.. 

The use of "code", "landmarks", mobile phone number and general location details is the only way possible.. of course this would only be known to those who are common around the area or local.. obviously Sydney reviewers have no idea of those of Melbourne location or vice versa.. so a "general" review is all that can be placed in bronze.. we have no solution for it at this point in time.. it has been used with quite good success on another forum.. so i don't see why it cannot be replicated here..

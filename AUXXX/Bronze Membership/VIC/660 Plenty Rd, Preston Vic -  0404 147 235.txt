Person's Name : Candy

Establishment : 660 Plenty Rd, Preston

Date of Visit : 15 November 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :  0404147235

Hours of Business : 10am to 8pm

Rates : $70 for what was billed as 30 minutes but shorter period and some extra $  for extra's

Age : 30-35

Size/shape : Size 6/thin

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian, looked Korean but not confirmed

Services Provided : Most if not all

Value for money/recommend? : Not value for money for an AMP however lots more available than at most AMP's.

My experience/comments : I called this relatively new place before coming in and was advised don't bother booking as girls available etc.  5 minutes later I buzzed the front door and was let in after about 10 seconds by a 50ish European guy.  

He advised that one girl had just gone to lunch and the remaining was about to start with a client who had come in just before me, therefore there would be a 30 min plus wait, needless to say, my annoyance was evident in my voice and demeanour.

All of a sudden, an outgoing Asian girl popped out from further in the building to ask if I was after a massage "or the extras," when I advised the extras, she said she hadn't started with her current client and he was happy to wait 5-10 minutes for his massage so she would take care of me.

After leading me to a private room, she said her name was Candy she left me to get set up and disappeared to let the other client know he should wait.  On her return she took off her clothes and I discussed options and negotiated $40 for a CBJ (+$70 for the non existent massage). She tried to interest me in FS (protected) for another $20 and I am confident if I wasn't such a disease phobic she would have allowed BBBJ for the same price as CBJ.  

Once the magic started, she jumped up on the table on her knees with me underneath and went the gobble,  I had free access with my hands to all her areas.  I managed to insert fingers in her pussy and rear passage which she did not object to and after about five minutes she stripped off my protection and used her hand to take me to completion.  Candy was a great talker and gave me the full praise up on my movie star looks which is always fun (if not always believable).

After getting dressed and leaving, I realised I was $120 for about 10-15 minutes which seems harsh but she certainly worked for the money.  All up a good experience and one worth repeating, oh and thanks to the anonymous client in another room who delayed his own satisfaction to fit me in.

Cheers, 

Hommo

HH don't you think that you were taken to the cleaners, $120 or was it $110 ($40 + $70 unless you gave a tip) for 15mins "massage, touching and HJ?

No glasses and yes was pricey ($110 is right,  excuse my math). I knew it was $70 for the half hour from ad in Locanto so had gone expecting to pay. It was my first visit and truth be known wasn't to upset at missing the massages as was in the mood for extras.  When I go again will attempt to negotiate it down if possible.

The first was deleted as requested. To use the draft mode, created the Review using "Go Advanced" in the "Quick Reply" section and it allows previewing of the proposed post before uploading.

The Edit function is available in both modes for about 15-20 mins after you upload so can always use that. After that it is not available so will need to contact a moderator as you did.

Last week i went to 674 after finding it in Locanto. The picture was of a sensual naked lady so clear indication that they are up to something. Upon arriving, ring the bell, tall asian guy did not even ask and walked me to a room. The lady was already inside the room. Place looks dirty and WL was well in her 30's not attractive. I just wanted to run out the place, but she try to persuade me to stay, 70 for 30mins nude massage. I kept saying that it was too much for me, and saying thanks. I walked out the place. I would not recommend it if you like clean places, but if you dont mind that, in this place they can give you what you looking for.

been there 5 times.  1st time was the full 30 minutes(posted review for it but cant find it since the cull) and each time as got gradually worse.  Seen 3 different women and they were all on the wrong side of 40 .The last time was lucky to be 5 minutes of light brushing on my arse before she asked if i wanted fs.  When i declined she just grabbed the member and lifted a leg and jerked as quick and hard as she could then out the door.  never again.

Person's Name : Marisa

Establishment : 660 Plenty Rd, Preston

Date of Visit : November 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :  0404147235

Hours of Business : 10am to 8pm

Rates : $100/30 mins

Age : 40+

Size/shape : Size 12-14

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided: Massage, BBBJ+CIM. FS and ANAL also offered.

Value for money/recommend: On looks, no. On service, excellent.

My experience/comments : Buzzed the door, was let in by papasan and was then greeted by ML.

She says "100 dollar" then points to her mouth, her crotch then hops side on and points to her arse too.

"What?"

She repeats: "100 dollar" then points to her mouth, her crotch then hops side on and points to her arse too.

"$100 up the arse?"

She grins happily and nods her head. I'm in shock, what is this place? But with my jaw to the floor my hands found two pineapples and handed them over asap.

Follow her into the room, we undress and unfortunately it was at this point that I realised there was no way I was gonna fuck this woman. Without her flattering clothes it was all saggy. She was so bubbly, energetic and motivated though, bless her.

Making the best of the situation I asked her to massage me for a bit, but she clearly wasn't trained in that. Then I rolled over and she started the bbbj and boy she was good. So enthusastic and took it extremely deep.  This went on for quite a while, then when she withdrew to go to the next act i said "No No keep going, don't stop" 

"Ok" she replied "You cum here" she says pointing to her open mouth. Bless this woman, seriously. And so i did. She enthusiastically drank it all up although she didn't swallow.

For enthusiasm and effort, 10/10, I wish more WLs were like Marisa. Wonderful. Her best years are well behind her, pleasant enough face but no, not that body no.  But if your one who doesn't care about that then she will take you anywhere you want it. Or just do what I did.

I probably overpaid for that part of town, especially given i didn't take up what I actually paid for, although we did go over time somehow. But it was a strange, fun experience anyway so I was very happy. To be clear, I paid $100 in total.

Person's Name : Melissa

Establishment : 660 Plenty Rd, Preston

Date of Visit : February 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0404 147235

Hours of Business : 10am to 8pm

Rates : $100 for 30mins all included

Age : At least in her 40s

Size/shape : Cuddly about a 14 

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided: Massage, DATY, RIMMING, FS, BBBJ and CIM. 

Value for money/recommend: Definitely not everyone's cup of tea but value for money.

My experience/comments : I had seen Melissa once before a while ago, just happened to be in the area so decided to see if she was available. As I said above, not everyone's cup of tea but very friendly, very enthusiastic and will do just about anything. We go to the room and I hand her $100 and she leaves for a few minutes, I nude up and when she returns, she does the same. Not the most attractive body but Im ok with that. She immediately drops to her knees and engulfs my cock, giving me a very good wet sloppy BBBJ, I save the massage for later. Lots of good suction then I turn around, bend over and she starts with a damn good rimming while pulling my cock. Time for a break and I get her on the table, she spreads wide and bury my face in her rather wet pussy. This continues for a little while until it's time for "fuckie" as she calls it. On with the condom and away we go. By this time I'm close so didn't last too long. She did offer her arse but I politely said no. After a quick clean up for both of us, she returned and gave me an average massage, not overly concerned, not really why I was there, but was relaxing enough. Time was up, she gave me a big hug and a smile and said goodbye. 

Would I return: Yes.

Yes I am pretty sure it is the same one. I reviewed her in another section a fair while ago now and after reading the reviews above, I have no doubt it is the same person, Melissa/Marissa, just the way the name is pronounced given how some Asians mix up the r and the l occasionally, as you have highlighted with your joke about the erections above, very clever.

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

This place is a regular of mine as i see Melissa here abit but saw a new girl so gave her a try.
I walked in and was greeted by Cherry, she took me to the first room. I gave her $100, she asked had I been before to which I replied yes.
Cherry returned to the room I was already on my back on the table with half a Stiff....lol. Cherry removed all of her clothing, she revealed a reasonable body, nice tits and bum.
She commenced with a BBBJ which got me instantly hard, she had great technique, nice head and ball licking. Where she was standing gave me easy access to her pussy and bum. She allowed FIP and FIA, which she seemed to enjoy. After about 5 mins she asked would I like full service to which I replied could I fuck her in the bum, to which she replied yes. She applied the dom and lubed me up and applied some lube to herself. She hopped up on the table in doggy position, I got behind her and slowly inserted my rock hard cock into her bum. She was very tight, but I managed to get at least half my cock into her bum. As she was so tight I knew I would not last long, so I came after 2-3 minutes, managed a fairly big load. I took my cock out and Cherry removed the dom and asked would l like to be sucked , I said yes and she proceeded to suck me off for another couple of mins but was obvious i wasn't going to cum again. I then dressed and was on my way.

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)
After reading some funky reviews on this place, I decided to give it a try. After negotiating gaps in traffic and looking to see whether the restaurant up the road could see me, I pressed the buzzer and waited the few seconds till the door opened (it felt like hours though  into the foyer and whisked out the back - met with a tubby lady in her 40's who spoke Little English and handed over my $100. Onto the creaky table and waited. in she comes, nudes up and starts a massage that was actually OK. Usual tickles towards the end then the flip. Bit of HJ and BBBJ then I got up and bent her over the table and engaged in some FS. 
It was rather mechanical and not much interest showed by her and I was done in a few minutes. Quick clean and then out..again negotiating traffic and peds.
If you are after a quick empty and don;t care too much about whats at the other end of your knob, then this place is a grantee. If you are fussy, their locanto ad is misleading (duh!!). I'm yet to experience what others have in their reviews above, but maybe another visit will address this. Overall, somewhat disapointed as there are others in the area that provide better.

Yeah.

Have seen ruby before in a 3sum with Melissa and at the time both girls did everything all natural.

This time Ruby didnt want to do nat sex which is fine as its something i didnt want so settled for a bbbj cum twice.

Her suction is good and first load didnt take long down her throat. 

Laid down for a quick 5 min massage then round 2 started. This time she had to work for it and eventually blew my load all over her titts. 

Place is a dump and girls arnt the prettiest but they are always keen to make sure you leave happy so cant fault them for that.

I am on fairly good terms with the Papasan here, and have his missus who runs other shops as a contact. I will send her a message and see if she can shed any light in whats going on after the lockdown finishes. Same might apply for 621 across the road.

OK, who did you speak to Johnny, any idea? Was it Mandy? I have tried a few times to contact her to see what will happen after lock down ends but she is not answering. That was a couple of weeks ago now so maybe I will try again.
I can confirm after talking to the wife of Papasan at 660, that they intend re opening after lock down ends at this stage and she will update me if that changes.
Apple manager from 541 assures me they will reopen after lock down, but not sure how much clout she has there apart from running it day to day.
So I should be ok if those 2 at least reopen and I will continue to chase up Mandy about 621.

Yes, they knew alright Brauny. His missus sent me the wechat msg on Monday to advise they were open for business.
Spoke to Mandy across the road, booked Angela for saturday.
Apple messaged me this morning to advise 541 reopened.

So thats my little cluster of 3 that I frequent most regularly, all up and running again.

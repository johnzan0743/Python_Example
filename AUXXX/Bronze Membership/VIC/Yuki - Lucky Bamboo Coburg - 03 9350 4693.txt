My experience/comments :

Paid lucky bamboo a visit today (Monday) on my day off. Booked one hour with Yuki for $70. Had seen a review of Yuki on another forum and thought to give her a go. Mid 20's, shy malaysian girl. Good english, able to converse comfortably. Not bad looks as well and decent body. 
Massage was actually pretty good if you have soreness in the back or legs. Otherwise, she doesn't tease the sack like other ML's i've had in the past. Spent most of the hour face down. With about 10 minutes to go she asks me to flip over to which she proceed to massage my head for about 5. Then comes over as if to finish up, but I ask for extras to which she responds 'oh i'm sorry i didn't think you wanted extras' since i'm not a typical anglo-aussie. What? 
Offers $30 HJ or $50 Nude HJ with touching (was explicit about no touching 'inside'). Went for the $50 Nude HJ. 
Pretty good technique on her part. It was a super cold day but she got me hard in no time. Allowed kissing during, and I used my hands to explore most of her body with her shying away every time i got near her privates. Got a little bit frustrating but she was good enough to finish me before it made it a poor experience nonetheless. Would I come back? If I was desperate and in the area, maybe. But I would probably try another girl. 
Massage: 8/10; Looks: 6/10

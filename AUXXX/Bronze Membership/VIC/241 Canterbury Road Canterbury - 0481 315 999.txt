My experience/comments : 
Started the New Year with a more local massage place. No booking, just walked in around 3pm and was greeted by a relatively bored looking receptionist, paid for the hour and was asked if I had a masseuse I was looking for; being my first time here I said no preference and was led to a room. Amy came into the room pretty much immeditaely and introduced herself, her English was ok and was able to have a brief conversation with her. She asked me to undress and get on the massage table and asked if I wanted a soft or firm massage - the massage itself was definitely firm and I would give her massage skills a 8/10. 

Before turning over, she whispered in my ear if I wanted anything else today and said that it was $60 for HE or $80 for BJ. I offered $70 for BJ which was accepted and as an added bonus she took her top off, but let her bra on (although this was probably because she didn't want to get it dirty). Technique was ok - a bit of teeth, but that helped me not to blow too quick. When I was about to pop, I warned her and she finished me off with her hand directing the stream of cum onto my chest. 

Would I return? Yes , service was overall quite good and I have no complaints.

Plenty of places in melbourne where you can get much better prices than this person paid, read the reviews.
I had a nude massage & BBBJ in Plenty Road Preston yesterday by an attractive 40 year old Asian for $70, review to follow.

It sure does Anderloo. Preston/Reservoir and surrounding area is a great place to punt.
Having said that if you spend some time shopping around, contacting girls in the CBD there is good value to be had.
I fucked a beautiful girl, Pandora in the CBD just before xmas. Her asking price is $150 for 30 minutes, she allowed me $100 for 20 minutes, and she was well worth it.

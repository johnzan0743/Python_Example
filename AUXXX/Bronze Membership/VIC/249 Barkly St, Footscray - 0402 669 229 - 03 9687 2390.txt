My experience/comments : 

I was up in Footscray and wandered past this place. On the spur of the moment I decided it was time to have a punt and went in to see what was on offer. I was met in the reception area by Leeling, a fairly attractive Asian woman wearing a long dress, who was available straight away so I said yes to a 1/2 session with her. She lead me upstairs and into a good sized room and immediately put a clean towel on the massage table as we entered. Impressed by the hygiene right from the off. There was no mucking around with this girl, she offered a $70 massage with CBJ right from the off so there was no doubt as to what was in store for me. So I paid the money over, and unusually she stayed in the room and we both stripped off. I was impressed by her perky B cups with good sized nipples and neatly trimmed bush. I prefer a bush to bald, just a personal thing. Anyway we had a hug and a fondle before I hopped up on the table. Her massage technique was ok, I've had better, with a fair amount of attention paid the nether regions which felt really good. 

On the flip she concentrated on the old fella and gave me plenty of access to her nice tits and nipples. After a few more minutes on went the cover and she gave a very good, unrushed bj allowing me full access to have a play with her pussy which she seemed to enjoy, judging by the increasing wetness between her legs. Needless to say I got over line and she cleaned me up with wet wipes. There was still a few minutes of the booking left and she filled it in with an enjoyable and relaxing head massage. 

After finishing she refused a tip, saw me out and I went on my way.

Leeling is pleasant woman with quite reasonable English language skills, so it is possible to have a conversation with her which I always reckon is a bonus. However she is not one of those ML who constantly prattles on with a load of crap which is even better. I got the feeling from her that FS might be on offer after a couple of visits. when I have time I'll go back to test this theory.

My experience/comments :

As promised gave this place a go today!


finally got the chance to sample this place today as i had plans to visit in the near future!

 getting there was a real bitch as i encountered peak traffic in the early arvo, must be everyone knocking off early for a friday. parked near barkly on one of the side streets with small parking lots, fortunately a few spaces so didnt have to fight for a space. 

after waiting in traffic for so long, i was glad to have finally arrived and was looking forward to what is expected according to the other fellas here. walked in and was greeted by an older vietnamese lady, around 45+, seems like she owns the place as she just handles the traffic of people.

i waited in the front area and she called down another lady around 35, not bad looking but not a stunner, certainly your average ML asian that youd expect at these places. in i went as she directed me upstairs into a spacious room, with the amenities on the side in a small shelf. before stripping she prodded me and straight up asked what i want, do i want 30mins/1hour, do i want happy ending or do i want blowjob?

 taken a back by how direct she was i had a quick think and went with the bj option as i sure needed the extra relief! she said $70 all up and said i can pay her after. i stripped off while she took off her blouse and began oiling me up after i went face down on the table.

 started with oil in the middle of the back and then spreading around the body, legs, arms, then upper back. the massage was extremely poor and it'd be a felony to call what she provides a massage. but i wasnt upset as i didnt go for the massage this time! her technique seemed like it was made for time killing, just rubbing on the skin with fingers and then every now and then she'd do the chop-chop on my back. absolutely no teasing which was a bit of a downer but since we already agreeed upon a bj at the end i didnt have to worry.

after enduring her horrible 'massage', i.e. finger poking and stroking on my body, for about 20 minutes, she stopped and asked me to flip. she took off her bra and her undies and revealed a set of medium b cups, not bad but you can tell her age has had an impact on them, with a bit of a stomach. as i started to have a cup, i began to become hard and she got a condom to go on junior and began sucking away.

her technique wasn't bad but she did have to keep stopping to gasp for air (not sure why as im sure shes done this a lot LOL). after a bit i finally came and she made sure to milk me out in the condom. after cleaning up, she said thanks and i reciprocated and settled the bill.

 certainly not a bad place if youre looking for relief, but i advise like most asian massage shops, if you're after a legit massage AND relief then avoid!

My experience/comments :
Had a half he to kill whilst in the area. Place was recommended by a friend a while ago n have been meaning to go. 

Anyway walk in. Joint was a bit quite. Older lady boss welcomes me sends me upstairs. Am greeted by A larger chunkier Viet woman. I was hoping it wasn't going to b her. Murphy's law .. It was. Her name was Kim. Asked what I needed I said massage with normal service. n handed her a pineapple n a lobster. She tried to convince me for others. I joked with her n told her she'd have to pay me instead! Anyhooo on to the table with birthday suit on. Decent massage. Nothing great. 

No tease no nothing. So wasn't really in the mood by time flip. Into the flip and I realise this woman is not interested. Does not allow much.. Only squeezes of ass cheek. I got big hands but could not even grab one cheek! Anyway. Job was mechanical n I had to close my eyes n remind myself of the best rubs I've had to get me over the line. All in all... not great. One to place in the vault to nvr repeat again... Happy punting

Is it a huge space upstairs with 3 rooms? One shower in the corner and the toilet up the other end? I'm trying to remember if I have been there.

you can come across a lot of viet students working here. But the service is mediocre. Some young girls don't even provide FS, only half naked HJ massage

I walked past this shop couple days ago, doing the rounds, and when I came home, I noticed it had no advertising.  Today I walked towards it and a 5$ note rushed towards me by the wind.  I picked it up and thanked the gods.   The shop advertising above on the brick wall, showed the Korean Hollywood massage, and the metal gate was pulled up, so I rang the bell, no answer, but I did notice lights on inside.  I walked around the back to see if entry was available, but couldn't work out which shop it was.   came back around and found the metal door was now pulled down.  Is this shop still operating?

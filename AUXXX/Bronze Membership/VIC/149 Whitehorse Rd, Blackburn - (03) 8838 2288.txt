Finished my lunch on Sunday afternoon and I was thinking to have a  legitimate massage. I drove my car to a nearby massage parlour in my  suburb, I parked my car at rear car park as it was easy access to the  back of the massage parlour. 
   I was greeted by the owner, and I ask if she would be available to  massage me, unfortunately, she was supposed to have a client in another  15 minutes, and she introduced another young lady who she said was  really good.
   I paid $60.00 for 45 minutes and was asked to go to the first room. 5  minutes later, a young lady came in and she never introduced herself and  I couldn't bother. 
   The massage was really average, no accidental touch, not sensual, just plain and hard.
   After 45 minutes, she wiped me down with a hot tower and the session ended.
   Overall, an average massage by an average lady with an average price. No complaint.

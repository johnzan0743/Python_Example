My experience/comments : Walked into to this place and a not great but not bad looking woman came out of a massage room and told me she was busy and I would have to wait 10min so i said I'll be back in 10. Returned after a 10min walk and she led me in to a room and put a fresh clean sheet on the table which made me happy. I requested a 30min massage with no oil because I was meeting some friends later she said okay and started gently rubbing my back and eventually worked her way down to the legs and but area, when she gently brushed the crack area I said "that's nice" so she did a few more times until the flip. She asked the question and when agreed she asked if I wanted her to use oil which I said yes. Her technique was great, slow and double handed and when she noticed the end was near she increased the pace and pressure until I was done, she then went to get a warm towel to clean me up. While I was getting dressed I asked her what her name was and she replied "Selena" while she changed the sheet(Which made me happy) I gave her a $40 tip because she did a good job and the place is clean.Person's Name :

Haha. To be honest many early 20s reviewed here are in fact late 20s to early 30s.  I guess once you are over 45 all of them looked young.

No offense to Elfang but if he thinks Selena is in her early 20's it's time for the optometrist.

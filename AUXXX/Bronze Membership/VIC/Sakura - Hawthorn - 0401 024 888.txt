Thought I'd try this place. It was a very nice shop and clean.

Had a massage from a cute girl, great conversation, great massage.

She didn't suggest anything on the flip and I didn't want to push it.

Will go back as massage was one of the best.

Person's Name : Trish

Establishment : Sakura massage Hawthorn

Date of Visit : January 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Burwood rd Hawthorn

Phone :0401024888

Hours of Business : 10-8

Rates : 80 per hour massage + extras

Age : 24

Size/shape : 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Vietnamese Australian

Services Provided : massage, HJ, nude, oral

Value for money/recommend? : hmmm, maybe- expensive but she's gorgeous

My experience/comments: Trish is a gorgeous young girl with hot body, DD bolt enhanced breasts. Massage is just average, more an oil rub. She's quite happy to gloss over the massage to get you flipped so she can get to work making money with extras. nude, HJ, oral and fingering for $150 was expensive but she could earn 3 times that as an escort or parlour worker.
She is a bit of a clock watcher and keen to get you over the line and out the door which is a little off putting . With that said it doesn't take that long when she's doing her thing. Overall a better than average punt mainly because she is a stunner with an amazing fit sexy body and the extras she provides.

This above review is pointless considering the shop and  there other 2 establishments were given the death notice on the front door a month ago.

You will find Trish here along with other favs like Olivia and Annie- å°ç½å"ç§äººå®å¶ | å¢¨å°"æ¬åäººææ'© For those who don't know, when there 3 massage shops had proscribed brothel notices applied, they went underground, or overground into 2 apartments as per the website. For some reason there Hawthorn shop continues to operate, i believe as the pivotal point for all the bookings on there website.  They want mandarin speaking customers, and have blocked most existing customers, although a couple of old customers have been lucky to have been kept on as customers.  

For somebody like me who used to see Annie at the Hawthorn shop, i really need to go down there and have a quick chat with them, requesting they unblock my number and let me see Annie again, assuming the receptionists remember me.  I know of one bloke who used google translate to make a booking, they worked out he was not Chinese, but they respected his efforts, and now make booking on there website though English with him.  The only real tricky way for a westerner to get a booking in these apartments if u do not have mandarin speaking friends, is too go to the suburb of the girl u want to see, befriend a mandarin speaker, even offer to buy them lunch,maybe offer them a small cash incentive, or even go to a massage shop in the city, and ask the receptionist to help u get a booking, treat them as your agent as such.

Have that person do all the communication with this business, while giving u text updates about what time u need to be at an apartment block etc.  The agent is in constant contact with the business, while u wait for instructions.   The only tricky bit would be knocking on the door and whoever opens realizes u are not a mandarin speaker, but hey i reckon all the bookings are done at there Hawthorn shop, so if u can get into the apartment, you should be able to get away with it.

Thanks for the update Brauninc.
To be honest it sounds like way too much hard work . There are plenty of shops and girls around that you don't need to jump through hoops to make a booking. 
What you describe just tells me they don't want western clientele. I will give it a miss I think!

Drove past tonight in a pervert capacity, an Indian man took a look at the notice then walked in hehe.  So there still getting business.  There is a guy on another forum who told me he has seen Annie 3 times in the apartment setups, he said she offers the full service 250$ on top of 50$ massage fee, and he quoted her "as an average fuck, she is still learning but is tight". Considering her tight body that comes as no surprise.

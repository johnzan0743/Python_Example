My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)
Haven't been in the area in a while so thought to pop in - Jess was one of two there at the time. She was very chatty during my visit and gave a reasonable massage, fairly strong too. once flipped, her hands caressed close to the nether regions and she popped the question...50 for a topless hj...with touching allowed. As she did the deed she never lost eye contact - come to think of it, I don't think she blinked once whilst she was working on my wand...!
If I'm in the area I think I would try her again...!

Having had a reasonable experience with Jess I thought I'd see if she was in again. Unfortunately there was only one person working but I went with it. She was with another punter and asked me to wait for five, so I did.
Having asked for an hour, she talked me down to 45 mins saying she had another appointment. Eventually (after what seemed like a very long time waiting) the massage started. Another chatty one - even more so this time. She complained about how another girl was supposed to come but didn't turn up, so she was all alone. Then she went on about the boss and issues with the shop etc. I think the final straw was when she kept mentioning how good she is at massaging...I don't know whether she was convinced by that herself or whether it was to presuade me, but it didn't seem to work. 
Anyway, she was keen to do the extras - 50 for the topless hj - she was more than happy for me to do what I wanted with her breasts - with hands and mouth...
Her hands eventually got me over the line but I think the bravura talk was what put me off. I think if you want an 'auntie' type then she might be a good choice, but I'm not sure if I'll be in a hurry to see her again any time soon...!

Person's Name : Coco

Establishment : 4/150 Wattletree Rd Malvern

Date of Visit : 26/9/2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 03 9500 9870

Hours of Business : 10ish to 8ish

Rates : $50$ 30 plus 50$ extra

Age : quoted 30

Size/shape : Size 6 c-cups, 5 foot 5ish 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : mutual massage and DIY

Value for money/recommend? :Pretty kinky

This is the sister shop of 125 mckinnon.  Thought i would try it out.  Met Coco, who was wearing silver high heels, a silky yellow skirt, a tight blue blouse, which emphasized her tit region, a small tattoo on left shoulder, and just the sort of face i go for.The outfit think of a flight attendant like outfit.  This is a very small shop, probably stick with the Macca one.  The rooms are in a line, very small.  Coco has a stern look, and told me" 50 dollar".  Another man entered and she turned, i could see a g-string though her skirt.  She got into an argument with him, he wanted to know how he was going to pay for the parking outside the shop.

At this time i requested to meet the other girl, who was a younger girl wearing tight denim shorts, but Coco was the one i wanted, she came back in accepted the 50$ and proceeded with a requested soft massage.  She is 30 years old.  The massage consisted of light hands over the back, legs and ass cheeks, this did not change during the whole session, and no oil was used.  The bartering went on for 10 mins.  I asked to massage her, and she asked for 100$.  I had offered 20$ and she told me boss takes some of tips.  As time ticked down, the price came down to 80$.   30$ for a clothed hj, with no touching.  I kept saying no, i wanted to massage her hehe.

Coco told me time running out, so basically a 30 min session was turning into 20.  She seemed to be losing hope of getting anything, so offered 70, i countered with 50, and she finally agreed.  As with there other shop, they have those throw away sheets over the table.  Coco requested i use hand wipes before i massaged her legs.  She lean't back as i massaged her legs, it looked awkward, as i moved my hands closer to her privates.   I was a little nervous she would snap at me, and then asked her to lie on stomach.  This is where it got a bit kinky.  I took a risk and pulled her skirt up, revealing an aqua colored g-string. It had ridden up her ass perfectly, and i started massaging her legs with both hands.

I lean't over and kissed the back of her right leg.  She told me " no kiss", and giggled.  At this stage the sight of her ass cheeks was turning me on.  Her legs were a little spread, and she seemed to have no idea, i was massaging her with one hand, while the other was DIY.  She asked" are u ok".  I told her i was fine, and with light moaning, i knew i would climax with her not being able to stop me ,    She had no idea what i was up too, until she turned and seemed to smile with shock at the small mess i had left. She was concerned i had cum over her legs, and i assured her she was clean.  She folded the cloth up and that was that.

Coco told me if i come back again she will give me better price.  It was a bit kinky, she told me no body has done this before.  This is something i find incredibly sexy to do, and the earlier arguing just made it feel more intense, it's just a shame it had cost 50$. I might pop back and ask her if she works at another shop, where we could do a bit more, but not in this shop.  It's just too small.

Popped in here hoping this Stellar girl i met at 125 Mckinnon would be working here, and i could squeak past the cock blocker Lucy.  Was shocked to see Lucy here, in a work capacity, not a part time reception capacity.  She know's i have become obsessed with seeing Stellar, and will do everything she can to stop it happening.  The only way around it, is too invite her into a double massage with Stellar.  For some reason the mobile number for Mckinnon seems to be Lucy.  I should have stayed with Stellar when i met her on Saturday.  This 3 shop organization reminds me a little of Urban kneads and Tokyo milk, with these 2 having name changes.  Full of super bitches.

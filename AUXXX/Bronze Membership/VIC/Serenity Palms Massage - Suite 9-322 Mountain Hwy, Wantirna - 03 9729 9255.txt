It's called serenity palms massage. It used to be called something else but recently changed names and moved location. There is 1 review for the new shop in VIC massage section. http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f140/s...1-088-a-32156/
 The old shop had plenty of reviews.

I am hoping to get there and try it out, but for a nude massage with no extra's doesn't seem worth it really??

Called into their new shop in Nunawading today, fresh paint smell. 
Asked for a massage - "you want nude?" they ask - I ask who does nude - beautiful Aussie Girl they say, I ask to meet her first.
Girl was nice enough, just not what I would want to pay $90 for the hour for... And not what I would call "Beautiful"
Didn't stay, and I doubt this would be any good at all.

So does this mean that Julia is no longer working at this premises in Nunawading. Management\ownership sure has changed frequently at this place in Nunawading.

If the experience was in the last 3 months, members should post a review rather than a comment like this.

Members should remember that they must post post reviews to stay in (see  Reviews required to stay a member ) and for Bronze members to be promoted to Silver.

No Happy Endings at this place! DIY is an extra and the lady doesn't stay around.

Some of the girls charging extra $50 for touching!! WOWEE!!

not sure how they are still in business with other places around...

You have to pay extra to wank yourself!!!??? So who has to get paid when we do it at home?  What a fucking joke, they only charge  a premium because desperado's are so keen on getting Caucasian action, that all sense goes out the door when they walk in the establishment door. If someone says to me I can DIY, but I have to pay,  I'd probably laugh in her face face and tell her she's nuts.

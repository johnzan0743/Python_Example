My experience/comments :
It's my first visit and it was definitely not disappointing. This place is quite casual about how they roster the therapists, but probably because I called in the early morning on a Sunday and all 4 were available. I picked Amy purely because of her look and you will know what I mean when you see her. She has the sweetest smile and the nextdoorgirl look on her. 170cm tall and she has a great body.
The massage was quite average but her body responded strongly to my touching and I could hear her getting wet between the legs.
I sticked two fingers in there and she almost reached orgasm that way.

Finished with the best HJ admiring her body from the back.

Works Monday &amp; Saturday only

Nothing comes up for the number, or the address. Do you have a link for the Ad? Was she Aussie, or Scandinavian? The only one I can find is: 

National Health & Beauty
118 Foster St, Dandenong VIC 3175
(03) 9792 3393

No Foster Road in Dandenong. There is a Bible Education Centre listed at 118-120 also. Was it upstairs?

Checked it out today. Rubbish massage for $50, then she wanted another $50 for a HJ. Although the girl I saw was a very attractive I said no and went to Red Lantern to get off properly with a very pretty Thai girl. It's a big no from me. They all seem to be from South America.

I forgot to mention the place is very noisy. People talking outside the room and coming and going. The light in my room kept going dark and light which was very annoying till she got a candle. The girl I saw was from Chile.  Very chunky and heavily tattooed arms, but quite attractive face. The place is also on a very busy road and not discrete if you don't want to be seen walking in. Yes it's called Pamper Touch if you see the top of my picture and has big green massage graphics on the outside windows. There was no negotiation on price and time was cut short. I figured cut my loss and go somewhere else!

Yep there arrival has been sudden, and there moving outwards at a rapid pace.  Last year down st.kilda beach, i really started to notice the presence of South americans.  Worshiped Ayrton Senna as a youngster, never thought we would see a rapid South american influx.

The format of this text is exactly the same as McCauley place Bayswater send out. Are these shops related?

Yes, I recently found out they are both owner by the same person. Equally poor service.

And if things keep going the way they are in the USA with Trump we can expect more from the States and perhaps even Mexico.

I wonder if they get 457 Visa's also?

Curious about this place, advertising as recently opened and some quality pics for "all young Asian girls".

Anybody got any experience or advice regarding this one? Again, it looks promising but my punting hasn't been superb and would like to improve the quality of experience for next time.

i tried this place when it first opened over a year ago and it was legit. Sounds like it might have changed hands or at least become more adventurous re what's on offer.

It isn't the same operators. You'll find some familiar faces, and bodies here if you went to Urban, Little Bourke. It's not part of that chain though

Person's Name : Laura

Establishment : Jasmine Thai massage & beauty therapy, 54 Howard St, North Melbourne

Date of Visit : Sep 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_3...-Brunette.html

Hours of Business : 11-7

Rates : $60/45mins + $80 

Age : mid 20's

Size/shape : tall, skinny

Nationality or Ethnicity : English

Services Provided : nude hj

Value for money/recommend? : not bad

My experience/comments : Set up the appointment very easily over the phone. Place was well-kept and spacious with shower facilities. Got a decent lomi lomi massage; not the best I've had, but still pretty good. Wish she would have spent more time reaching around underneath. But at least it was a real lomi lomi, unlike some other places that advertise it but don't deliver at all. She's nice to talk to, and we got a good conversation going.

Asked about extras, she said 40 for hj or 80 for nude, she's fine with touching except between the legs. Paid 80 for the nude hj. I'm into skinny girls with smaller breasts, so I thought she had a pretty hot body. You might or might not agree. HJ wasn't anything special, but it was good enough and at least it wasn't just a quick rush to completion.

All in all, I think the massage itself was pretty good value, but not so much for the extras. But it seems you have to pay a premium for extras with white chicks.

Thanks for the review mate.  Are her pictures real on the ad?

I've seen Taylor and Jess at this same place and would recommend Jess.

No it is outside the relevant time limit as things may have changed. Maybe it is time for a different experience and Review.

Faddy I did see a Locanto a few months ago for Jess and the pic looked awesome but 
fake. It showed a very toned curvy tanned body - no face. Does she look like that at all?

Not too surpised at that, there are very few photos of girls that are of the supplier. It is all designed to bring in trade.

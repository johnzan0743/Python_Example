My experience/comments : after a busy day I stopped on here on the way home to have a look and see if it was worth a shot. No one in the waiting area and was short on time so went for 45mins for 60 (hour is 70). Place is clean and very inviting, went into room and was told to wait, no usual sighs of tissues in room so decided boxers on at the start.... girl comes in Thai average looking but nice bod under her clothes. Takes my watch off and gets into it. Massage was nice and good sign when she pulled off my boxers and massage my ass and back. She climbed all over me like a ninja and I was very relaxed got the occasional brush of her box on my ass or back but no sign of anything else. . 30 mins in she works on my legs and bang 5-6 times she runs her finger down my crack and tickles my date. Things were looking up. Then she tells me to sit up, and she started to twist and turn me like a human pretzel. Before saying thanks and come again. I ask for extra and she smiles and says next time full body? Not sure what that means but the Hot oil Thai Massage was mind blowing and made up for the fact that there was no HJ on offer. I'm going back for another shot just for the massage alone and I think there might be more to on offer  if I become a regular.

Value for money/recommend? : Cheapish Massage, overall yes but I will make it clearer what I am after before starting next time

My experience/comments :

I popped into 248 Russell based entirely on their ad on Locanto and having an hour to spare in the CBD around 15:30 hours.  My first visit and I came in through the street door which lead to a set of stairs, about half way up a mid 30's Asian lady popped her head out and looked at me quizzically.  I asked for a 60 minute massage and she said no problems for $60.

After exchange of money she lead me to a room with a massage table and left me to get ready.  When she returned she started the massage, downer was the heavy towel laid across my lower back down to mid calf,  on a muggy wet day this was not a good feeling.  The massage was good and the towel was moved away from areas while they were being massaged only to return once she moved on.  It scouted some erogenous areas, but no prolonged touching occurred, it was a bit hard to read if extras were available and I wasn't super keen to ask early first time up at the venue without getting the lay of the land.  As the end of the massage approached, I mentioned I was hoping for a bit more, the response was a sigh and that she did not do that but could organise someone who could.  On my eager assent she disappeared and two minutes later Joy came in.  

Joy was a Taiwanese girl (she mentioned on a 12 month tourist visa working to get the 12 month extension), 7/10 for looks but 8/10 for a hot tight body.  With the annoying towel out of the way, Joy started the happy ending part of the massage and she did a great job with some oil and lots of eye contact. No touching under clothes, but plenty over.  After five minutes of really good hand relief I exploded almost hitting my chin with the early shots.  The "tip" was left to me and as I sometimes do in these situations I may have been a bit generous with $50 on the plate, she seemed to  think this was a pretty good tip and we left on happy terms.

Next time I'll know to hint at what I am after more strongly.  Recommended for a good massage and what turned out to be a happy and memorable ending.

Cheers,

Hommo

Person's Name :  Quinny (/Queenie)

Establishment : Healthland Spa

Date of Visit : 16th Sept 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :   248 Russell Street, Melbourne CBD, 03-9663-8789

Hours of Business : 10am - 9pm

Rates :  $55 for 45min massage (+ $40 extra)

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, RnT, HJ 

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

The online presence (gumtree reviews, other) looks legit so I was a bit apprehensive, but frankly it looks like it's worth a punt (location, decor) so after a bit of harder googling I found a reference to "most of the girls offer extras" on another site and just did a walk-in at about 7pm.

I was greeted by Quinny who is attractive and very pleasant, although English is not a strong suit.  I always prefer an hour, especially that day as I had a sore back and was actually keen for a massage anyway (so would not have been shattered if legit), but Quinny only had 30 min.  I was going to politely decline and amicably leave but she offered 45 min.  Good enough and also good thing wanting to please the customer.  Sorry to the person who may have had a booked appointment at 730, but the process never felt rushed and I think we went over 45 min.  She also may have just wanted to get home early - it was a cool night.

I was led up front staircase to the massage rooms.  The decor is very simple RnT - old carpet, dimly lit but pleasant and clean - nice hippy new age crap music playing;  you know what it looks like already.  I expect that legit customers go up the other way because that was brightly lit and looked a bit more clinical.  Only possible downside is that the massage room walls don't go fully to the roof, which I can find distracting but there was noone else about for most of the time.

Room was warm and the massage table good quality.  Discussed price for $55 / 45 min ("and how much for a bit extra?" -->  "$40").  A bit uppish for Melb at $95 for 45min, especially as she politely declined to take any clothing off herself but I pushed on.  Glad I did.

Not much of a talker (good thing) but polite and friendly.  The massage itself was very good - the lady was trained and clearly able to massage professionally, and was fine for no underwear (for me at least) - I hate oil on undies.  Massage was good (firm, comprehensive and worked out some back and shoulder knots) that I was completely unknotted and starting to even get sleepy when she gave me a nudge to flip.  Well, she also gets my vote for the extra - there was a pretty decent technique going on; not just a haphazard flick or two, but making a real effort.  No BJ or hint thereof just firm and well applied massaging.  Hot towel followed for a cleanup and I was on my way.

edit2> agree with OP that the towel movement (which must be a venue policy or trained as such) was a bit distracting but as I had pre-negotiated extras it didn't make me think there were none.  Strong agreement on quality of HJ.

I tipped and will return.

Yes, that's it Fartichoke.  Obviously I knew the price but given it was clear what we were negotiating, was happy to pay a premium over advert.
Fast work on tidying and commenting to this thread.

Date of Visit : April 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 248 Russell Street Melbourne Vic Phone: 03 9663 8789 http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_1...ART-TODAY.html

Hours of Business : 10am-9pm

Age : 23

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian (thai)

Services Provided : Handjob

Value for money/recommend? : Fair price for the experience

My experience/comments : This was my first experience in melbourne and I saw the ads on locanto so why not lets give it a shot. I walked in around noon and was greeted by a tanned girl Cassie. I can tell straight off the bat that shes Thai. So I chose the 45 mins session and go in and undress. She was pretty babe, long sexy legs and pretty big tits. 
After like 30 mins of massage I flipped over and she asked if I wanted any service. I asked how much she charges and she said 50. Thats a bit pricey but she has the looks and hands so why not. I agreed to it and gave her 50 in cash (bring cash if ur going she doesnt take card). She oiled up and hands and started stroking and rubbing my balls. She let me touched her legs and tits which got me hard in like 5 seconds. I would say her tits are at least a D cup. I tried putting my hands underneath her clothes but she said no only the outside. I continue rubbing her hits with one hand and the other hand on her smooth tanned legs. I had some happy endings in japan and all but this one is pretty good. I would say its one of the best Ive been to. 
After like 10 mins I came and she cleaned it with a warm towel. We had a conversation and she said other girls in there provide the same service but they may charge differently.
So guys any girls there will offer u the service haha. For 100 bucks total thats pretty expensive but the service was really good for me. So I could say its worth it 

the number is on the title xD

Person's Name : Lily

Establishment :   Wellspring Massage

Date of Visit :  01/06/2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 248 Russell St, Melbourne CBD, upstairs  (walk-in when i saw it, don't have number)

Hours of Business : 11am - 8pm

Rates : 60 mins / $65

Age : 24

Size/shape : Size 10-12, C cup, a little curvy, but not fat

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean (so she said)

Services Provided : RNT

Value for money/recommend? : Yeah.. the girls are all young and friendly, not over-priced.

My experience/comments : I was walking through the city and saw this place, thought I'd try my luck.  I went through the glass door, to a desk they have on the bottom floor.  I rang the bell and a young girl comes downstairs.  I liked her bubbly attitude and paid $65 for an hour.  She took me up to a room and I got ready.  A  different girl walked in and was wearing a loose white T-shirt and denim shorts, she had those thick asian legs, not from being fat, but being short, if you know what I mean. Room seem clean and comfortable.  She said her name was Lily, she was friendly and talkative, said she was a Korean student.  

She gave a pretty standard rub down and started to play around my inner thigh and brushed against my tackle a few times.  Here she asked me to turn over and then asked if I wanted a HJ, so I said yes and she said that it was $30, so I agreed.  She was full of smiles and the action was firm, not mechanical and I enjoyed the rhythm.  I tought about asking if she'd do topless but didn't.  I blew my load and she cleaned me up.  This room had a shower so she brought me a fresh towel and said I can use the facilities, so I did, got dressed, handed her $30 and went on my way!

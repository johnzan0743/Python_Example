My experience/comments:

Lately, I have seen this shop advertise on the L and locally around the area, they have many adverts with different wording, so if you do a search for just the phone number you can see some of their adverts. The pics on the ads are not what your getting 

It's located at the Mill Park Stables stopping centre on Childs Rd, it's a small shopping centre and it's located right at the back next to a nail salon and a hairdresser. So plenty of parking and it's at a part of the centre that doesn't get much foot traffic so if your the type that is a nervous entering these shops, this one should be ok.

I didn't make a booking, just rocked up on the Sunday arvo and the shop was empty, establishment was ok, nothing fancy. As I walked in I was greeted by a lady called Nicole. Found out later she only works on Sunday and Monday's.
I think there might be two ladies working as there is two small massage rooms. The rooms are quite small, just enough for some side tables and a massage table. However there is no door, only a curtain as a door for privacy.
I didn't think much of it, Nicole is a 30 something from PRC, her english is ok, not much of a talker unless you start the convo, she is average hight and build looks to be ok.

I opted for 30min for $50, their were other prices, 1hr and so on but I didn't take notice as to how much it cost so went for the 30min. When I visit a new place for the 1st time I tend not to ask up front what service is on offer so I tend to wait towards the middle and this place was no different. After I parted with my hard earned $50, I stripped and onto the massage table, these were the ones with the round cushion for your head/face and you see the floor.
They use those disposable white sheets (tissue like) for the table and looking around I can see they have a few on the side table which makes me assume it's for one time use and the they change it over for new punters. The massage was pretty average and nothing to talk about, after she worked all of my back and legs, I can feel the teasing of my crack and balls, indicating, ok, extras are on the menu  That's when it's time for me to ask, she said $30 for HandJob, if I wanted touching it's $50 with handjob, too pricey, so I opted for just a HJ. Didn't try to bring the price down, since we all love a good punt at a great price, don't forgot, these ladies are human beings so in all my punts, I never negotiate.

She left the room and came back with a tub of warm water and a towel to clean the oil she used for the massage, now just a warning, the towel may not be fresh, just rinse and repeat I think. After the clean up of my back and legs, time for the flip, on came the baby oil, with light tugging with one hand and the other playing with my balls and crack, she over used the oil so the oil was doing most of the job. Just one motion/routine, it didn't vary so very mechanical, I havn't released in a few days so after a few minutes I crossed the line, cleaned me up and off I went.

She only works Sunday and Monday's, may have to come back and try another lady, as this one was just average and pretty bland, not much of a talker unless you start the convo, will I return? Maybe, if I'm in the area and need a release, I might come back. Don't expect FS at these place, just another RnT. I'm guessing your mileage may vary if your a regular.

Happy Punting

Hi all,

Just thought I'd give an update for this place as I have been going here on and off since my last visit.

Not going to write another review as I feel this just more of an update than a another review,, they advertise quite a bit on Locanto, below is their latest ad:
http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_5...mill-park.html

Ever since I've been back there I have been seeing an older lady called Yen, she is from PRC with reasonably good English, reason why I got back is Yen does a great massage, the 30 hours session doesn't do it justice so I always opt for the 1 hours session to get a really nice massage. She works there 5 days a week.

Don't let the adverts for this place fool you, there is never any young girls that I'm aware of, only the older type ones, I have seen one other lady called Josie, her massage skills is not as good as Yen.

Price is still the same, 30min for $50 or 1hr for $70, fully clothed HJ is on offer for $30. Sorry to say but that is all your going to get out of this place, I thought YMMV but this isn't the case here in saying that Yen does a great HJ to finish off the massage.

This is right in my home territory and I have often been tempted to go in and give it a go, but cannot take the risk as I know a lot of people in this area and just my luck to get sprung. Thanks for the review xs4all4me, after reading this I certainlywont bother taking the risk of getting sprung.

No worries, this place is near my territory as well  if you haven't seen the place, it's on the far side near the hotel, so it doesn't get much foot traffic so if your quick you can get in without being seeing  Just wear a big hoodie and some sunnies and a quick dash in.
The doors is always open not like some places where it's shut 

The only bad thing about this place is, level above is an office and the floor is pretty thin, there is a lady who wears high heels and when she walks, which is quite often, you can hear her foot steps pretty loud and it echos, kinda breaks the mood, but you get used to it after a few visits, but for first timers, this can kill the mood

Oh I have seen it many times mate, as I say been tempted but never entered. Nice and close and handy for me if it wasnt so risky, no pun intended there with the word handy. Hoodie and sunnies, haha, good idea. 
Many years ago I was waiting patiently sitting, waiting for Ruby in the waiting area at 196 Elgar road. I could see the security camera screen. A punter rings the bell and sure enough looked like someone out of a spy movie, face fully covered with the hoodie and the sunnies. So funny.

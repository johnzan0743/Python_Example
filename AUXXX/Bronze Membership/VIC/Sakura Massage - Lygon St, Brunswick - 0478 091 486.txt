Thursday 23/5/19 , $60 plus 50 extra HJ, Can;t remember the girls name

Feeling toey, I pulled up near a massage joint in Lygon St Brunswick. Non-descript, relatively tidy looking place on a corner. OPEN sign flashing. I go to the desk and there's an older Asian women there, I ask for a massage, 45 minute $60, as we're talking a young Asian girl, uni student looking type, cute and slim, comes in the doorway from the corridor and retreats. "Is that the massuaese?" I ask "Yes, yes haha" mamasanlaughs, which seems a good sign. She comes back down the corridor, friendly, english is pretty good and she leads me into the room. Room is tiny, but clean, walls and doors are thin. Can hear the traffic, bit weird being meters from a busy street, getting naked and jerked off by a stranger, but hey...

She leaves me to strip and I get on the table, face down. Returns quickly, she's wearing jeans and sneakers and a long sleeved top. Not very sexy so hopes are getting low. She starts on a nice, medium firmness, massage. Seems business like about it but after about ten minutes, she lingers on the legs a bit and lightens her stroke so I think "Maybe we're on". I turn over, towel falls off a bit and she sees I'm half erect. Doesn't blink, starts rubbing my chest. I ask her "is (I make a jerking off motion) ok?" she says "Yes, extra $60" I say "I have a $50, cool?" She accepts, so I take the towel off and she starts rubbing the balls and the perineum. She seems happy enough and relaxed, which is good because if they seem resentful/bored/irritated about being in a room jerking off strangers then I can barely get over the line. 

Her technique is good, doesn't grab and tug on it, puts her hand on top of my cock making a little tunnel with all her fingers running parallel with my cock and gently teases with her finger tips in an upwards motion. Returns to the balls and repeats, each time gripping a little harder and faster on my cock. I'm hard as fuck now, so she cups my balls and starts a vigorous handjob, and soon enough I'm done.  

Tidy up, dress, pay her the extra, and try not to sprint as soon I get flung out the door for the walk of shame to my car.

ichiro, you can do this and even better in some places in Melbourne if you read reviews, know what you are doing, and are not easily conned by some girl just because she is about to play with your dick. Some punters have more money than brains.

Markg620, if I had just paid some girl $50 for a clothed HJ on top of the massage price, I would sprint out the door to the car in shame.

I agree with all the above comments. 

But in fairness to the OP. I must admit, that when the soft feminine hands, of an attractive young therapist, lightly touch my throbbing knob, my negotiating skills are  somewhat diminished.

I have learnt from reading Jersey's reviews, to negotiate at the start, and be prepared to walk if VFM is not available. 

It is really easy to be in control, with a flaccid penis.

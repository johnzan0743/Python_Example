My experience/comments : 

drove past the store at night and saw it open late and gave it a punt. Room is a bit shady and floor is slippery like oil is everywhere. Undress and laid flat. They use a lot of oil for a mediocre massage (more touching than a massage). Light accidental brushes nothing more to excite you. Turn over and lots of chest/groin massage until you're up and ask for extras while looking at you. I needed a release and gave in. $30 for HJ with touching outside although i was to rub outside the panties. HJ was rough and not enjoyable. I came eventually and cleaned up. 

I don't recommend her but maybe other girls are more experienced

Value for money/recommend? : Massage on its own was wort it but extras were a waste of money.

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

I called in to Bayside massage the other day. I have always found it to be a place where you can get a good quality massage AND a happy ending. Most other massage places seem to be one or the other. So Bayside is good but the extras tend to be very expensive.
I had a massage from a dark skinned girl from South Africa named Sheeba. She gave a terrific, firm back massage that was as good as any theraputic massage I have had. On the flip she asked if I wanted anything extra. She offered to do a nude bodyslide and finish with a titty fuck (I reckon she's a floppy E Cup) for $100. I said I only have $35 left in my wallet its all yours for whatever you want to give me. She suggested the EFTPOS machine but I said I'm cash only I'll bring more money next time but right now thats all I got.
So she gave me a rather lack lustre hand job. I guess she felt thats all I deserved.
In hind sight I wish I had not spent the $35. I could have walked out feeling great after an awesome massage. Instead I walked out after an awesome massage and a disappointing HJ. The overall experience was mediocre.

So I can definitely recommend her massage but skip the extras and save up for visit to one of the brothels in the area (easier said than done when you've got hard on)

Saw this place on this site but cant find the thread. Went on one of the really hot days and when I arrived I saw a very nice African girl. It was about 4pm and I was first client so my hopes were up. Got naked and waited for the massage. Tried my best to chat her up but got the I have a boyfriend and he is the one so it was looking bleak. All round good massage which just left me frustrated. She is going back to Uni when it starts so if you are interested better hurry.

Came to this place and saw Marilyn last month. Did topless for extra 30. It was ok. Nothing to shout about.

Mate,you are clearly new to this caper because $70 should be buying you way more than that.What you do with your money is your business but throwing it at massage girls like a drunken sailor just means that it gets more expensive for every other bloke. 
Do your research on here and you will see that you can get a tug for as low as $20 or $30 extra and probably cop a feel as well.There are still some places were you can get a nude half hour with a tug included for $70 all up so paying a girl $70 extra just for a tug is just plain dumb.
Use your brain,not your wallet

TMT you appear to have TMT on your hands.  You're always criticising people for what they are willing to spend on a RnT. 

Mate you're going send yourself bonkers worrying about things you have no control over.  Give it up and concentrate on what you enjoy doing.

You have already flamed me once for saying something similar on another thread so I am awaiting your response.  If you take the time to read the detail of the review, you may start to understand why some punters are willing to pay more for what they perceive to be a better service.

Thanks for listening.....

This discussion of the Political Economy of the Massage business needs to end.

If it doesn't desist, I will move it to http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f35/as...it-rant-26454/
where I think it belongs.

No more carping, and no more friendly advice in a review thread.

I called in here last Thursday arvo. Receptionist was the ML. Non Asian, but terrible English. Looks 6/10. Long story short. I walked.

Originally we negotiated a nude handy for $70.00 on top of massage fee. When I quizzed her on the deal, it was $70 extra for a topless tug, & nude was not available.

The whole vibe had an air of rip off about it, so I walked.

Did you overpay? I think $50 for nude HJ and DATY is ok value. The additional $30 is a tad overs but if it was as you say a good CBJ then I would've happily paid that. 
$150 for the hour with those benefits is good value IMHO. I have paid more for less. Then again I have paid less for more as usual YMMV.

If you got a full hour and a good massage $150 is good. Remember you can have FS for $120, or less in a brothel.

My experience/comments :

I saw this place advertised on Locanto and thought I would check it out. It's local for me but not so local I may be seen entering the place. It turns out the shop itself is very discrete with no signage usually associated with suburban massage shops. It looks like it could be some kind of office so the embarrassment factor of entering from a busy main road is removed, you could be visiting an accountant! 

I rang the bell and Molly came and ushered straight into the massage room which was freshly painted, well laid out and clean. The wasll are full floor to ceiling walls and doors which I prefer to the 3/4 height walls and curtained entrances of some establishments I've visited. Asked for a 1/2 hour massage and hand over the pineapple, read the usual meaningless sign about no sexual service, and got on the table. When Molly came back she proceeded to give me a better than reasonable massage, working out a couple of kinks in my shoulder which feels great right now. She has good English skills, but all attempts to engage her in conversation were met with miserable failure, she's definitely not one for chatting! 

Towards the end of the of the face down sessions there was a little playing with the crown jewels but not really very much, and unfortunately her technique there was a sign of things to come. On the flip she asked me if I wanted extras and was told it was $30 for hj + $20 for nude. I decided to go the whole hog and paid up the extra pineapple. Her hj technique was strictly mechanical with the aim of getting me cum as quickly as possible. She allowed only minimal touching of her trim and trimmed body and absolutely zero eye contact. Anyway, nature took its course and the inevitable conclusion of a dick massage was reached. 

In the end I got what I came for, a good massage and an orgasm, so I can't complaint too much. However Molly was very cold and distant and her technique is not worth $100. Just my personal opinion.

Well not for me anyway. Her heart was there, but it was firmly kept in her chest.

Probably better for you to take a punt and add to the knowledge database, Sither.

That was my first visit. I didn't see anyone else there, but judging from the sounds coming from the corridor from time to time there was a least one other girl working there that night.

Went there on Friday and saw Scarlett. Topless but was wearing gstring. She looks good and the lomi was great. Exchange was an extra $30 but it wasn't enjoyable. She wasn't into it. Got to know a little later that she has a bf. asked her if she gets horny at work and she said she just tuned off. Lol! The worst part about this massage was paid for 1 hour but finished after 45 mins. Saw a couple if hot girls(could be Olivia, Katy or piper). Definitely going back there again and asking for piper. Prob not jasmin

Don't bother with Olivia, wears a G-string and no action on the flip. Does do exchange but obviously no touching the meow cos the panties are on. DIY was available for an extra 20. WTF. If it cost 20 every time I jerked myself i would never have bus money..LOL. Oh and talked constantly about her boyfriend . So in overview. Decent rig and rack but very ordinary massage , kinda pretty, but no release= waste of time and money.

I popped in again last Friday after lunchtime and was offered either an appointment with either Olivia or Piper.  Needless to say I chose Piper and was led into a room to undress and hop on to the table.  She remembered me from my previous visit and asked if I wanted it to go the same way.  I indicated the pineapple sitting on top of my clothing and away she went.  The massage this time was 20 minutes massaging my back and legs before indicating I should flip.  The next half hour was alternating between slow teasing tugs and massaging over my chest and legs that kept bringing me to the close but not over the line until I shot my load all over her hand and my stomach.  After cleaning me off, she had me turn over for a neck massage until time was up and then wiped me down with hot towels.

Glad for the heads up Tomthumb, I didn't leave with blue balls

Had a crack with the new girl Chanel..Better than average looking, and body. Only been there a week or so I think.Ordinary massage, did exchange for extra $30. G string stayed on...so not sure how they can advertise as nude lomi??? Anyway plenty of play around her bits, tits and crack. Pussy rub on outside of panties , but no cigar with the extras..she doesn't do the " release". Perhaps more on offer a little down the track once she settles in and realises how much her little coin box is worth when she starts giving wristies a go!
Happy punting gents!!

Just replying to an earlier query. 

Avoid Katy like the plague. Zero interest in even a HJ. I stupidly booked the exchange based on their pics when they launched. She is not a slim girl and was mechanical in her approach....which was being kind.

I went to this place again last week.  Earlier at this post,  I said that I had a booking with piper with no luck at the tug.  I must said that that booking wasn't with Piper,  it was Tara (realised after looking at the pictures,  but I am sure she told me her name was Piper).  I had a booking with Piper,  and tug is available for $50 and exchange massage for $30.  I really enjoyed her service and I plan to go back this month

Try Roxy. She doesn't work much these days, but if u can get a booking she is good value. Decent rub, pretty good body. Fit athletic, smallish breasts. Does the extras and if u play ur cards right might get a little more than just a HJ. She is down to earth also and can hold a conversation.

Went there in May this year. Got a young 20yo hippie uni chick. Very white skin. Nice boobs. But no hint of any extras. I was nude, she was fully nude as the Lomi massage is advertised. Massage was good, she was nice and chatty but nothing eventuated. Went home and batted off very disappointed.

Varied results here shall we say, depending on who you get , how they feel , what they think of you I guess. Had three visits, pleasant but no "extra " ending which doesnt mean it doesn't happen I can safely say, I didnt ask by the way , though massaging a delightful naked women is a fine way to spend an hour in the morning. YMMV which is easy enough to find out, I've seen two of them now, one generally not getting a good wrap but it wasn't so bad. Prices on the ads.

 Jasmine, Mitcham Vic, Tree of Life
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Jasmine
Establishment : TOL Massage
Date of Visit : 3 August
Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Burwood Hwy,  VIC - 9874 1123 - search TOL on Locanto
Hours of Business : 11am - 8pm
Rates : 60mins / 100
Age : 25..ish
Size/shape : 12, b cup max, firm booty, long brunette
Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie
Services Provided : B2B / RnT
Value for money/recommend? : No.  Never return.
My experience/comments :
Called during lunch time to see who's available. Saw Jasmine's photo (back only) and liked her figure, so decided to go with her instead of Buffy who seemed like a wicked girl.

This place is on a street corner and on the second floor. It's one of the most awkward experience waiting in the waiting room, opposite the reception desk. You get to see every client walking in and out, and so do they.

Was ushered into the room by Jasmine, who had just finished another client. One thing I don't like is asking about what you want directly, which is what she did. Anyway she has a banging body and she admitted that she actually works out so if you like booties, she won't disappoint. 

She used only one hand massaging my leg for ten mins and I could tell she was checking her phone at the same time. Backslide was quite average and it was more of a backpress. She's open to exchange and reacted strongly to touching.

Finished with a HJ but she didn't seem very interested.

Works Monday &amp; Monday to Saturday

So many mixed reviews here, been three times, only seen Jasmine once though it was just mutual massage. Chanel is a bit of a case , great body, personality average and flat out refused the suggestion of anything extra, though she has in the past. Its a fair dinkum Blue Balls experience where YMMV though, not visited the Richmond shop yet.

Establishment : Tree of life massage 

Date of Visit : 11/07/2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : http://melbourne.backpage.com.au/Bod...slides/6905527
Hours of Business : 10 am till 8pm

Rates : 1/2  $70   45 $90  hour $110  

Age : late 20's

Size/shape : advertised as voluptuous redhead  actual about 5/8 redhead with a good deal of padding 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie

Services Provided : nude lomi massage

Value for money/recommend? : probably not

My experience/comments : Decided to see what the nude lomi was like after talking to my regular ML
So after seeing the twitter feeds over the days or so of $10 off an hour session i thought why not TOFTT
So after making the booking and being told that today was cash only as the eftpos was down , i grabed some xash as of i went
When i got there was greeted by the receptionist and had a chat while waiting for my booking 
(Some Intel recieved that the sign out front  some of the adds and eftpos down due to the boss not paying some of the bills)

So back to the deed so to speak paid my cash was talen to the room by Isabel who had the same look as me of don't i know you from somewhere as we discovered have probably  seen each other at the local shops..
Anyway  long story short was offered exchange masage at $30 10 mins or $50 15 mins
Took the 10 mins so i could gauge my massage skills before try it on my regular 

We began with the hot oil and decent rub/massage al i can say is it was ok nothing to write home about but none the less quite relaxing 
About 30 mins in after the back and legs were done i was asked to get up for the exchange 
Did my 10  woth and was surprised to hear that i haven't lost my skills 
Back onto the table for a decent albeit qwick front oil over i was given a sort of hot towel off
And time was up 

WIR   only if the place was to improve and i knew that extras were on offer
But from what i could gather that wont be happening soon as they have had a high turn over of staff in the last few months and with the Richmond set up i think they have stretched themselves a bit thin on the cash flow 


  That all folks

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :  511A Whitehorse Rd, Mitcham VIC 3132, 0456 584 097

Hours of Business : 10am till 8 pm

Rates : $110 an hour

Age : 50+

Size/shape : C cup, saggy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian

Services Provided : MAssage, HJ and body slide

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments :

Been away fair bit and out of punting action. And this year I got back to Melbourne I will try my best to make punt I could afford. 
I have been seeing this ad bit too much and been wanting to try this place. 
As i understand there is a new owner/management at this place. 
Had evening free so decided to make booking and I went there. 
There was a young Asian lady at the reception who showed me to the room. Just before I get in the room I asked to use washroom. 
When i returned to the room, it was very dark, and Sarah was already there. She is easily 50+ with wrinkled face and saggy tummy boobs, arms etc. 
She is friendly and way bit too chatty. Also a bit quirky. Everything I answer she says it back to me. 
She also removed her clothes and starts giving me massage and asks me right away if I am interested in any extra. 
She told me 3 option - from $100 to $200. I went with $150 option, I can hardly ever afford to do so. I don;t know why but I decided to go for today. 
Her massage skills are nothing to write about, just below average. Asks too many questions, often bit to personal about work, where you live etc and try to talk dirty, but not sexy or arousing. 
She tell me touching her privates was for most expensive package only. Whatever, when I tried to touched her breast, she moved back a bit with a smile, but still. 
Boring session continues with lack-luster stroked slapping huge amount of oil slapped around. 
And then she tell me, only 2 mins to go and she wants to finish me off, so suddenly grabs me, and started jack hammering. I asked to slow down couple of times, eventually I finished, she throws half a pack of tissues and baby wipes and cleans me up. And gives me hug good bye. 

WIR - maybe for other. :P

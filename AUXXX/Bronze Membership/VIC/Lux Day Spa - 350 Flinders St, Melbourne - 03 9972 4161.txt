My experience/comments : Rooms are really small and walls are very thin. The massage was good and firm. Extras are a bit pricey, but it didn't feel rushed or mechanical, so that's alright. Amanda has nice soft skin and looks cute. She works Mondays, and on other days at another shop on Queens st, but I didn't get the address for that.

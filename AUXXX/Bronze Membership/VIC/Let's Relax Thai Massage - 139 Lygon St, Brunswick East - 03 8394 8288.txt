My experience/comments : 
I was in Lygon st and decided look up the new shop on my phone which was only a minute walk from my location so off I went. I walked in and saw the beautiful Summer from the Preston shop at the counter and started talking with her about the new shop and so on and that i was there for a massage. She does mostly reception work and massages when the other girls are busy(which they weren't, dam). Anyway I book for an hour and she leads me to the room and says the girl will be with me shortly. I undress leaving the jocks on knowing they're legit and lie down and wait. The girl knocks on the door and comes in and I was very impressed, just what i like, slim and cute. She asked me how i would like my massage and if there is anywhere i would like her to concentrate and said I medium and told her to where concentrate. She then proceeded to give me an amazingly good massage, they sure no how to find good masseuses at Let's relax. Bella's English was not the best but who cares i will be seeing her regularly from now on.

Date of Visit : 6/3/2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0404 608 815 HEALTH & RELAXATION MASSAGE ARE HOT FOR U...., Nunawading

Hours of Business : 10 - 8pm 7 Days

Rates : $40 1/2 hr + extras

Age : early 20's

Size/shape : Slight frame, small tits.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese 

Services Provided : Massage, R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Pretty standard

My experience/comments : Thought I'd try this place as it was new. Found the ad in Locanto and it looks like they have only just moved in as the signage on the shopfront is really nothing to do with the service inside. 
Abbey gave an okay massage and took about 2 seconds to convince that a R&T was something she'd offer. She accepted $30 but reckoned it was usually $40 - this was on top of the $40 half hour massage.
She did a pretty good job at that, wouldn't nude up or go any further and was okay with roaming hands so long as they didn't disappear under her clothing.

Hi, I put a deposit down on a new matress  in nuawading and heading to work, I popped in here on the off chance id see a gem.   I met a mid 20's girl who told me she had a special girl, and out of a room walks an early 20's Asian girl size 8-10 wearing a Japanese like school uniform with a tie.   Now before you get excited she had slacks attatched to the skirt.  I looked at her and thought.  "how on earth am I going to get a read on this chick in this oddball outfit".  I walked out a broken man.Hopefully a session with Sophia this weds at am pure massage will repair me.

A friend of mine who also frequents the RnT scene contacted this girl as well.  He made a booking for for this week, but a few days ago he received an abusive text message from the number that so called Lisa was using.  Basically called him a cunt, because he is contacting dirty whores. And that he will pay, and that his family will be disappointed in him.  WTF!!??

Im glad your enjoying the sailor outfit girl, but when I met her, I found her hair looking like string and her pants attatched to her schoolgirl outfit was hilarious.

They have been closed for a while. I visited this place last Thur and I regret about it. I shouldn't enter the premise.The windscreen of  My car was damaged by some unforeseeable bolt. I spent $200+ to replace it. the total cost of this massage experience cost me $300+.Just a Bad Move!

the jenny I saw was tall in a black dress with gold colour near the strappings, size 10 with hair tied back, she told me she only works Fridays, but as her period is due this week, she may have squeezed in another shift, I thought jenny was chinese,and  from prev review, will do oral pleasure

There is a Jenny/Genny who works at ideal massage, opposite knox on Saturday, and she goes off on having her pussy rubbed and grinds it hard. I've definitely seen her at Pleasant road as well, but didn't get her working name at Pleasant road as I didn't stay with her, may be the same girl.

What more do you want from the Pleasant Rd crew???? They already do pretty ,much anything. I still consider them rather pricey though, especially for a 45 minute to 1 hr visit. Hopefully the prices will come down

My experience/comments : 

I often walk past this place and decided to go in to sort out some back pain from the gym but also thought I'd give it a punt after reading the review above.
I was met at the front desk by the girl mentioned above (forgotten name now), she looked like a Tomboy with short cut hair but petite. Not really my type d if she'd offered extras I might not have taken them. 
I didn't have a booking but they easily slipped me in, taking me to the first room on the left which had two massage beds. I quickly stripped off and lay down. I was met shortly after by the same girl who lay a huge sheet over me and started with Thai massage jumping on my back and warming me up. I wasn't getting the impression if was leading anywhere and just closed my eyes and went with the ride. 
On the flip she kept me covered with the sheet and massages me all over. I must say she was really good and she really did work my back muscles which really needed it. She used up the entire hour and I left satisfied after only spending $60.
This place offers private health rebates and seems quite legit. It may really depend on who is booked or who you get at the desk at the time. I would go back for the massage alone.

Thanks for fantastic review.

I saw their ad. For waxing & special of $20. extra would include massage.

I have been curious about this place & you have confirmed that my instincts were accurate.

Congratulations on a sensational punt.

Elfang - no not them in the photo. MikeMelb - sorry I should have paid attention in English class in school! Pancho - yeah I haven't been that excited since I banged the next door neighbour's wife when I was 17.

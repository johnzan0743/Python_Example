Visited on the weekend looking for a good Thai massage, Marj was the only lady available as the other lady was busy.

Paid 45 for 30 mins. Ushered into room and a typical Thai Massage setup with bed on floor. Noticed a nicely presented box of tissues in corner which is always a good sign. Undress fully and lie on bed. Marj comes in and does a hard pressing massage with a towel including kneeling on me for extra pressure. 

After about 10 minutes then oil comes out and a great deep tissue massage with very sensual strokes and teasing around my inner thigh which starts to make me hard. 

Asked to turn over and Marj asks straight away if i would like any extras. She asks for $50 but I negotiate down to $40.

She proceeds to give me a lovely double handed tug until i explode everywhere.

Cleans me up with a hot towel afterwards and am on my way,

On the way out i notice another very cute Thai girl who just finished her massage and will visit again to see her.

This place is posing as a professional shop but sure there is usual tug on offer with each girl.

Definitely will return to try others, as very good massage and nice service.

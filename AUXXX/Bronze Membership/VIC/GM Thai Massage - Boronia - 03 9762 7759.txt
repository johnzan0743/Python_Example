Services Provided : HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Not really. Not having been there before or being a walk in I was not sure what I was going to get. The massage itself was $5-$10 cheaper then a other places but the extras weren't really open to negotiation, but that could've come down to the masseuse.

My experience/comments : 
first time at this parlour and wasn't sure what to expect. There are a few massage venues closely situated near here and will be crossing this one off my list. Tucked in behind the Dan Murphys.
Walking in the door they have attempted to capture a Balinese/Thai feel but it looks very cluttered. The women behind the punter is a lot older but am quite sure she operated the premises. Room I was lead to was clean but was a make shift set up as the flooring was a rug covering the concrete, the table itself was wood then foam covered by multiple layers of sarongs and towels. 

She enters the room after I've stripped and laying on the table. Very fit body but the incredible amount of makeup she wears is a real turn off. The massage is actually pretty good. About half way through she asks if I would like just my back done or if I wanted front and back. Obviously I chose the latter. 

After turning on my front and getting to the buisiness end, she tells me it's $50 HJ, clothes on. I told her that was a bit rich and tried to either bring her down to $30 or make the $50 better value. She wasn't really interested in changing her opening price or deal so I declined. If she was a stunner (less makeup), and friendlier I might have been more inclined to part with a pinapple. Id rather try one of the 4 other places nearby and see what they have to offer.

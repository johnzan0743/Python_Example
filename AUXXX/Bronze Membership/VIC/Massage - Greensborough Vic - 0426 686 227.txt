My experience/comments :
This is the second time I have been here, went in Jan to see what it was like and went back to see for follow up...
Monday arvo, the shop was very quiet and only one person working...she was pretty excited to see me, think it had been pretty slow trade for the day!
Opted for the 30 min job, taken to the room, stripped down and waited.
Sunny returns and asks what I would like, I ask for mainly legs as they were rather tired after some running on the weekend.....she giggles and starts to massage....my back!
The question is asked, "massage ok?", yes its fine but can you please massage my legs as they are kind of tight....giggles an answer but dosent move to my legs and instead moves to my shoulders...
By this stage I am just amused.  When she does ask a question, I answer, she giggles and says, "you funny man"....
If you could call what we being done to my back (not legs) a massage I would go jump, it was merely oil being slapped all over and hands being flipped, flopped and slapped all over, rather disappointing and rather odd!
When she did finally move to my legs it was weird wipes over with no pressure....the little fella was staying little, no movement at all and it was around this point that I opted in my head to not take any extra services that may be offered.
On the flip she started rubbing my chest and occasionally moving down to towel that was still covering my mid section, she moved the towel and asked if I would extra?  THree fingers raised, $30...  Well seeing as the little man couldn't even get hard I have no idea why she asked??
I declined the offer to which she was very surprised and again told me I was funny man....
After a few more weird strokes she again asked if I was sure....again I declined...you funny man!
After this second experience I would say that my time here is done, the massage was crap and even though $30 is not bad value I would prefer it not to be my mum doing it!

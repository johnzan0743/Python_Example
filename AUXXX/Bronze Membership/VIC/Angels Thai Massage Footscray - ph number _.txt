My experience/comments : Pretty high exposure massage shop right next to the Pizza Hut. Being shy like me, it's a bit hard to walk in through the front door but luckily they have plenty of parking & entrance in the back. Been here a couple of times since they open last year, new facilities & mostly viet girls with very nice & friendly service. Usually there are 2 girls working, but you'd want Lisa who's a tall, smokin' hot viet girl with curves in the all the right places  I wouldn't count on the massage but she is very obedient on the table and her face & boobs will make you wanna off load straightaway. The challenge would be to last longer and enjoy that athletic bod bouncing infront of you...

Services that I received for $100 were a 10 min massage, CBJ, then straight into reverse cowgirl, doggy and finally finishing with a missionary  all in all great experience for 30 mins 


I think Lisa only works Fri - Sun, but I've also had a great experience with another nice looking viet girl (works Thurs?), though not as hot as Lisa.

I really don't think this place has a phone number... I found it passing through in the car. 

BTW, I think I got the name confused with the lady from another shop, this lady's name is Jenny.

Have fun punting!

this store has a piece of paper on the front and back door but is still open. I haven't walked past to see the piece of paper but might be a warning of its activity...

bugger another one bites the dust. Is it illegal to enter them if they have a notice if you wanted to just have a normal massage does anyone know?

I might try go past this long weekend to see what the paper is about. It's rare to see a piece of paper and still open for business. Did a quick google search and news headline says they're stuffed... but link doesn't lead anywhere.

Yep, paper notice of illegal activity. it's still open as i saw some Indians walk in but I wouldn't go in even if the ML was banging hot knowing cops can raid it anytime

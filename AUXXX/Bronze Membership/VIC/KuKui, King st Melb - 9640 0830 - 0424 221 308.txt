My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)
Its my first visit here. Located just around the corner from my office it was too easy to call in at lunch time. Entering the shop its an impressive space with high ceilings and polished floors. The receptionist assigned me to the room and when I was waiting naked on the table Bella bounces in. She is young pretty, full of personality and good English. Joking as she goes, she performs a reasonably pleasant back and leg massage. Then negotiates the extras the hj is $50 and nude is $100. By this time Ive already decided its going to be a one and only visit here and opt for a hj only.  I roll over, the hj is pleasant and I soon finish. While she cleans me up she is talking about her next booking with a regular. As I leave I notice as i leave its only 20 minutes since I arrived into the room.

My experience/comments : I had visited this place earlier in the year and was surprised to find an Aussie girl, Rosalie, working amongst the asian girls here. Unfortunately she left shortly after. her service was great - nude exchange massage but expensive ($180 all up). On my next visit I had a boring asian girl and didn't bother with any extras other than the average HJ she offered. So it's taken sometime to try here again. I checked in and was shown to a room by a fairly cute again girl. I stripped off and waited on the table face down. In came a lovely looking caucasian girl which I wasn't expecting. Not stunning but a pretty face and what looked like a trim figure under her skirt and top. The massage started and she had a lovely touch (apparently she is studying naturopathy) and was easy to talk to. All the signs were there with the hands running between my but cheeks and me sighing to let her know how much I was enjoying it. Then the usual questions about being here before...I rolled over and we negotiated a nude HJ for $100. She looked great undressed and was doing such a good job, I wanted to slow things a little. I asked her nicely (YMMV of course) if she could climb up on the table. I was hoping she would straddle me in the 69 position but she was just off to the side so I couldn't try DATY. However, the sight of your gorgeous ass right in front of me got me over the line in no time. Zoe only works Thursdays so I'm really hoping to see her again soon to see what else could transpire! I think she may have been from Canada.

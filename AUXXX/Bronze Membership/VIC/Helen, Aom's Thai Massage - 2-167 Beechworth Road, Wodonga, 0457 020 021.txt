Services Provided : HJ,

Value for money/recommend? : Only if desperate, not sure there's much else in Albury Wodonga so at least it's a sure thing here.

My experience/comments : In the country for work I had some spare time but country towns are often difficult for RNT action.

Found this place online and rang and booked.

It's in some shops on a busy roundabout but there is a nice discreet car park out the back with its own entry.. Looked like I didn't need to book as it was fairly quiet this afternoon.

Negotiated $100 for 45mins including hj. Not cheap but seemed to be limited options in this town to me.

The ML was very ordinary looking maybe had some Maori, strong hands. Massage was average, not great not bad, quite firm. With no tease (never a good sign) I flipped over and she started jackhammering me before I was even at full mast. Never good, I slowed her down but her technique was poor for someone her age.  What saved this from being a total fail was her other hand drifted down to my backdoor and I encouraged her in. Was basically riding her finger which was very cool, until the end.

As I left I asked if she was Aom but she said no she is "Helen". They had a younger girl I saw there too so seemed to be a couple of options and 2-3 rooms.

If in Wodonga it may be worth a look but only to get a load off, I wouldn't specifically ask for Helen unless you want the anal play.

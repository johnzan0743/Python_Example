  Private house massage in Box hill and Mobile Massage in city  36

  I saw an ad on Locanto, "Private house massage in Box hill and Mobile Massage in city  36".

  Prices are as follows:
  30 minutes-$50
  45 minutes-$60
  60 minutes- $70

  Nancy works from a unit in Station Street, Box Hill



  An Asian lady (Nancy?) greeted me at the door.  She looked nothing like her photo on Locanto.  In fact, she looks 20 years older.  She can hardly speak English, but what the hell.



  Anyway, after taking me to a small room, she confirms that $70 buys a 1-hour massage.  The room was clean, and the heater was on.  The environment looked ok, but things went downhill quickly from there.



  The bottom line is that the massage was terrible:  rough and completely non- sensual.  I tried to encourage her to touch me in more sensitive areas, but she refused.



  On the flip, she sorted asked me what else I needed.  I asked her if she does relief, and she begrudgingly says she will do it for $50.  Like hell I was going to give her $50, so she settled on $30. 
  During the relief, she insisted on no toughing -not even her hip/waist.  Then she weakened and said that I could tough her waist/hip during the relief but that would cost $20.  Naturally, I refused.



  Guys if you are looking for nudity, sensual touching or anything more than a shite massage, then don't see Nancy.  An absolute rip off.



  In summary, she was worse than Cleo of Balwyn.



  I notice on Locanto that you can give a star rating.  I want to give her no stars and make a negative comment, but I don't know how.  If someone can let me know, or if someone wants to do it for me, then that would be appreciated.

Avoid.

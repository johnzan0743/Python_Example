My experience/comments : New shop opened up in Moonee Ponds this year near the train station. The place doesnt look impressive from the outside, but the inside is really well decorated and furnished. very clean and good vibes. seems like a wide variety of girls working there except for PRCs. shower was offered before and after which was a nice touch. neha's massage itself wasn't really too much to write home about, but if you are into alt girls, neha would be your pick. i paid $50 for a hj and she spent ages teasing me with her nails and the hj was not rushed at all. from memory she offers topless and nude as well, but too expensive. keen to go back and meet some other girls.

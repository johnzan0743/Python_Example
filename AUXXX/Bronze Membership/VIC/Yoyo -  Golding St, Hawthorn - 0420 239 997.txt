Person's Name :Olivia 

Establishment : private in Hawthorn

Date of Visit : March 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : http://m.locanto.com.au/melbourne/ID...You-Happy.html

Hours of Business : 10-8

Rates : 150 45 min 

Age : 28ish

Size/shape : plumpish

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage with body slide

Value for money/recommend? : good massage but not really worth it

My experience/comments : Saw ad on Locanto and pics looked good. Made booking and when I got to the place, I was told to wait 30 minutes. I had some time, so went to nearby cafe. Came back and was met by a plumpish girl in a too small for her dress. Should have gone but stayed anyway! Massage was good, she was a bit heavy for body slides...there was nothing sensual about getting squashed. On flip she did a very good and very oily, slow hand relief. She was fretted friendly and had decent English.  Don't know if more is on offer because I was not interested. I won't return there.

On locanto it says $80 for 60 mins. Are you including the cost of extras in your value per hour in your review?

All those shots of Asian girls are 100% bullshit.  Better to ask someone that has actually seen her.

Back in nov 2014 i reviewed a sweety named coco who i saw at 609 victoria st abbotsford. This shop is still running, and the mamasan opened 2 golding and 1136 whitehorse rd box hill. Her contact is 0406071666. I ran into her a few weeks back at the box hill address, and she asked me if i was the one who loved to see coco?. I told her "yes", and she told me she is back. She told me coco is working at 2 golding on tues and 1136 whitehorse rd on thurs. After trying both venues and missing coco, due to early arrivals, i started to wonder if the mamasan was just trying to lure me into falling for another one of her girls.

Today i tried golding st again, and arrived 30 mins after opening, and walked to the front steps, then saw coco, and walked past her in shock. You see when she left the business, i was pretty sad, but in a way relieved due to how sweet this girl is. Today i rang the bell and wanted to just pop up and say hi to this adorable girl, but in the end i decided to give her 30 mins of my time. Coco is now 21, and still sounds like a 5 year old girl, when she talks. I didnt need a massage today, but seeing her in a tight pink windcheater, short black skirt, and black pantyhose looking so adorable as she does, i just needed to catch up with her, as she did a hard massage.

Coco's eyes are doll like, but her hair looks a bit ratty, and she has small gaps between most of her teeth. She is the sweetest girl ive ever met in this industry, and i just couldnt do anything sexual with her again. She is still studying music at uni, she plays the piano, and I wouldnt mind punters checking her out, but once she starts talking, i couldnt imagine u could do naughty stuff with her. With 3 girls working here this tues, i knew she wouldnt be busy, and basically donated her money today. 

If anyone is interested in seeing coco, i will pm u the apartment numbers.

I had seen this place on Locanto and was looking to find  some new places apart from my usuals

The girl was attractive, nice body and nice tits.

She gave a good massage and started playing with my nuts and old fella while I was still lying on my stomach and did a good job of that.

Wanted $70 for a HJ...i thought that a was a bit expensive, offered her $50 but wanted $70. I don't like to bargain girls down and agreed.

Gave an enthusiastic HJ.


However, since visiting here I have discovered 621 High Street Reservoir and they give FS and CBJ for $100 for half an hour. It was my first visit to that place and the girl there was really attractive, so that place is going to be hard to beat!

Do you mean 621 High Street Thornbury or 621 Plenty Road Preston?
Not sure there is a 621 High Street Reservoir?

Yeah plenty rd is good. So is this place near the cop shop? 70 for a tug is a joke.

Next time when you go, ask for a 20minute massage for $30. Then your left over change of $20 will be the tug. (trust me, Always works at this place)

Paying $70 for a HJ is just setting a precedent for the rest of us.

My experience/comments :

This is the second visit to this place first visit no extra offered only a poor massage, never thought i would return but i was in the area and needed to kill some time before a meeting I popped in and was greeted by a very skinny older asain woman who took my money and showed me to the room she left then came back in about 30 seconds, I was still undressing she told me to make sure i take everything off. She was small and skinny with almost no tits no my usual type and wasn't sure if she would even get me over the line if extras were offered. I lay down on my stomach and i seen her get some oil and she went straight to town on the ass and balls there was virtually no massage just an hour of ass, ball and cock play which she was pretty good at and she allowed touching which helped as well. All in all was not a bad visit she ended with a good non rushed tug cleaned me up and i was on my way.

I am skeptical to return as i don't think all girls will provide extras in this place might be hit and miss

Reviews without the name of the provider or shop name and phone etc are not of much use. Unfortunately this is not your first such a one allan78.
Please take care when you visit to get all details and report them. That will make the review useful to members and be counted as a complying review.

My experience/comments:

So I just came back from an overseas trip and thought I'd goto my usual place where I've had some luck sometimes but lucked out the otheres.  I usually like a bit of surprise and i enjoy the chase, so I don't mind going to places that I don't have any guarantees.  Anyway, I've tried quite a few different people here but this time, I tried a new girl Kylie.  She'd only been working there for a week or so, and she speaks really good English.

I knew something was on offer when she came in, and ran her hand up my leg and was very friendly and all.  Most of the massage was pretty firm and good.  I told her that I normally get Sonia, but she was away in Thailand.

After a good 30-40 minutes, with very minimal tease, it was time for the flip over.  She slowly oiled me up and then she asked me if I wanted a massage "there".  At first I declined because she didn't get me very excited/aroused, but then I eventually changed my mind and she happily tugged me off.  Technique was ok, fairly mechanical, i think because she was new, she didn't quite feel comfortable yet.  Anyhow, I grabbed her legs/butt and finished off.

Another 5-10 mins of massage and hot towel and I was outta there after paying $30 extra.  Would I do it again? Mmmm, she was definitely nice to talk to, but left a little to desire on the aesthetics, but left with a good feeling, so yes.

I hear they are getting some newbies in there lately to generate some interest. Since Nicole left and took most of her regulars it was struggling a bit. A bit hit and miss , but can generally get a pretty decent Thai massage there if all else fails.

Yes, she is both running the shop and massaging regulars, extra's are still on the cards, but they aint cheap!  Naked HJ with touching she now wants $100+ massage price.  I declined. Better value out there!

No Chance at a reasonable price, unless your willing to give her stupid $$$$

[COLOR=#333333][COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments:

Decided to drop in during my Christmas break as I had read reviews here and I happen to be visiting a friend in the area.  I initially called to check that they were indeed open and I tried to suss out if they have anyone more curvy (I did say that I want someone not skinny who can do a firm massage!).  She said that Katie seems to fit the bill and that I would be happy with her so I booked an hour.

The actual place is set up quite nicely and the receptionist was a young girl who was very smiley and friendly.  I was led into a very comfortable looking room and got ready for Katie.  She enters and she is as the receptionist described...nice and curvy and quite busty for a Thai woman.  She's also fairly attractive with long hair and a great smile.  
She starts a very good massage, it's obvious that she's learnt to do it properly at some stage.  She is also quite chatty , but not over the top.  She asks me to flip around and start massaging my front.  She looks at my semi-erect state and asks if I would like a special extra as its my birthday (?!).  The receptionist had misunderstood when I had told her that I was in the area for a birthday to mean that it is MY birthday.  Who am I to correct her and said sure!  
She said that it was $50 and I asked her if she would go topless, give that its my birthday...so she agreed ;-)

She then got up and straddled me and started a really great HJ, nice and intense without rushing it.  At one point, I sat up and was able to get a good feel of her great tits.  Needless to say, there was no problem with her getting me over the line.

On the way out, she gave me a really big hug and kiss and wished me a great birthday!  She also said that she works at their new store (with the same name) in Nth Balwyn.[/COLOR][/COLOR]

No idea blueonion but you need to start posting reviews to maintain your free membership. Your last complying review https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f286/...44/#post129185 was in April 2014!

There are plenty of other providers around so you better get cracking to maintain your free membership.

Given your history of lack of reviews maybe you should take out paid membership like you had in 2013 which gives you access without the need to post your own complying reviews.

This shop was the first of what is now 3 shops run by the same woman. There is a sister shop in Balwyn on Burke rd just down from the Coles supermarket. The other is what was formerly known as contours in Whitehorse rd Balwyn.
Jasmine is the name of the manager / owner. Most of the woman offer a reasonable to very good Thai massage. She has a decent amount of girls working each day, but as with most shops the talent varies when it comes to looks and services provided. I would say 80 percent offer Thai massage and  Handjob. Generally $50 for the latter. There is also ladies who will offer significantly more with regulars. At Bulleen there is Tina & Paula who go the yard. I'll leave it up to you guys to find out more. With 3 shops Jasmine is really walking the line and could come under scrutiny now that they are issuing notices of " proscribed brothel " frequently. They are more discreet than most but watch this space.

Very annoying mate. The point of this forum is to help us all out so we don't have to find out more.

There's details of 3 massage shops that give good Thai massage and handjobs for $50. There is also more on offer for regulars. Nude, body slides . There are rumours that Tina goes further than this. I have not been her regular so can't confirm, however I can say that she is very popular and her regulars keep returning.

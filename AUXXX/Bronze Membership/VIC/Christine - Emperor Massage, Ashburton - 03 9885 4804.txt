Establishment : Emperor Massage

Date of Visit : November 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Level 1, 253 high street Ashburton VIC

Hours of Business : 10am-8pm, 7 days

Rates : $65/hr

Age : Late-30s/40

Size/shape : Short, overweight 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Rubbish massage, uninterested and poor HJ.

My experience/comments : went in up stairs to first floor. No one at desk but rang bell and older woman came down. Asked for an hour and she showed me to room then went upstairs, I'd hoped to get another girl but came in herself. Went in and out a couple of times to answer phone then came in and started. 
Naff massage, even compared to other RnT places where even though you both know why you're there would get a good rubdown first. largely going through the motions then flipped. Asked if I wanted extras, paid 30 for HJ. 
Don't think anything else was on offer but doubt i would have wanted it anyway. Got her tits out without asking and let me have a play for free but started moaning quite a lot which was a bit offputting. Happy just to finish and get out. 
Rubdown after with same towel, no hot towel which was a disappointing end to a mediocre experience.
Recommendation: avoid. Many better places to choose.

I visited this place yesterday, there is only 1 old lady who did the massage and it was crap. There was no offered extra. I just left with blue balls

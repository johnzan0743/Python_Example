My experience/comments : After work, I felt like I needed fresh air so I took a tram down to Docklands for a bit of a wander. Came past this place, got curious and walked in. There was two elder ladies there, the slimmer one offerred to take me.

Massage was pretty average nothing to write home about, but time for the flip, there was a bit of emphasis on the boys, after a while the tackle came to attention, was asked whether I wanted a handjob, I said how much and she showed two fingers ($20), the ML was pretty old and wasn't exactly a looker, but I thought what the hell, it was twenty bucks, so she lubed me up and it wasn't long before she finished the job. She then wiped me down and I was on my way.

My experience/comments : 
Was in the area for work so decided to drop in and see what was on offer. Two middle aged ladies were at hand - I initially asked if there was anyone younger. The more "senior" of the two said - "Try angela, she take good care of you".

Brought me upstairs. Told me to strip down and lie on the bed. Massage was meh, but she was friendly and tried to converse with her limited English. On flip, pointed to the little brother and asked if he wanted a massage for $20. I pointed to her chest and asked if she would do it with her top off. She obliged. Got down to business and relieved me efficiently. Wiped me down with a warm towel and left me to dress up.

Good experience. Not fantastic, but decent for the price.

I tried this place back in early aug this year.  There phone number has changed to 8395 2306. And also moved to number 1 not 10. Only got massage and her name was Michelle. However she did have someone walk in and wait in the chair near the curtain of room. I never asked for extra due to this.

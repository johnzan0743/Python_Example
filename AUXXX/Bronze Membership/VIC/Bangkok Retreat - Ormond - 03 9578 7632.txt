My experience/comments: This shop opened up about 12 months ago I think. I couldn'tfind any reviews so I thought I would start one off. I walked in without anappointment and was greeted by Jasmine, a nice conservative looking Thai girlwas glasses. Wearing short denim shorts and a white singlet top
The shop looksvery clean when u compare it to the normal Chinese shops 
Massage tablewas large comfy type. Jasmine returned and began a nice traditional Thaimassage where she will climb on top of you and use her knees before pulling outthe oil few the normal full body oil massage. - After the flip she massaged my legs and I asked about extras where therewas a few options available. Standard hand relief was $30, Topless HR $50 NakedHR $70.

Initially I just went for the standard HR, but after getting into it, I optedfor the topless upgrade J
Her techniquewas nice and after a few mins leaned over and started rubbing her breasts on mystomach which was nice. She then lifted her leg up over my head and moved intoa 69 position, at this point I was wishing I had taken the naked option J
Im pretty suremore would be on offer from this girl once she got to know you. She does seemto be the enterprising type
Jasmine worksThursday and Saturdays at Bangkok Retreat, and tells me she is also working atthe shop in Neerim Rd Murrumbeena, when she is not studying accounting atmonash J

 My experience/comments: After reading the review above, I thought I'd go and see for myself as it's local. Was also greeted by Jasmine who was wearing exactly the same - demin shorts and white singlet. Very cute girl. Asked for an hour which she said was fine. Sowed me into the room and asked me to undress and lay on the table as she went out for a few minutes. She returned and asked how I like the massage. Not to hard but not too soft. I asked her name to which she replied Jasmine so I knew I had the right girl. I straight away asked about extras and she told me she did HJ. I asked about naked and she whispered she did but others didn't so didn't want to say too loudly. I offered her $80 for everything she wold do and she quickly disrobed to reveal a vey sexy body - beautiful little boobs, shaven pussy, great arse. I asked if I could touch and she said fine. Hands her on her arse immediately. The massage could have been a little better but I wasn't complaining. Her hands were everywhere though which I loved and mine were allowed to roam wherever they wanted too. She turned me over and straight away started on the ol' boy. She was really good. Only took about 5 minutes to get me over the line. She cleaned me up, went to get hot towels and wiped the massage oil off. $$ were exchanged, I dressed and I was on my way after a quick kiss and hug. Looking forward to going back for perhaps a harder massage but the same extra service I expect - maybe more is on offer for regulars. Apparently others there don't do naked, so don't ask. She's a nice girl too. Likes to chat and really friendly.

Person's Name : Miki - then switch-a-roo after 5min to Mary

Establishment :BangkokRetreat

Date of Visit : 15/05/15

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 537 North Road, Ormond VIC 3204
(03) 9578 7632 http://www.bangkokretreat.com

Hours of Business : 10:00am to 9:00pm

Rates : $70 for 1 hour

Age : Early 30's

Size/shape : 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Remedial massage

Value for money/recommend? : Nope

My experience/comments: 

So based on the other reviews I thought I'd head down there and TOFTT on a different day (I wish I hadn't now). Walked in there and was greeted by the receptionist who showed me through the back (through the kitchen) to a double massage room. In came Miki a fairly decent looking girl who was quite chatty and seemed friendly. She did drape a towel loosely over me but it certainly wasn't getting in the way. Then without warning about 5 min in she leaves the room and in comes her replacement Mary.

Mary is less chatty and is more focused on the massage. She also does more of a remedial massage that kind of hurt, like I was at the physio. I do have to say though she was good at massage and worked out all the knots in my back. She made no attempts at brushing the region and by this stage (totally covered by the towel) I had all but given up.

On the flip, I was once again fully covered by the towel and she proceeded to work on my legs and arms. Thought, what the hell and popped the question, to which I was given a firm NO. I lied and said I had received more last time and she asked who I saw. I replied that I didn't want to get them in trouble. She says to me "I don't need more money", and I asked if she was rich, more out of annoyance than anything else. She said she was a friend of the manager and it was her first day. Great...just my luck.

WIR: Maybe on a Thursday.

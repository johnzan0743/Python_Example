My experience/comments :Found a wechat contact last Friday night with the address and mobile phone number to a massage shop in Monee Ponds last week

I made a phone call and and the girl said just come, 3 young girls available and we close at 10:00pm. 

Was  very disappointed on my arrival when only an mature lady greeted me  when she's in another section with another guy, she's totally naked but  she's not the right one as I'm not after mature lady at all that day.  However I told myself this could be a good sign as this shop might  provide much more than a normal massage. 

Waited for 15' in the  wait room, even heard that mature lady came out and rinsed her mouth in  the toilet !!?? Oh wow she must be providing BBBJ then, I think 

Then  came Vicky, a much younger and much more attractive girl taking me to  her room. She said she comes from Japan and she speaks very well  English. I was offered $70 for 45' with HJ only??? Very down on my mood  already but for the look of Vicky I'd give a try, with the hope of  touching her nice boobs and ass during the section. 

She then starts giving a pretty average massage, just a lot of rubbing really but no real complaints. However I  was falling to the ground from the cloud again when after the first 20m  she said another $50 needed for a HJ on the flip ?? WTF, with $120 I'd rather go the  number 100 for nude body slide,CBJ and sexy Caucasian girls so I said no  immediately. So at the end it's money down the drain, $70 for a very  normal 45' massage (not even 45m and not even a decent massage!!!)

WIR:  Definitely no. This shop can be easily found on Locanto as well with a  mobile phone provided. I think this phone number belongs to the mature  lady I met.

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments :Haven't been to this place for a long time and will probably be the last time that I do.  

Suki was the only girl available when I went in on the afternoon and Was a bit disappointed with that, but I was there and needed some relaxing so decided to still go ahead with the massage.

Well i should have trusted my instincts cos the massage was terrible, no real substance to her massage technique just random hand movements up and down, luckily I only went for the 30 min option.  

On the flip she asked if I wanted extra and told me it was $20 for HJ, $50 for nude HJ and then $80 if I wanted a BJ. I only went for th HJ option as I just wanted the relief and to get out of there.  I think there could be FS available to if I had asked.

Overall a very disappointing experience, considering there are meant to be much better options available nearby. 

WIR: No.

Davide thanks for reviewing again, pity that it was not very good, better luck next time. Better to always follow your instincts I think.

On recommendation from Bill decided to try. Made a booking but had to wait about 15 mins for Emily to finish eating :0(

A bit of confusion with mamasan about the duration and not sure if I settled on 45 or 60 mins. Wasn't too worried though, when introduced to Emily I knew it would be good. She's a Viet but with blonde hair, quite attractive.

Had a room at the front half of the shop with Â¾ height walls, wasn't lucky enough to have the fully enclosed rooms at the back of the shop.

Great massage, she wears a skirt so she can back massage with he knees/legs. She knew what I wanted when massaging my arse, as I spread legs so she could access my balls which she proceeded to oil up. Turned over, she grabbed my hand and put it on her arse, I lifted the skirt and had a good feel around. Only the pussy is off limits but she doesn't mind gentle touching elsewhere.

$20 for the hj and well worth it. I'll go back again. She says she works 7 days at the establishment.

Glad to see that Emily delivered for you. You were right to get her to start while you are face down. That way you can get a slow build-up over 30 mins, with enough access to her cute arse and nips to project you well over the top. She is a sweetie and certainly gives way more than $20 value for extras!!!

Sad to report. Young Emily is no longer working. The mamasan reported that she has just got married - to an Aussie customer - lucky boy.

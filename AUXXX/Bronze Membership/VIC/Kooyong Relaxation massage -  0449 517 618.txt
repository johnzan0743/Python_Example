Value for money/recommend? : yes shes lovly 

My experience/comments : I was watching this place when i am walking by from work, decided to call one day, she sound very 
polite and innocent so booked in for 1 hour. It a massage room set up back in a pharmacy, can enter from back as well without 
meeting the people in front i didn't know as it was my first time. 
In to the room she was wearing a skirt and i love that as it is easy accesses, asked me undress and i am on the table. 
place looks lovely but bit professional as well so i was bit of loosing hope. 
however the massage was amazing she knew what she was doing and half way in asked to be turned
and she made this wild look on my fella and i was bit surprised at this stage because up till now she 
was all professional. 

however after bit of a chat, i found out that she is a professional massage girl but she quit from the 
last job and now she is doing her own thing and like to make more money. i didnt discuss the extras
 hand her $30 and closed my eyes, it was an amazing Hj, she definitely had the skills and the touch, 
to make it better she was nervous and it was genuine and i loved it. 
my hand was busy and end up in her skirt and she spread the legs inviting me in to feel her. with 
that move i was easily over the gate and she squeezed out every bit out and cleaned me like 
a professional. 

i gave her another 20 she was over the moon and it was so worth it and she begged me to return 
and i definitely would. 

few things i learned she is not there full time, she is only coming there when she gotta client and 
she said she can do more for cheap if she got more clients in the same day and she is free towards
the weekend more. please do not offer her more unless you getting something as you can make 
her happy with a little.

Size/shape : small chubby build

Nationality or Ethnicity :  Malaysian 

Services Provided : Sensual massage, HJ, 

Value for money/recommend? : no not really

My experience/comments : 

so after reading reviews on her i decided to give her a try. she works in kooyong mondays and tuesdays but mitchams the other days, kooyong is her new establishment.

the massage shop front is like all other shop fronts  "healthly asian massage blah blah blah" the reason i prefer going to independent masseuse is to not be caught out by people watching me walk in/out. walk of shame? 

when i walked in i see lyn an ok to plumpish girl, no sex appeal at all. i would rate her 4/10. but thats ok b/c i was looking forward to the actual massage. 

i asked for an hr but she could only give me 45. i told her no probs.

i laid down on the table and got one of the worst massages, very weak to no effort at all. all she did was glide her hands across my back and legs as if she was painting and soft squeeze here and there. at this stage i was put off and when she asked me if i wanted extras i declined.

shes a nice girl, but i wont be back.

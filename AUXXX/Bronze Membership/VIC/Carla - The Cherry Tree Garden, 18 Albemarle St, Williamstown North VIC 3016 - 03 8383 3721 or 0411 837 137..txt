My experience/comments : 

I have been meaning to visit The Cherry Tree Garden due to hearing how classy the place looks but unfortunately for them they seem to lack girls. I pop in one night and am greeted by 3 girls, a rather small number. I decide to go for Carla because of her thicc ass. After payment, she grabs me by the hand and leads me to the room. 

Unfortunately she does not know much english. After the shower I am met with the usual catbath and teasing of the shaft. She says extra for no condom. Unfortunately for me, my pockets are not very deep. 

She gives a decent CBJ and we go into CG, then missionary. What surprised me here is how I've been wanting to do a WL from behind while she is lying down, not quite doggy. Seen it in JAV and been on my mind for a while. Well, she turns around and offers it and me with my excitation couldn't control myself and the deed is done.

We talk a bit with a translator app and when the time is up she turns off the timer and says she doesn't want to go yet. Not sure if genuine but cute. Unfortunately, we had to go and I head off to shower and leave.

The Cherry Tree Garden is as the rumours say. The waiting room is classy, the rooms are classy but there are not a lot of girls.. Hopefully that improves.

My experience/comments : Was passing this area for the first time in a couple of years. Seems quite a few shops have opened up along the same strip of shops. Went to the oldest of them (upstairs) and it's a standard cheaply run AMP. $65 per hour, $30 extras for the tug.

It was a cold expeirience on two fronts - no conversation due to limited English, plus the room could have been a lot warmer. Minimal oil with a half hearted effort with the massage. On the turn, was offered a clothed HJ for 30, nothing else on offer. I just didn't gel with the experience, and in the end had trouble getting over the line, so had to take over myself. I think the workers name was Angie.

I know these places are cheaper, but I'd rather pay more for a better expeirence. The cool mints I was offered on the way out were the highlight.

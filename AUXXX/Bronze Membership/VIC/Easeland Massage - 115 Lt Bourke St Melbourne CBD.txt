My experience/comments : Deciding to visit a massage parlour today, have only been to a couple before but been walking past this one in Chinatown and wanted to try it, saw it was open and bright neon light so I walk up the stairs, mamasan behind desk says you want massage? And how long you want? So I pay for half an hour, get ushered into room and told to undress. Then I undress and wait on the table and 5 minutes later, a much younger girl walks in and smiles, she says her name is Cherry and she instructs me to lie down and we begin the massage. Her technique was very average, just light rubbing of my back bum and thighs but kept dancing finger around my butt hole, then after a short time she tells me to turn around and asks if I want handjob, I say yes ands he says handjob 50 extra, so I pay and she puts some oil on her hand and starts to jerk me off, her technique for this was very good, it was not long before I finally came and she cleaned me up. After we hugged and she told me next time she would do something special for me, I don't know if it's true, but I will come back to see her again.

I remember there is or was a karaoke and pool hall down a lane off Lt bourke, an upstairs venue,u had to catch a lift upstairs, this is going back 25 odd years, remember lots of hot Asian girls and thought, wouldn't it be great if there was a brothel in China town.  I suppose this Rnt is as close to one as u can get . Getting a handy from a girl dressed in more than the skimpy Asian chicks i remember at this karaoke and pool venue.

There's a karaoke (bass lounge I think) in the shopping centre a few doors up from this place, one night I saw a young girl (18-25) outside smoking and had a chat with her, she said she was a hostess there, very pretty wearing heels, I think I saw a pool hall down the street too, but inside that shopping centre (Paramount retail centre) there are at least 3 more massage parlours, 2 on the 2nd floor, 1 on the top floor, all girls rotate between them and seem to be managed by the same mamasan. A news article said karaoke bars and beauty salons in Chinatown can be fronts for illegal brothels, and there is a beauty salon across from this massage place, so I wondered if there was anything going on in there. I will probably return to the area again soon to see what I can find out, I'm sure there is something more on offer in one of these places

Just to confirm, "Services Provided" states "Topless Hj" but you don't mention it in your dialogue. Was she topless?

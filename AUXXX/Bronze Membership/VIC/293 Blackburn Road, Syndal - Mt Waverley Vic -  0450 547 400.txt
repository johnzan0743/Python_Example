I actually posted a review for this place a couple of weeks ago.... There was originally a reference to it that indicated that it was tied in with a place that was closed in East Bentleigh. I took a visit and from what I was told there was no relationship with the East Bentleigh Place.

The place does look legit, especially with the sign that is out the front facing the road.

I can't recall the names of the girls I saw, Susy must be a new one, and it doesn't sound as though you had much luck with her.

I had booked for an hour, had 50/50 with two girls due to the girl I originally had being booked. Both girls I had provided good massages, spoke reasonable English. The second girl (name in the review I posted, but I can't seem to find it with the new rules) used to work at a place in Surrey Hills.

From my experience there I'd say the place is worth a second try, I'd be sure there was a lot more on offer there. I think from memory it was around 70 for the hour (hj included), when asked about the cost of extras, the girl said it was up to me. I was a bit pushed for time so I didn't take it any further than the HJ but I'll be back soon for another try... I'll post a review then

Another fine review Wol, just wondering if those hours of business are correct. If so makes it a bit difficult to attend Monday through Friday. Never thought of using the the stop watch feature on the iPhone...some of these establishments do tend to short change the time by 5 mins or so. Lol !!!

An answer for both of you. The shops hours are 10 till 8 most likely 7 days a week. Contact number 0450547400. I don't use the stop watch function on the phone as I do not take it with me. I just use my watch which has a stop watch feature. I actually don't know Yoyo (yuyu?) I was given her name as "the key to the door" for additional pleasantries. It worked. She is working this week on Thurs and Fri. If you attend please give us a report. Good punting.

Not too difficult to get the extra services, HJ and was prepared to FS for the right fee. Bit bushy for my liking and as usual difficult to understand some requests.  Not sure if that is to make it more difficult to negotiate.   A good HJ completion but next time I would skip the nude fee

visit this parlour on Sunday, two ladies working  both available one is fairly old, so choose the young one, not bad looking for first impression. got into room, clean enough, talk to her to get fully naked with HJ for 50 bucks, but no touch under, a bit expensive i would say, the massage is really bad when i turn over her directly goes to my penis, HJ is not bad but i guess i just not in the mood or something, she gives me a feel that she's been is industry for really long time, and not in a good way anyway blow up in 5 mins and say goodbye, may not return

I think lads this may also be a natural attrition for AMP's due to the astonishing rate of openings over the past 12 months in the Eastern and South Eastern suburbs. Two owners to whom I have become acquainted have mentioned recently that business is at an all time low due to the over abundance of shops in the area. Suppose it may end being the survival of the smartest operators and will in time be for the benefit of the punter. Though as we all know competition is good.

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)
Was feeing toey so took a late night stroll through the area to find the dodgiest amp I could find that was open & this was it. Went downstairs & asked for 1/2 hour. Smiling ml took me into the massage room so I could get ready. Stripped & lay face down, she took a few minutes to come back coz 2 punters walked in. She woke up another ml to attend to one & told the other to come back.
lisa came back & was friendly enough, started a very ordinary massage, basically just shaking my body. I told her softer 3 times before she finally stopped shaking me & started rubbing. After a little while she said turn over so I said what the hell, it can't get any worse. Once turned over she started playing with my limp dick asking if I want hj for $50. I said $30, she offered $50 with by. I countered with $50 nude by but she said no so I took the hj for $30. Good hands with crack action, my hands wandered over clothes & snuck under her top to play with her saggy b's. Finished soon enough & was gone before the buzzer. 
She was friendly enough but typical in & out type amp, won't return, plenty of others to try.

My experience/comments : Booked in for a 1 hour ($70) massage with Kiki today, first time I've gone to Lavender Massage here in Perth. Massage was really good, quite hard how I like it. Eventually got to the tease and tickle and before too long she asked me to flip; asked me what I wanted. I asked for nude BJ ($100 extra), she took off her gear and got into it with a bit of a cat bath with lots of ball licking, then she chucked on a dom. I asked her if she does bj without the dom, she said she did but for more money. Nearly offered $150 but at the last second said $120 which she accepted so she took the dom off and started enthusiastically sucking my cock and licking my balls. Then, without prompting she chucked my legs over my shoulders and began some light rimming. Felt amazing. Wasn't too long after that the deed was over (CIM), I paid the money and left. Will definitely return, for $190 and an hour's massage massage you'd be lucky to get CBJ let alone BBBJ, CIM and some rimming. Awesome.

Sounds like a great time mate, how'd you pick the girl, did you just show up and choose or was there an ad with their pics?

Odm, The best way to clarify that would be to book a session and find out.

 Insurance and RnT, the mythical unicorn?
				
Post Content: 
Hi guys, so I have got health insurance, which I'd obviously like to claim. I get about $400 claimable a year for natural therapies which includes massages, more towards the remedial side of things.

Maybe I am seeking out a non-existent unicorn or I don't know where to look...

But has anyone heard of a place where I can swipe my health insurance card and claim some of the payment, while also receiving the glorious tug??

Am I a dreamer?

There are a few massage places (mainly Asian ones) where you can get the health fund rebate for a rub'n'tug session. Where do you live? Quite a few around Chatswood used to do this, although there are fewer than used to be since a bit of a crack-down.

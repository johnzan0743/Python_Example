 Website for escorts with punter information / warnings / comments
				
Post Content: 
Hi all

I just went to book with someone to be told my number has come up in a "search" which says I have stolen money of an escort.... 

I've never stolen anything in my life let alone from a escort. The person who stated it said all reports were anonymous and didn't tell me where they saw this rubbish. Googling my own number brings up nothing and I've tried to see if there is any website that would hold such information but no luck.... 

Has anyone had a similar experience? Or know where such rubbish gets posted?

If you use a phone number just for punting then theres really no need to worry. Just change number.

If you use your primary, everyday phone for punting also then you are asking for trouble. 

Whilst I doubt (but its not impossible)  there is a an exclusive website for escorts to check on "dodgy" punters, if you are using your primary number then she has most probably looked you up and decided she doesn't want to see you. 
Whilst you have googled your own number, try searching Facebook by the same number. 

There are Twitter accounts called "Shit Punters" etc where WL's post SMS messages (mainly) and tweets of punters who lack "tact" to put it politely.

No website I'm aware of, but l know a few escorts who are 'career' long workers, as in they have done it for +5 years and have built a good client base. They advertise on Scarlet Blue primarily. They have told me they share around a large database which contains punters numbers. Don't know how detailed it is nor if it only shows dodgy punters!

I believe there is an online 'punter blacklist' of sorts where WLs record names/numbers of undesirable clients, whether for safety or financial reasons. Can't recall what it's called though, it was discussed on another forum some years ago. Of course, as well-intentioned it may be, probably no recourse to get your number off the list if added accidentally (eg by transposing digits) or maliciously.

Some girls do post warnings on their own websites and also on Twitter. You can really see a girls true personality reading her tweets! I think there maybe an ugly mug website, or list also.

Well, we write anonymous reviews on them so why shouldn't WLs share intel amongst themselves.

In fact they have a better reason for doing so - we use reviews to find good service, they share the info to protect each other.

But there should be some way of correcting the situation if an individual is erroneously blacklisted - but it wouldn't be easy.

I'd like to think something like the "Report an Ugly Mug" forum would increase the level of respect shown to WLs by deterring the punters who treat them badly but I fear such a forum will have no affect on the idiots who don't do the right thing.

had a girl I was considering booking ask for a 'reference' and imply she would be checking up, I can see why there exists such a resource but it proves to be hard to verify yourself when you primarily punt in brothels under a fake booking name...

The problem with this list is if they accuse a punter for being an ugly mug because they show up late, or some other menial thing. It works both ways. I have heard plenty of stories of escorts taking money for bookings, then not answering calls, showing up late, or not showing at all. I don't book escorts for this reason. One time I had a booking with an amateur escort and when I got there she wouldn't answer her phone. Seen her once before and it was great. She did apologise later saying she was sick. Ok why not text me before? The only problem for me was the time wasted driving there and back. Two hours!

Ugly mugs are taken very seriously - punters don't get reported for showing up a bit late.

There was a link to a website posted on here earlier this year that sounds like its the one mentioned by LV....I think was posted by a pissed off WL. We removed it as it contained a lot of personal info of punters who had been added to the site. Real names, aliases, addresses, marital status, multiple phone numbers etc....

It wasnt reviews of punters performances as such - it was posted warning WL's of possible dangers associated with booking these individuals.

All sorts of  stuff was included like if they were violent, unclean, fetishes, non payers, thieves  etc....

There are numerous ways to report and view Ugly Mugs, and a few different screening methods. No good sex worker will tell you this information and, frankly, I would be wary of one if they did. 

You know how you guys are always saying to NEVER talk about the forum to workers? It's exactly the same but with the increased risk of rape and violence. I 100% agree that it works both ways, and that is why I (unlike most girls in the industry!) think that review sites are very important. But you do have to understand that, while there is the potential you guys will get assaulted (by her boyfriend or something I guess), sex workers are getting assaulted every single day. And I've read your reviews - I know you can get ripped off too. So please don't be offended or outraged that we talk, as you do. It is so that we can continue working and providing the best possible service. I took two years away from the industry because I was raped by a client. It is in my and your best interest for me to screen. 

The reports are not black and white - it's not 'this guy stole money' and then no one ever sees him again. Just like punter's review sites there are different opinions. Often someone will come along and say 'wow I've been seeing him for years and had no issues', or multiple workers will say they had the exact same experience. So just like this forum the girls can use that information to make the decision on whether they are comfortable seeing that person. Often they will still see the person but be on guard given the information they have received. 

Of course, like punters, there are workers who are bad apples. IF OP genuinely hasn't ever stolen something I can only imagine a worker was angry at him for some reason, wanted revenge, or was just a nutter. And that is a real shame - but it works similar to these forums - we know the workers who can't really be trusted or who get upset at the tiniest little thing and we take what they say with a grain of salt. The other option is she didn't want to see you for some other reason and used that as an excuse?

Thanks to all for comment and input. Yes phone is a burner just annoying have to change it all over... But oh well first world problems! Shall see what happens if any other WL raise the issue. The problem is more so when you contact a new one if you don't hear back you don't know if it is because of my number being on mysterious database!

'Ugly mugs' is just the general term used to describe dangerous punters.

Many moons ago in the early 2000s a wl in an establishment insisted I go get myself checked out by a doctor even though no other wl in other establishments had any issues with their health check. 

So cut a long story short being young and dumb I went to the trouble of going to a sex clinic for tests. But to get a written statement that I actually had clean results I had to tell the clinic staff I was going to start as a male sex worker. 

I was given a booklet to help newbie sex workers. There was a list of ugly mugs in there. Although I assume these days it has moved to electronic format for easy search and comments. 

On a side note the other interesting thing I discovered in this handout was that when a wl suggests a position change the general use that as an excuse to check your Condom is still on and hasn't broken. 

Now when a wl suggests a position change and I see them looking at the condom as a joke I ask them has it broken yet?

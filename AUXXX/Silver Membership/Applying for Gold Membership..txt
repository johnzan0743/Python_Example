 Applying for Gold Membership.
				
Post Content: 
Silver members who have, or are considering applying for Gold, please be aware that it takes time for your applications to be processed. 

It is not a case of reaching your 24 Template reviews, apply for Gold and be upgraded that day. 

There is quite a bit of research to be done on each applicant, and there are limited inductions available. 

This means that even though we may feel you are suitable for Gold, you still may have to wait to be upgraded. 

TIP: Be patient. Bombarding Moderators with PM's will not help speed up the process.

Some info on what we are looking for which may help you to decide if Gold is for you.

Gold membership has to be earned. We are looking for members who are committed punters who regularly post informative and reliable reviews.

You will need to have demonstrated  commitment to the Forum in terms of membership longevity, obeying our rules, consistently posting template reviews, agree with our Rules and with how the Forum is run, and generally demonstrating good character, 

We will need to feel you are trustworthy. The information and reviews contained in Gold must stay in Gold.

If you feel you meet our criteria, and wish to be considered for Gold membership, you may apply to our Site Administrator  andrewblake via PM and state your case.

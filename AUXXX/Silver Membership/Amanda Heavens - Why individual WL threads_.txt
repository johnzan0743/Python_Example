 Amanda Heavens - Why individual WL threads?
				
Post Content: 
Ok this is probably the wrong place to ask, but why do most establishments have a sub-thread with all their reviews, but then some like AH, have all their reviews littered about the place? Could we tidy those up so the order is consistent? (ie Location->Establishment->Reviews of girls)

This was due to the fact when they ceased to be an advertiser there threads were enormous and we had to "dismantle" and rename them individually.. Now we have to go back and reassemble it into one thread.. 

We know this and it is a lot of work but it takes time.. So just be patient..

Given the sheer number of reviews that get posted for this place I think it's going to make it a lot harder for us punters to research a particular AH girl in these forums after this change. Yes I know we can use the search facility, but given that each girl often has 10, 20 or even 30 responses in their thread it's almost certain to reduce the usefulness of the forum as a knowledge base, especially if we're sitting in the intro room doing a search on the girls we just met in fucklotto and have 2 minutes to make a decision.

We've got 98 pages of reviews to wade through in 2 threads. It really won't make it easier. Sure there are commercial considerations but in this case I wonder if the forum users will be more inconvenienced as a result of this change than the establishment.

Just sayin', as a consumer...

Ok..

Phil and those who AH is a favoured establishment..

Ill address your concerns away from the actual thread.. And placed in Silver..

Thank you for your concerns and comments and it is noted..

Yes, quite possible it has made things abit more difficult for you but it is no different to the other establishments..

Yes, Due to the large size the thread itself was split into 2 and even then it is huge..

As mentioned before.. it was done as AH ceased to be an advertiser.. and there were other complicated matters involved.. and at that point in time we did not know how to go about "dismantling" the forum/space which they occupied.. 

Having/retaining a sub forum as a stop gap was one way to do it.. but other "advertisers" questioned the validity of it when they had to pay and AH did not.. and they still got a "sub" forum at no cost and there own area.. 

Hence Admin spent many nights renaming the girls threads individually and then they were "released" back into the north shore forum.. and it blew out to 9 pages long solely due to AH.. 

From a "research" point of view it was "perfect" as each girl had there separate thread.. but as FZN mentioned.. it kinda "polluted" the forum space and looked untidy.. which in opinion.. YES..

So realistically there is no right solution for it.. 

It is unfortunate.. but you will see that probably half the girls reviewed may no longer be there.. 

It maybe of a slight inconvenience.. but to keep everything "simple" and clean.. this is the only way we can go about it..

You will find that AH has the biggest thread overall.. They were with us since the beginning.. We helped them and they helped us in establishing the "forum" review age.. 

So.. We understand your point of view.. but.. guess it makes it more viable to "research" before hand or chase the thrill of punt lotto at the same time and then go back and see if there are any reviews and then write a "new" review.. reverse psychology!.. 

Time will tell if what we have done is right or wrong.. 

AB

The other aspect is that as reviews gather age, they become less relevant. WLs change their service over time... they may leave for a while then come back. Names get recycled and at times it can be a chore to know whether you're actually seeing the lady you thought you were. Another example is 533... there are archived reviews going back to before the place was affiliated. But does anyone seriously want to trawl back that far to read them? I know if I'm looking for intel on a particular WL or ML then anything more than a few pages starts to become irrelevant.

What pisses me more is the number of punters who are obviously reading the latest reviews and presumably using them to choose a provider but never write their own reviews. When you think about it, there's a relatively small band of reviewers in a membership base of nearly 35,000 and 4,200 'active' members. Probably numbers in the mere hundred or two. This applies to AH as much as anywhere else. But hey, that's social media on the internet for you!

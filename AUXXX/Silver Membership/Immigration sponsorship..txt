I get talking with my regular and ask who the guy is that picks her up after work?.....husband? , boyfriend?, relative?
She says no...he's my sponsor....he allows me to stay in Australia?.....he then goes on to tell me how she has to stay with him for another twelve months even though he controls her every move, goes through her purse after she comes home and makes her pay for everything?
She says she has to do this to keep her visa?
Can anyone explain how this setup works?....

I'd be a little more circumspect, if I were you. These sorts of arrangements are common. And there is a spectrum within, from - as some say "slavery" which is obviously odious and ought to be acted upon - through to the complete opposite, in which the sponsored is the one being taken advantage of.

In view of this quote from the girl:

... no circumspection required IMO. If she feels like she's "in prison" then she is being controlled... physically and financially. This is illegal and should be reported. No ifs, buts or circumspection. If the end result is that she has to return home then so be it. 

Not sure where the idea of "spectrum of slavery" comes from. Here is the legalese from THIS website:



			
				Section 270.1 of the Criminal Code defines the term 'slavery' as

the condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised, including where such a condition results from a debt or contract made by the person.
			
		

 The other condition is servitude, defined here:




			
				Section 270.4(1) defines 'servitude' as:

the condition of a person (the victim ) who provides labour or services, if, because of the use of coercion, threat or deception: 

(a)  a reasonable person in the position of the victim would not consider himself or herself to be free: 

(i)  to cease providing the labour or services; or 

(ii)  to leave the place or area where the victim provides the labour or services; and 

(b)  the victim is significantly deprived of personal freedom in respect of aspects of his or her life other than the provision of the labour or services.
			
		

 and also punishable with long terms of detention.

Pretty clear to me... plenty more reading for those interested. And without reading pages of the act, it would not surprise me to find that a failure to report clear knowledge of such a condition could also be punishable.

This is the sort of thing that threatens the whole sex industry and media reports of this are frequently used to support things such as an intro of the "Swedish Solution" etc.

Report it... or at least take steps to stop it if the girl is emotionally close.

The owner of this forum has mentioned the posting of illegality in the industry before. Not a trifling matter. Whether or not this particular situation falls in to such categories remains to be seen.

No, I didn't say "spectrum of slavery." That's verballing me and offensive. 
My point was that there is always two sides to every story. I know of women in exactly the circumstance described above - they are sponsored - and there is no way they are being exploited. In fact, in one case, it's my opinion that she is exploiting the poor bastard who forked out the money. I'm just offering an opinion.

Guys.....I really appreciate your input here.....thats why I posted up this.
sillyoldwanker.....I can understand what your getting at mate.....when I started seeing her, she was quite guarded about her life and didn't offer much in the way of personal info.....however, I've been seeing her for a few months now and after getting to know her better she even showed me photos of her "sponsor"....
Glad she did because I've seen him lurking around outside her workplace on a few occasions (she had said before that he follows her around)....
Anyways....I'm sure  theres more to this than meets the eye.....will talk more to her tomorrow and see if I can find out more...

Some people will pay 10s of thousands of dollars to stay here. They will have to stay together for more than 12 months! Fake relationships and marriages are part of the parcel. 

I don't know who would be exploiting who in this case. It wouldn't be an easy task for either party involved.

I have been asked many times over the years to marry for a PR and the one time I did help someone it wasted many years of my life. It's worse if there is no money involved and they get pregnant to try and latch onto you.

That depends on his assets and what he had to loose. After two years and a baby she could make a claim over his assets. If he is a smart cookie he has none. Girls like this can be very nice when they want something. You don't know what she says to her sponsor man.

She is waiting for the time when she will be a "free woman"....so she puts it?
She says he is "not a very nice man" and he yells and threatens her with sending her back to China.....
When I asked if he is ever violent towards her she said no, he has never hit her, but from what I see, he is emotionally and verbally abusive towards her.....he also tells he she "must" have sex with him.....

Assuming everything hotwheels posts here is true - as this girl is spelling it out to him - then the situation is seriously murky. It's no excuse to imply that this situation may be common and that the boot can be on the other foot. That may or may not be true. Frankly, there seems to be a lot of such dubious hearsay in the twittersphere used by those who would outlaw prostitution and introduce a range of draconian legislation.

In terms of the letter of the law, this particular situation is coercive and could readily be found by a court to be in breach of Section 270. A read of the mentioned webpage clearly indicates that while there is the exercise of control over an individual's freedom and behaviours - including an insistence that this woman fall pregnant to the sponsor FFS - then how anyone can argue otherwise is beyond me. Further, the emotional and verbal abuse as described in the last post could well be in breach of DV laws. That this woman is tentative in expressing a need to escape the situation is further evidence of the extreme duress she is under. Equally, the notion of waiting until she is a free woman. This sponsor may well turn out to be the type to enforce his will to the limit... the whole situation has all the hallmarks of DV with possible tragic consequences.

Hey hotwheels. Found myself in a similar scenario to yourself a few years back with a girl who's trust I had tried hard to gain over many years. It is a very troubling dilemma as I am sure you know - I wrestled with my conscience for months. In the end I chose to do nothing about her situation. There were many reasons for this choice, though primarily it was because she did not want the authorities involved in her situation and that there would be "repercussions" not only for her, but also her family back home. Further complicating any decision was the fluidity of the truth with this girl and her academy award worthy acting capabilities...

That said, there sounds a more tangible distress and/or immediate threat to the lady in what you've described than was the case with me and which made my inaction ultimately palatable to my conscience. FWIW, also bear in mind the case of Abraham Papo.

To end this fable on a higher note, the girl who i wrote about is now "free" and working towards her PR in Australia

Behind an arranged immigration set up like this could well be a syndicate.

Girls giving money back, offering to pay and giving you a sob story is part of the parcel to hook you in. 

First they offer this and that, next they want money back and your house. She is most likely using the other guy to stay here and looking for her next victim, I mean saviour. It's easy to fall for these girls. ML are no different to WLs really. 

I know girls who make thousands of dollars a week who still cry poor. But think nothing when they blow a few hundred at the pokies, or casino.

There maybe a reason why the guy she is with yells and threatens her. I don't think you know the full story. She may tell him she needs to work to support her family and she will quit her job. You don't know what's going on, apart from what she tells you. Why would he bother to help her?

Yes she could be playing you, however it is at least equally likely that she just likes you and doesn't want to lose face by you paying for her all the time. The tip thing was probably her way of saying thank you and making sure the tip was not a mistake- did she ultimately accept the tip? Even if she did she was still paying you some respect in return.

The fact there is a sponsor rather than a 'husband' involved seems to imply something to do with a work sponsored visa going on. If so the arrangement is likely to be dodgy as most of those visas the sponsor has to show the person on the visa has skills that they can't get onshore. I've heard of rorts in the press and can only speculate on what those might be, but if this is the arrangement it does leave the visa holder open to coercion as the sponsor can threaten to withdraw the sponsorship. Shame but I'm sure it happens.

Now the other situation- the arranged marriage, that I know a bit more about. Apparently there are various combinations of arrangements depending on whether the potential citizen pays money, how much money, does housework or other things  But that's another story.

I agree with slarty. I'll bet there is not a legal sponsorship arrangement. Most likely to be a dodgy arrangement set up by this sponsor or a syndicate. If a syndicate, then this sponsor is probably also being played. As I said at the outset, this is illegal from more than one perspective... indeed, even if the girl is playing hotwheels then this amounts to a form of extortion. But I don't agree with the sceptics here. My take is that the girl is shit-scared but feels powerless to change the situation... and as already mentioned may well to be reluctant to try to change the situation for fear of deportation.

"Slavery" or "Servitude"? Read the rules and take your pick.

Not sure about Asian ML/WL, but eastern European ladies coming to Oz bring interesting books  with them -Divorce/Family Law in Australia etc. in their native language. It is working very simple - find unsophisticated, simple mind, unsure man on the internet or while on study here and marry him.
After that no sex, provoke him to make noises  - police called and AVO issued. After that most provided with refuge. And BAM with this application for PR
easily approved ( pity a "victim" of domestic violence ). If the pure thing got some asset, they will get share of it . Life is good...

With Asian girls it is different - agent in native country offering them "works" in OZ and they 100% knows what to expect in this job.
The sponsor mostly pay tickets, visas, med and some money to the family on condition they will work certain time. Considering living condition in some
countries and that most of them already pros it is sensible arrangement for this countries. Coming here many of them very fast becoming smart asses
and try most tricks in the book to get out of an agreement to become "free" woman .It mostly mean make much more money for yourself.
I've seen ladies working 7 days a week - nobody is forcing them. I asked them why - some want to buy house/business in native country or go back
as a rich bride and improve social position for herself/family. So all this stories should be taken with a lot of salt and pepper.

The main fact - they know what they will be getting in and accepted it...

rumata, there are always two sides to every story. While I agree with some of what you say, I equally agree with Hard's point that if this woman is imperiled then hotwheels has an obligation to act on her behalf. We all are - if I go to a brothel and am introduced to a woman who I suspect is underage or a slave then I am obligated (both legally and ethically) to do something about it. This is black and white; even if the woman had come here knowing that she would be a sex worker. Where there is a grey area is what you say about her skills at psychological manipulation. And that is where hotwheels, or any other punter, needs to make their own call. But even if she a manipulative little minx, if she is endangered then one has to act. And that does not necessarily mean you have to spend any money on her.

Yes, SOW is right here. From what hotwheels has said, it would seem that the woman here is not a scammer but is genuinely feeling totally controlled and powerless. Also, hotwheels is not the unsophisticated, simple or unsure man on the internet. He knows the woman and feels her pain.

I do agree with rumata about many WLs and MLs who come here to study or by encouragement from sex worker agents. We all know them but we also know they are making choices - which they find very lucrative. I see this woman as different and if she is fearful and powerless to change her situation then it's unlawful. Whether hotwheel does anything is up to him. The girl may not want the boat rocked... if she definitely opposes any action on her behalf then be it upon her own head. In that case, hotwheels should walk... permanently.

Nobody has yet answered hotwheel's query about the mechanics of immigration sponsorship. My understanding is that it differs according to the bilateral agreements. So it is relevant which country she comes from and whether she is under or over 30. If she is under 30 and from Thailand, Japan or Korea then it's easy for her to get a visa - and this arrangement she is in sounds very murky indeed. But if she is over 30 and from China then my scam antennae would be primed. Of course, as I've said, regardless of her status, if hotwheels believes she is in trouble then he should act.

well iv been out with a WL that "paid " for dinner too. i was seeing her for a few months, would spend the night once a week , daytime outings etc. so really was a friendship with sex, all that aside, i discovered she had 2 other "friends" she was sleeping with as well. now the bottom line was she was fishing with three baits  at the same time to maximize her chance of landing a spouse visa. just me being single at the time was all that mattered to her. and the test she applied when i 1st saw her in the brothel was an unrequested love bight. same test all potential boyfriends got , so yeah this guy that stalks her outside work would be an ex client she married for PR no doubt. now he is a jealous control freak but she will put up with it , complain to hotwheels and others about it. but sounds like it was her choice.

I think this discussion is now going around in circles with some posts far too judgemental to be useful.

It is interesting - if not weirdly co-incidental - that just today, I had a massage session with a young MLC friend I've not seen for a couple of years. We have been very good friends in the past - as a client/ML relationship. She is in a sponsorship situation in which the relationship she had with her (Aussie) sponsor has broken down and they are now separated by different cities. It is not a problem for her and the guy is honouring the arrangement such that her PR should come through in the next few months. It then gets complex because she's struck up with another guy (Chinese) who is back in China but going through his own PR application. He already owns property here. She explained that once he comes out here she still cannot become permanently hooked up with him for 5 years after the original sponsorship PR has been granted. If the authorities become aware that she breaches this rule, then her PR is revoked. The system is extremely complex - and I suppose rightly so... although who knows how many visa overstays are really here. The govt estimate of 60,000+ is almost certainly well-understated.

I don't know if all that makes sense other than that the TV and PR application system is extremely complex and like many things, varies with every single individual. All I know is that in my ML friend's case she is definitely NOT under duress and is not being controlled. As I've said before, in hotwheel's case, the apparent duress is extremely concerning and almost certainly illegal. It's also agreed that the only person who knows the full story is the girl.

Unless there is anything new to be added to HW's story, I would prefer not to debate further except to repeat that whether hotwheels does anything is up to him. In the case of my friend, if I were aware she was under threat of harm, I would act. PR is not worth harm or even losing life or limb.

PS, in relation to the latest posts above, I never had FS with my friend and so her story is not compromised by circumstances of our relationship. Our previous and renewed friendship confirms to me that today's 'catchup' on her life is entirely genuine.

I've found the ones playing tic tac toe are easy to spot- they sometimes take a while to respond to a text, don't answer when you call, get calls from english speaking callers when you are in a session or worse when you are out with them. My advice- have fun but keep your hands up. But despite this they are not all the same and not all are playing several off at once.

Recently I was having a massage and in the middle of it the lady gets a text and gets agitated and asks me to respond in english to the text (the subject isn't important). Anyway I look at the text thread and the guy texting is saying 'i love you miss you' etc so I ask in chinese 'your boyfriend?' and she says 'no no no'.  Of course I had the good taste not to embarrass her by challenging her on it, replied in simple english and we went back to the massage. So have fun but don't take it too seriously.

SOW - I mentioned general case, not particular HW case. You are giving ABC of common law/sense - underage/slavery, that is  obviously should be taken care of.
But I believe that is only case in less then 10% of all cases. And I am writing ABOUT MAJORITY of such cases. 
Speaking of you views I find out, that you tend to look for excuses of bad service of some places you heavily promoting. You got excellent service, but other punters could not replicate it. I think we all deserve to be treated properly without excuses and some mama/papazan should lift the game and not asked some honourable members to write some excuses for them. It is no excuse for bad service.

So, some thoughts after watching this thread unfold.

1. Hotwheels is best placed to assess whether the lady is genuine or not. He knows her, he has spoken to her face to face, he has seen her facial expressions, he has heard the tone of her voice and all the other things that do not come across in the written word.

2. He has read the many words of caution written here (as have I - they have some relevance to me as well ...), and has probably taken them on board.

3. In answer to the question of how this sponsorship thing works - it appears to work differently depending on the precise type of visa (and there are many). The Department of Immigration's website (link to one class of visa posted by Wicked earlier) is probably as good a place as any to start, but you will need to know what sort visa.

4. Probably the wisest words said so far are:

and here is where the Immigration Lawyer would be very useful. He (or she) will know what is likely to happen if the sponsor stops being a sponsor (or is arrested and charged) - will the lady be deported? or will she be given some other sort of visa - such as a Woman at Risk Visa? And knowing the consequences, the lady can make an informed decision.

I am very glad I have never found myself in a similar position.

Ok.....since I started this thread....I feel I owe all those who have expressed their views an update on what's happened since I saw her on Sunday
I booked her for 90 mins....out of that I got 30 mins of massage and 60 mins of heart to heart talking.
The short version....
Somebody has told her that due to her situation, the easiest way to stay here is to form a defacto relationship with an Aussie and stay with him for at least two years..... wether this was good advice or not is anyone's guess.
 Her Aunt introduces her to a guy willing to play the role...........
A plan that has more or less backfired because he has taken the stance that she is now a kind of mealticket/servant that he can put to work (domestically and in massage) to supplement his income.... she wants no part of his assets....indeed, she hangs for the day she can just get away and stay here...she just wants to stay here with her mother and aunt (already here)....
Because of the circumstances, she now feels trapped and can't see a way out....she is loathe to complain because of possible repercussions with staying here.
The way I see it she has chosen her own path and really doesn't have a lot of options here...
She has more or less resigned herself to having to stay in this situation for at least another year.
As I said before......he takes her money and controls her every move.....he "allows" her to work 3 days a week with the other 4 spent cleaning and looking after the house.
The emotional and verbal abuse is bad enough.....but Ive told her that if he gets violent to call for help.....even if she calls me, I don't care.....I wouldn't like to see her get hurt (physically)...
Ive had to leave out shitloads of stuff shes told me because this post would go on forever....
Thats about it in a nutshell guys.....Im sure theres more like her out there in similar situations and it's naturally difficult to know whos "on the level" because of all the scammers out there...
Ive been involved with punting and M/L's  W/L's for 15 years now so I wouldn't class myself as naive.....this one I feel is genuine.....

Not heavily promoting any place mate. Not giving any excuses. If you have an issue with any of my reviews I suggest you comment on the relevant thread. Really don't appreciate gratuitous advice.

If you read the rules on the immigration website they must be together 1 year, before applying for the defacto relationship, plus a further 2 years. Domestic violence could be her way out, but then she will need proof of some sort! She is using him and likewise. Probably best to keep out of it if you ask me!

If he is pushing her to have a child, it sounds more than a marriage of convenience for money and a PR.  

As much as she says she is in prison, it was her choice to stay with the guy to get a PR. He may think she is staying for him and in a genuine relationship. I don't think you know the true story and both sides of the story. You are just getting one biased viewpoint.

It's extremely difficult for Chinese girls to come here to study/live, unless they are from a wealthy family and have the appropriate levels of education. The only way around it is to find someone willing to have a relationship of one kind., or pay a price.

True, very difficult and expensive for any overseas students to come to Australia to study and pay full fare plus living expenses !

But thats also a big export item for our economy !

A lot of the OS students have to show proof of family income before a student visa will be issued !

Then you have all those short term English study students = endless supply of young working ladies in escort services, brothels and massage joints! Without them, we probably not gonna have so much happy endings or will be paying a much higher price per punt !

Yeah, lots of these ladies young and older are looking for ways and means to either support themselves or eventually stay behind - Australia, such a lucky country for ALL !

These comments are correct and are strongly supported by some of the discussion I had yesterday with the girl referred to in my previous post. Working only 2-3 days a week in a relatively quiet MP - doing no FS - makes it very difficult to pay $200/week rent, education fees and have enough left to eat and have some semblance of a life. Parental assistance is paramount and obviously a major component of a visa system designed to create a strong benefit to this country.

I'd also add that hotwheels last post clearly supports the position I've taken in this discussion. The girl's position may not be unique but her particular treatment is almost certainly illegal.

Saw her on Sunday. ...she doesn't read English to well but I showed her this thread and went through the replies with her to explain her possible options. .
She was stunned that this site even existed. .lol ...bbut also touched that through the positive comments "customers" even cared about her situation. ...
I also showed her the thread about the lady from Sydney who was set on fire and badly scarred and what the " customers " had done for her and she started to tear up when she realized that many of us care about ladies in the industry more than they think. ..
I have given her advice about a few things she should put in place now to prepare for contingencies in the future should the need arise and she has taken this on board .
She has also asked that I thank the members here for caring about her plight even though she realises that it's through her own doing and asked me not to do anything about it as it's really "her" problem and no one else's. ...
She has said that the best thing I can do for her is be there when she needs to talk to someone as there isn't anyone in her life right now that knows the whole story.

Good call hotwheels. Ultimately, it's true that the best you can do is be there for her. These girls can get very lonely at times with few friends and limited financial resources. This saga demonstrates how easy it is for them to get into difficult or even threatening situations. Obviously, if things escalate to violence etc then alternative courses of action would be appropriate. Good luck mate

Tough call that...breaks the cardinal rule showing a ML the site and thread relating to her but this is an extraordinary situation and I hope the admin team will understand and forgive.  I truly hope everything works out for her on one hand but on the other hand it seems she is scamming us to get Australian residency and become another burden on the already stretched tax payer...
She should be protected against violence full stop but she shouldn't be here in the first place.

I have been reading this thread since it was first posted and wasn't sure where I stood until now once all the details were out and I had time to digest them.  At the risk of being condemned here is my 2 cents.  She obviously came here under false pretences it is a scam on the Australian tax payer, to which I am one.  The guy to whom she is with is also part of the scam as well as whoever arranged it.  It is never acceptable that anyone is put in danger of violence of any kind and if this is the case then it makes it more imperative to act and get her out of that situation.  That said I think she should be handed over to the authorities and deported back to china.  It is an affront to all the legal immigrants that enter this country, my wife being one.  
Ok What happens when she gets her PR and leaves the guy.....first thing is to register for government assistance, so now the tax payer are supporting her.  Next step is to bring over the relatives, mum, sister, brother, dad, cousin and whatever.  Now we have a number of family members who claim government assistance under various programs and so add to the already overburdened tax system.  She came here illegally because she was part of a scam and she should be returned to her country of origin and all other perpetrators in the scam prosecuted.

I'm sure it's not all that simple Granox. We don't know that she came here illegally. What you describe are well-known scams that are often bandied about as a usual illegal entry route. There are countless different entry permits and visa arrangements. It's quite possible that this girl came in by a quite legal process, study etc, not by some other path. As I recall back through the thread without reading it all again, there wasn't ever a suggestion she was here illegally, nor is she on the taxpayer take. It's the changed circumstances since she arrived that have indicated the problem. I'd suggest we leave the usual prejudices out of the discussion.

We've  all seen the regular emails that do the rounds about illegal immigrants, blah, blah, blah... but life isn't always that simple. Sure the govt spends ridiculous money on dealing with this problem, but this particular case isn't one of them for my money. Regarding immigrants, just thank our fucking stars we aren't as vulnerable as say, Italy, France, anywhere in Europe or UK actually. Not to mention southern US borders. Just as well we live on an island...

I tend to agree with Granox. She is obviously illegal and buying time till freedom. She will end up leaving the guy. He will be burnt one way, or another for helping her.

Chaps..

I think we can "see" a turn of events here about the "moral" and "value" aspect here..

Think the discussion while valid and conditional it will go to a he said.. she said point of view.. Unless we are "HTW" we will not know the full story.. "emotional" or "trivial".. 

So we give some benefit and empathy in the matter regardless of the many scenarios thrown around..

Think we can all move on and not let a valid discussion and advice become a "heated" discussion.. 

Move on chaps..

First and foremost if she is in any potential physical danger steps need to be taken immediately to secure her safety.

With all due respect Hard I read in HW's post "Somebody has told her that due to her situation, the easiest way to stay here is to form a defacto relationship with an Aussie and stay with him for at least two years..... wether this was good advice or not is anyone’s guess.
 Her Aunt introduces her to a guy willing to play the role..........." 
Now if she came in on a study visa and chose to change it in the way described above with a guy "willing to play the role"  that would be rejected by the authorities as disingenuous as it suggests the intention is temporary until the PR is obtained.  I went through the burden of proof needed to prove a loving relationship.  And in such a situation scam is maybe too harsh a word and deceitful would be more appropriate, and again I think she should be returned to her homeland.  If it was in the form of matchmaking and the hope was for a loving permanent relationship then that is a different story but again the view of the immigration department would be if that relationship falls through then the visa is cancelled and she returns home.
If this was organised from China and the intention was for it to be a temporary scenario then that is truly a scam and she should be returned home.  This is not heated and I have tried not to be derogatory at all and I have also tried to balance both sides moral and legal.  I am simply offering my thoughts on the issue and like I said I thought a lot about it before I said something.

 I showed her the thread to illustrate to her that not all customers are purely interested in just getting a massage/HJ or FS from ladies in her industry.
Fair to say.....there are many who really don't give a shit about them and after they leave the girl just becomes little more than a memory.....however,
I only showed her the thread relating to her and the girl who was set on fire to prove to her that there are many who care about them and accept that they to, have lives and real world problems just like the rest of us.......I wouldn't show her "reviews".....IMO that's taking it too far if you understand...

 Granox......I can understand exactly the point your making.....and although she was here legally her visa conditions would mean she would have to return home sooner or later.....but to clarify a couple of points......your phrase above has merit.......at first, she was matched with this guy by her Aunt.....she had hoped that it would turn into a permanent relationship but he has not turned out to be the person she had hoped he would be.....
Indeed, should the relationship fail in the eyes of the authorities, she may well be sent home....in addition, she attended university in China but the qualifications are not recognised here ( I have heard this same story from several ladies over the years now) and if she can attain residency has every intention of doing extra studies to gain her qualifications here so I can't see her being a burden on the taxpayer.

Such a difficult situation on all fronts. I have been that person that was being a good friend to a WL and all after we saw each other in a shop. Ended up falling for her, and that was the worst part. She wanted to stay friends but I wanted more.
I guess the worst part was falling for her.

My advice, be her friend and all but if you start falling for her than rethink your friendship. It caused me such despair when I realised that all I could not offer, was nothing she wanted.

I have worked in over 40 countries and I know that the mindset of Asian women is very different to ours.  For one a guy here considered not to be particular attractive is not seen that way by Asian women (generalising here) maybe to do with the large amount of western influence in their countries from business to TV.  Also age gap is less important and I can understand a single or divorced Asian lady having the opportunity to marry an Australian man is a wonderful opportunity for them not solely for financial reasons.  So genuinely she may have come here for the dream of a loving husband and for that dream to be shattered is a sad scenario.  WE don't know anything from the man's point of view either so we shouldn't condemn him either, we only have one side.
What will be interesting will be after she has achieved PR status what she will do.  If there is no financial necessity and she wants a relationship with you then your chances are that her intentions are true toward you HW but be careful because you may find that if you do not serve a purpose you will be discarded and I hope that is not the situation for you.  Unfortunately many times men such as yourself are stepping stones....oh Hi Rose Hancock/Porteous...didn't see you there.

WHOA!!.....stop the presses right there .....I haven't "fallen" for her in any way mate......I only started seeing her and talking is all.....fair to say....I'd like to see her do well but there's 110% no chance of anything starting with her.....she feels the same I know......right now, she needs friends much more than lovers.
I've heard so many horror stories about guys who have fallen for these girls only to be left broken hearted......same goes for W/L's who have become more than attracted to a customer......zero chance there mate!!......everybody knows exactly where they stand with me.....much better off for all to lay the ground rules from the start..

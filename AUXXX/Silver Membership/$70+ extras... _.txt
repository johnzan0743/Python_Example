 $70+ extras... ?
				
Post Content: 
I just thought I'd open a general thread on the pricing of private massages. Are people generally paying $60-70 for half an hour then $30-50+ for extras?

In Melbourne at least, you can get FS at a brothel for $110/30mins. Now I know there is a bit of a challenge aspect which ads to the experience, hence the punt. But are the massage shops getting a bit expensive?

60-70 sounds a bit over for a half hour. I think 30-50 is closer to average for the CBD for massage only. Extras (clothed hand only) I'd say 30 is average. Some ask for more but I've never been turned down when I push for 30.

I get a 30 min massage and hj for $50 at quite a few places. It still amazes me that people spend $30 for a HJ.

"Best I've found is $40 for 30min massage with hj included. Nothing else on offer and massage is not the best. But girls are youngish and ok looking.".....more info please

My experience is (Sydney metro) $35 or $40 for 30 minutes, plus $20 for handy, plus an extra $20 or $30 for nude.  

All up $75 to $90 for half hour including nude HJ.       

 You can get half hour FS in Hornsby for $90, but I like the thrill of the chase.....

(all this info is in the various reviews by many people).

$60-$70 will generally get you an hour around town. $40-$50 for the 1/2 hour. Even the odd spot where the massage will be $30 (in the west at least). Still plenty of HJ's to be had for $20 although some of the younger prettier girls will try and extract $50 out of you if they can.

Generally,yes.Speaking about Melbourne,there are still some places (mainly in the west) where the money you pay the house includes a tug but they are now in the minority.Assuming most places now leave the extras and pricing up to the individual girl you would therefore be looking for shops which have the lowest base rate for the massage.If nothing else is included,there's not much point paying $50 for half an hour if somewhere else only charges $30 or $40-you're already behind.

So it's just us in the East getting stitched up. Well, fair play I guess, lots of places getting raided or going bust.

Punters should establish an association to regulate this unregulated Market.  Punters in East should enjoy the quality rub as those who in the West

I find a lot of places now want $50 up front for the half hour and then you have to do some bargaining with the individual.
When you paid all to the individual you had better bargaining power.
So the venue is getting way more than a dollar a minute and you can end up with a crap  massage but you've already paid for it, so they don't really care if you don't come back.

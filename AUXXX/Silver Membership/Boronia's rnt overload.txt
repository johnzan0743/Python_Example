 Boronia's rnt overload
				
Post Content: 
This information is for melbourne punters.  After taking my friend the jet out to meet love in northcote, we headed to boronia for an appointment.  I told him from what i knew there were 4 massage shops within 500 metres of the boronia train station.  We did a quick sweep of the area and i showed him the ones i know of.  We then parked and walked around the arcade area near the shopping centre.  While we were killing time walking through the arcade section we were hysterical by the end, as we just kept finding more.We found  4 in the arcade section. .  All up we saw 9 massage shops with 4 exisiting in the arcade section, 2 on floreston  near cnr boronia rd and dorset rd, one next to tab on boronia rd, one opp dan murphys off that bornia rd and a new one 150 metres up the rd on right side on boronia rd heading to scoresby rd.   Im speechless.

Did you go in and have a look at each or only saw the signs? Pity you did not get their full addresses and phone numbers and sample a few so we had a bit more useful information.

The new one on boronia rode is 2 shops away from the VET! is it [COLOR=#ff0000]177 Boronia Rd Boronia[/COLOR]? The Vet is 181 where I take my family cat sometimes!

Boronia where KMart is, there are 2 arcades you can walk through that can take you towards the train station, they are easy to find, [COLOR=#ff0000]4[/COLOR] shops are there! The Tattooist there was not shocked when Brauninc told him there were 9 in this area! then on Boronia road another 2 heading towards Boronia Rd and Dorset Rd Intersection, pretty much opposite the Woolworths and the small petrol station there. Those 2 are only about half dozen shop seperating them!

Another one Brauninc mentioned is like a couple shops down from Stallions italian restaurant. Not the entry on Dorset Rd but you can park your car for this Chinese Medicine Massage shop in the big car park there also.

Another shop Brauninc mentioned near the TAB is also next door to a XXX Shop which is right near a shop called Indian Hub restaurant, so it's near[COLOR=#ff0000] 144 boronia rd[/COLOR].

Hope this helps out a bit more.

How on earth can all 9 operate and remain in business in the 1 suburb, especially if they are all around each other? What a joke!

Not sure if you mentioned this one but there is also a Thai place adjacent to Dan Murphys on Boronia Rd. As you drive into Dan Murphys car park there is a row of about 12 shops on your right and the massage place is down towards the Dan Murphys end.

In the last couple of years there has been a massive influx of massage shops in every suburb and shopping centres!

Every where I look, or drive I see the same format. Huge graphics on the windows. 

I don't know how they can all survive! It would also make it very difficult for the authorities to work out which ones are genuine therapeutic.

Must be a lot of cash going under the table. I'm sure brauninc's brain is on overdrive working out the figures.

I've only noted 2 in the arcades, 1 in each. There is a place called Han's massage or something to that effect, as far as I know, there is a Mr. Han in there, never seen anyone else around. And there is a new one in the arcade closest to the Boronia and Dorset road intersection, that one opened up about a month ago. So there are another 2 in those 2 arcades? The shop that is accessed from the carpark seems quite legit, I've seen it fairly busy at times, with demographics of the population who you would just know are not looking for anything but a remedial massage.  i think i have to go for a stroll soon.  

Oh, and in the Boronia Mall as well, pretty much in line with the arcade on the chandler road end,  I've seen one, always unattractive oldies in there though, so I wouldn't be going in there for anything at all.

Yup, agreed, but they are starting to get a little bit out of hand with their prices though, the girls have no idea about keeping the regulars happy. Find an "open minded" girl in there, and the total $$$ including extras is not far off a what legal establishment charges, with a hotter chick, and you play on a bed and get to have a shower, +, no need to fuck around with a bullshit massage, some of them refuse to start the session without a massage.  I used to be a regular here, but now I'm snooping around a bit again, mainly because of the girls in here pushing up the prices.

Good golly miss molly!

brauninc and myself ventured out to Boronia just earlier and visited all of these places and explaied to them there are 9 others in the area and we asked them how busy have they been in recent times.

1 was telling the truth which we could tell they were semi busy. 1 was closed today (thank god for that) 2 others said no they were dead, not busy for a while. and 6 others talked utter crap and said yeah we busy for a while, when you could just tell they were talking out of their arse and lying. 

Even 1 place chucked the shits at us and told us never to come back again, this was the Thai massage place near Dan Murphys. Only 1 lady working there who most likely owns the shop, most likely atleast early 40s with some scarring on er face most likely from smoking too much or being a druggo.

Why is there so many massage shops in the 1 area? Do they just come here and want a better life and think if they own 1 of these businesses they can easily get citizenship and spunge off society whilst their partner works his arse off to feed them both and possible if they also have any children?

1 place even had a women who was looking after he very young child (could only be about 2-3 months old at most). Who on earth would want to get a massage and happy ending when you head in to that shop only to see a lady with her baby there? Such a turn off.

Brauninc and myself were absolutely disgusted at these places. I guess in areas like Boronia where they have 10 or so, they are more than happy to just twiddle their thumbs and not make any money in the massage shops.

I want to add that of all the shops operating i believe the one on floriston rd near the cnr of bornia rd is the pick of the shops.  The 2nd busiest i believe is the one on boronia rd near the tab. The lady where told us she wasnt busy at all and was very friendly.  I wasnt overly disgusted but i do agree with the jet in that,  all these shops were asian run and i believe some are happy running the business at a loss, if there partner works and makes a pile of money.  Its a citizenship scam for sure, but we need real job creation and boronia has enough problems without more massage shops making the suburb look even more of a ghetto.

Was in the Boronia area yest and noticed a new one has opened opposite the Mc donalds on Dorset rd.  Was also in the Croydon area later on and noticed a new one opposite the Croydon train station on the side where the shopping centre is.  The advertising is on 2 sides of the shop,for a minute u think there are 2 shops, until u see both have the same number, therefore there are 2 entry doors lol, with an upstairs section with a couple of normal business's.  For anyone who has seen this 2 story building, it sort of looks like a control tower overhanging the railway station.

Go walking around Boronia & you literally can't turn your head without finding an RnT. It's the Easts equivalent of Sunshine.

Only tried the one near Biggin Scott, $80 for nude Bbbj from reasonably attractive girl, place was Busy with at least3 punters popping in; & Floriston Ave: girl Kate was smoking hot but $70 Nude with panties on & Princess attitude.

Anyone tried Maya bay Thai near the station?

Alice who was reviewed at 1336 centre rd Clayton early 2018 works a lot in this area now, in fact she works at 141 Boronia rd Boronia on her own both Sat and Sun. She is still a solid build with a cheeky attitude.  As she is working alone she may give u a bit extra than the usual nude hj.

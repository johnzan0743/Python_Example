 Central Brisbane (South Bank area) suggestions?
				
Post Content: 
Staying in the South Bank Area of Brisbane for a weekend, and looking for some suggestions for RNT or More places that are decent and located reasonable nearby. No wheels but can Uber/Taxi if its a good recommendation.

Thanks  in advance Team Queensland for the help. 

Regards

Your not to far from a lot of the action in Brisvegas, plenty just a short cab or walk and I mean plenty so just do come research, plenty of girls advertise in and around the city. A few brothels as well. They can be OK if nothing really tickles your fancy from the !privates.

My experiences in Auckland have been pretty poor. Nothing I could recommend unfortunately.

Been some years but the following are still around by the looks, been to both of them twice - highly recommended

Debonairs - in Mt Eden, caught a bus from the cbd, about a 10min trip. Had a mixture of ladies, mainly Caucasians when I was there, all very hot, and 18-25yo bracket.

166 Karangahape Rd Auckland - Another one with hot girls, all nations
There is one or maybe even 2 other massage places in this street, plus a strip joint. know as a red light district towards the end of the street. 

Pelican club is not too far from 166, maybe 15-20min walk. Its a brothel , probably the best in Auckland. Walk in and there is a bar and lounge, and available ladies all around. Can have a chat with a few first before picking one. If none takes your fancy just walk out. This would be the first place I visit next time I land in Auckland

Have fun

I was in Auckland in 2012 and really enjoyed it. I met a Russian student in an apartment near the water and an English Blonde (early 20s) somewhere in the city. I remember I found them here:
https://www.newzealandgirls.co.nz/
and
Private Auckland Escorts | NZs Cutest Elite Auckland Escorts

The rate was around 200 NZD. I think like Locanto these sites would also have lots and lots of fake profiles so its matter of chance as well.

Just checked the site again, Interesting design and this girl seems genuine: https://www.newzealandgirls.co.nz/al...php?more=33077
150 NZD for half, not bad I guess.

Two places that I went to when I was in Auckland earlier this year. Both R&T, ladies are nude from the start, young, mainly Caucasians, and very nice rooms, sensual experience. Cost was $160NZ per hour

The Brazilian PWLs are good value. Probably about the same price as a budget parlour in Oz. The rate goes up considerably if they can make it to Oz. NZG is good with adultforum.co.nz for intel.

I was in the area and popped in for a visit out of curiosity.

I don't have access to create a detailed review but can say that, hands down, I spent an enjoyable, relaxing 30 minutes with Linda. 

As Arnie says, "I'll be back"

I think this may be a sister shop to the boronia and Blackburn shops. Not 100% sure, but so far the names I've heard when calling all match up to those 2 shops, not to mention the receptionist sounds familiar.

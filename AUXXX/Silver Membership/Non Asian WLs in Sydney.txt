 Non Asian WLs in Sydney
				
Post Content: 
I've been punting on and off since 1999. Is it just me or has the sex industry on the cheap end been taken over by Asian ladies?

I found one directory which listed non Asian ladies and it only had 2 places at 121 Pyrmont and 219 Croydon Rd. Back in the day I liked going to Allures in Annandale which had nice looking non Asians at an affordable price, $120 for 30mins if memory serves correct. Are those days gone?

Yep. Those days are long gone. Back in the 1990s, there wasn't a huge price difference between Asian and non Asian. I remember a couple of wonderful punts at The Black Cat in 1998/99 where the price was $170 per hour ($180 if ypu paid by card). At the same time 12 Bellevue was about $120 per hour and Thai City on Albion St was about $150. Earlier this year (before it merged with A Touch More Class), The Black Cat was about $350 per hour, yet there are countless Asian places that are still in the $150 to $180 bracket. That said, there are some Asian places (Ginza comes to mind) that are charging something around $250 ph.

Or another example. In 2008 I had some pleasant punts at Victoria's Secrets at $250 ph. I then tried 116 Hampden at $150 ph. Now Victoria's Secrets is about $320 ph. 116 Hampden is still $150.

You can sort of attribute some of it to inflation, but also the fact that they're charging a price that we're paying.

In the Asian WL segment, there's a lot of them competing. Hence why the average going rate at least in Sydney suburban areas for a private Asian WL seems to be around $200 an hour and even lower (170-180 an hour).

Meanwhile, if you look on any advertising site, maybe a quarter of the ads on the page at any given time seem to be that of a caucasian advertiser, hence why they can charge more since there are less of them competing.

The is 8 Burwood as well for caucs bu that’s seems to be subject to an Asian invasion. Some of the bottom feeder places in toongabbie have some as well for 90/30. A lot of the price has to do with the cost structure. A city brothel would be crazy to charge the same as a shitty Asian place out rest given the capex for the fitout and the rent. A punters pockets are only so deep.it would be interesting to see how much places like Jingle Bells are turning over given the location.

26 Bourke Street, Alexandria is also another one. I think it is now No 24 after they had some renovation and changed address...not sure though. I haven't been there myself as I am quite lazy traveling that far - particularly crossing the bridge (Anzac, Harbour or Balmain makes no difference). But again the industry is flooded with Asians as we all know.

It's like everything else in this country. We import more and more cheaper goods. The goods that we continue to procure from here, rise in price due to the perceived advantage in quality, preferred status and reduced supply. 

It looks like we are well on our way to our first recession in a long time. Whilst this would also reduce the amount punters have to spend on workers, there may also be a rise in the number of workers as well, due to rising unemployment. That being said, with the rise in automation in the future, this may also increase the number of sex workers. I read somewhere that the world's oldest profession is also likely to be it's last. 

There's a whole different political argument about the working rights of international students in Aus. Should these rights be removed, it would be interesting to see what happens to the industry.

I remember Black Cat and A Touch of Class fondly. ATOC was $110 for 30mins and spent time with some great ladies. I think ever since Stiletto came on the market the prices for non Asians have kept going up. But who knows. If the economy is tanking, which I believe is happening in construction and retail, you might start to see more competitive pricing in the privates market. 

I also think the sugar daddy sites are now where the young talent is. A young hot thing can date older men for big dollars and when she is ready to settle down they can still explain that period of their lives away as flings with older men and not get branded a hoe. There would be a lot of appeal in that to have their cake and eat it too. If a young lass went to work in an establishment, private, stripper etc it would be harder to explain away further down the track.

Explain to who? It’s not something that a normal person of either gender to raise. No matter how it’s rebranded it’s whoring.

Explain to any who is nosey enough to ask why they went out with so many older men. Just because a guy chats up a lady on seeking arrangement and offers a deal doesn't mean they will jump at any offer. They aren't totally obligated to see anyone and generally are more selective of who they see. 

While if a guy calls up an escort, as long as they are respectful there is a certain expectation the guy will be able to make a transaction for commercial sex because the lady is a professional.

Wouldn’t these assignations take place in private? How would someone know in the first place what happens in a hotel room. I’m not familiar with SB’s but wouldn’t you contact one, go up to a hotel room and just fuck them once the deal was made? Why would a SB have to tell anyone they were ‘going out’ with anyone either?

Well they don't but if by chance they are spotted with their hook up it's easier to explain away then if they went full professional.

Why not say they are a work colleague instead or an old family friend. It’s not the 50s anymore. Much easier than coming out as a SB. Most cities are large enough to have dinner or rent a hotel room without bumping into someone you know.

Prices reflect what punters, rent in the area etc  and what the WL is willing to take.

A quick look at the various sites shows a whole range of different ages and services so it's a matter of what you're able or prepared to pay.

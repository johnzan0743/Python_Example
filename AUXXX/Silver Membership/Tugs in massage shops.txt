 Tugs in massage shops
				
Post Content: 
I see many punters giving in way too easily to the extras with MLs. 

Lately I have begun lowballing MLs and asking for a lot more than a HJ. At first they get upset and angry when I offer $50 for them to be nude/BJ but what ends up happening is their ridiculous $120-150 prices come down to somewhere close to what I can afford. But hey if i can get a nice massage and a BJ for under $100 I'd say that's money well spent

Remember that MLs do not earn anything besides what they earn from doing extras. The owners dont pay them hourly rates.  The power is in your hands!

At least in Melbourne - and in "middle of the riad" MPs - I understand that, this is not generally the case. MLs get a percentage of the house rate (not a wage) plus whatever extras they can get.

BB you are correct depending on the shop and the arrangement they have with the owner they can earn anything between 40% to 60% of the massage fee plus 100% of extras. I know this through a couple of owners I know.

I too do not think this si the case, in some shops maybe, but in others, there is a split.

My thoughts are that in many cases, the girls probably only get a few customers per day, so with the house split they may only end up with $100 or so after seeing maybe three customers.  COuple this with the fact that they are often dealing wth gents who probably havent had a shower, (most shops arent equipped) and are in various states of hygene genrally, i think its a bit rich to haggle too much. Imagine having to get your kit off and be requested to bbj a totally unwashed cock, or worse just imagine having to do the arse tickle with hairy arses smiling back at them, with possibly a range of non hygenic matter of varying density clinging to said hairs. Fuck me they earn every penny.

Agreed !

In most cases, the ML gets less than the shop from the basic massage fees, pretty sure say in Sydney, in shops charging $40 for 30 min, shop cut is $25 and the girl gets $15 and you can work out the rest. And while most of us RnT punters in this forum would probably go for the $50 tip for a NHJ (again, Sydney rates!) there are a lot of people who may only tip $20 for a clothed HJ, and in these slow days of winter, if the shop is not that busy, a ML could just get 3/4 jobs a day, and could end up only making around a hundred bucks !!

Thanks poundedhat. I always had the 50% figure in mind as the ML's cut. 

With one of my favourite ML's who I routinely pay extra to for a nice tug to go with the excellent massage, I will occasionally forego the HJ. She is perfectly happy for me to do that and I would be a bit concerned if she were not getting paid for her labour!

Oh and another thing. Treat them with contempt and guess what, youll get below par service if they bother at all. I love the comment in the post where he says the ml got angry.  I can only guess at the level of service provided after that little haggle. And hed be so welcome back!

I agree with exmelpunter, in my opinion the girls earn every cent that they get.

My experience has always been that if I am generous with my tips or extra payments then the girls are generous with their service in return, try and haggle and then you get what you pay for this is  no different to any other service industry

Hi Gents
After reading this thread yesterday I asked my Good Mamasan friend at one of my usual Hornsby haunts about the split. Newbies 40% Long term girls who generate regulars 50% maybe more! and all girls 100% extras. As mentioned present well groomed and respectful and the worlds your oyster. 
Yours in Punting

I agree entirely accept that "respectful" doesn't mean that you can't cheekily slip a finger up her fanny. You just do it with a little style and humour and without making the lady feel uncomfortable.  It is the great thing about your mid-range MLs (by which I exclude the BBJ/FS ladies) is that there is often a highly variable scale of what you can get and at what price. You can often buy a nude massage and, by treating her just so and with no more to pay, end up with your face in her pussy and her finger up your arse (assuming that is what you are after). Or you might pay for a clothed tug and end up with one hand fondling her tit and a couple of fingers up her pussy. And with the right approach (and a fair bit of luck) she might say to herself "You know, I didn't get a chance for a wank this morning. I might get this nice gentlemen to lend a hand"

That's an interesting approach, I'm used to a straight 50/50, but interesting way to take a little more of a cut from newbies and less from longer-term ladies who also get repeat visits. It makes business sense, although the lower cut for newbies could on one hand make them want to get more regulars to earn more, but on the other hand mean a higher initial turnover. Well, whatever works for the Mamasan, and of course all of this does encourage and potentially reward the ladies for looking after the customer.

Absolutely, and it also opens up other oysters, or should we say 'clams'...

This is where the whole YMMV comes into play, and why we are sometimes careful about describing and detailing 'extras', because a lot can depend on the customer and the interaction with even the connection with the ML, and even what sort of day she's had!

Customers who are 'respectful', repeat customers, all get better mileage.

This is also part of the odd appeal of massage places, you don't always know how far things can go, and the individual technique of each ML is different, not just in the rub or the tug but the transition between them and the degree of play and sensuality vs a more mechanical 'milking'.

On pricing splits, I think WAK was telling me that at some Singapore massage shops the house takes the full 'session' fee so that the girl's only income are the 'extras' ?

So not unusual for the girls to provide lots of extras.. getting expensive. So negotiation skills need to be sharp.

Guys just curious, how do you know if the girl is offering 'high end' extra?
I usually wait until we ended up dfk each other and pretend to be so horny and ask for a fuck....
To avoid doing something stupid, I limit the cash in my wallet...usually around 150 to 200.
The one that does it all the time asking for $100...
the newbies vary from 200 to 300...so far had only 1 success attempt with this type, haggle the price down to 150.

There are rare occasions when I am completely perplexed as to whether there is any possibility of hanky panky. I don't want to be offensive by straight out asking. 

FWIIW this is my acid test, and it has not failed me yet.

When she is massaging my chest, I ask, as politely as possible, if she would mind massaging my nipples.

No matter how gentlemanly my approach, if there is no sexual connotation to the massage, the answer is always a very definite NO. But at least I have not offended her, or embarrassed myself. 

If, however, my request is granted, I know it is ON. This gives me licence to over react about what a turn on it is, to feel her touching my overly  sensitive nipples. 

It can be the starter motor for a ripper session.

Excellent technique Panch. I have another nipple related tip. When you are getting a nude or topless HJ and the ML starts playing with your nipples, you can put your house on the fact that she would like you to return the favour, which often leads to more naughtiness!!

I have another nipple related tip. I offer them $20 if I can see their boobs. As a rule, if they take the money there's an excellent chance they will pull out their boobs.

in shops where I am pretty sure extras are on, when she comes back after taking the money I greet her starkers and ask about extras.

In shops where I am not sure, I strip to jocks and ask if I should take them off.     If she says yes then extras are likely - depending on her reaction and her attire I then decide whether to ask about extras or wait and see what happens..

Here's a whole bunch of tips for detecting and encouraging tugs and extras.

In pretty much every case, if you're asked to leave your underdacks on, a tug won't be available. Yes there will be exceptions but we are talking about 0.01% here, and if the shop or more likely the woman belongs to that 0.01% you will detect other 'signs'. In all other cases, respect that this woman and her service will be professional, have some respect for yourself and don't be that cringy guy who asks about a 'happy ending'.

You can generally tell if a place does extras by the 'look' of the shop, its opening hours (later is better), if there's a flashing 'massage' sign etc. Again there are exceptions. We've all been to a place which seems legit by every single measure and yet you can get a happy ending or more. There was a Chinese 'natural therapy' massage place on Archer St which was 100% legit but also offered extras. No, that's not a contradiction, it just shows that some ladies or even the mamasan will go the extra mile, and it can also depend on the customer.

Taking the above point into consideration, if there's a sign on the wall of the room which says "no sexual services" then 99.99% of the time this can be ignored because it's the 'get out of jail' card for the shop. What happens in the room will be between you and the massage lady. Even if the mamasan knows what's going on, and you can bet she does, she won't want to 'know'.

If the massage lady doesn't ask you to keep your daks on, then take the daks off, and if she doesn't say anything when she comes into the room and you are lying starkers on the table then can be pretty sure extras will be on the menu.

Again, there are exceptions. Some massage places want you to change into these thin fabric pants or a thin short PJ-style pants, and there are no extras. This is often the case with reputable Thai places. I've been in such shops, decided not to put on those pants, and when the girl's come in to massage me she says I have to put on the pants and will leave the room so I can do so.

And there are exceptions to those exceptions. I've been in shops where despite those pants, extras have been made available. What I'm trying to say here is that while there are no absolutely infallible rules, you can use the above guidelines to make a measured judgement most of the time, and most of those times those 'rules' will ring true.

Again, if you're starkers on the table and the girl comes in to begin your massage and says nothing untowards about your unclad state, extras are almost certainly on.

Great guide. Only thing I would add. If when you turn over the lady places a towel over your eyes so you can't make eye contact then that is a no extra situation. If the shop covers up the windows with signage so you can't see what is inside that is give away. If a shop was very poor signage because they don't rely on walk by traffic from mainstream folks then there is a good change it has happy endings. If the shop has a website with a gallery of ladies you can probably put money on it you can get extras.

The shop that I was shocked about which offered extras use to be in the Wynyard station pedestrian tunnel. Shop had no front door and only curtains to separate massage beds. Only went once out of curiosity and the lady wouldn't do nude tugs because of the unsecured nature of the place.

Ah, well you see, this is another one of those situations where there are sometimes exceptions to the rule, even if it's a 0.01% situation. And admittedly my experience was in a massage place in Singapore, in a suburb not far from the airport, where they have a few health spa places which have a bit of a mixed rep for delivering the goods.

In this case, the ML put the towel over my eyes, then started the front massage through a towel placed over my boy bits, and then nudged the towel around a bit as she massaged the upper legs, thighs and stomach towards the groin. It was odd because I started wondering if when she slipped out to return the wet towel after wiping down my back, if the woman who came into the dark room and had me turn over was actually a different and less attractive woman! So I nudged the towel covering my eyes back and nope, same woman as before. She kept the towel around my nether regions as she gave me a handjob, protesting when I tried to remove the towel because of the little window in the door, presumably the idea being that the mamasan can keep an eye on the ladies. Total nonsense, surely they know what goes on. Anyway, it was a bit odd but I went with it.

Just wondering if anyone has visited this lovely looker?

https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/chip...ney/1191362163

https://www.anastidamakeupbeauty.com/about

It appears all legit but she advertises a lot on Gumtree and that is a flag for me.

Thanks guys.


Seeing as how the Con Knee Leak thing doesn't appeal ...should just send her my CC with the PIN... save time being fucked over... 
but back to the question?

Brett1971 ...I will ask what may appear an obvious question. Are you referring to the Business which is separate from the named service provider who sublets a room from the business and conducts her own program inside of that room independent of the Hairdressing business?

Or are you referring to the business as perhaps is offered by the other tenants? Or is the statement referring to the above mentioned beauty/massage therapist?

Has anyone else had a wax or massage by this Hot Thai babe?

Clarification for the OP not as in butter might be better....

Gee....ist ghee

I was hoping that some of you members who enjoy a Braz .... I know it takes a special kind of person to enjoy having your crutch ripped out have had a wax by this lovely lass. I would like to know which way the wind really blows.

I think she works down in the bush for part of the week and returns Wednesday's to give things a tweak!

I trust that someone on the forum might have had a wax from this lovely lady who may be the way to relax.
Not concerned which way she turns just need information or intelligent converse.

Thanks again brett1971. 

I have now confirmed she has no problem with this but she has simply elected not to go down that track.

She is a lovely girl. 

I will see her but when I have more time. I think she probably has no problem with shooting a load but only in the context of arousal whilst having a wax. 
I don't have those sensitivity issues so likely I might have a wax down the track when I need one.

Fairly close to that now. Hence the search.
My regular is unavailable and the Tempe lass has an unfortunate situation that might alarm some punters. I won't be subjecting myself to dangers hence my treading with extreme care ATM.

So just to confirm 5 Queen at Chippendale is a quantity yet to unfold fully however at this point in time. There are questions about issues of some situations that are not clearly defined. However ATM there is nothing overtly on offer.

Shae is lovely however her partner who has serious mental health issues is either coming out when you are going into the complex. She has to come out to the door to let you in. If you see her in the morning then he will usually be exiting when she comes to let you in.
If you visit her in the afternoon then he will likely hang around and she will suggest you not be too vocal. He is not violent towards males but it can be a little unsettling if you are having your hairs ripped out or dick pulled whilst thinking he could enter at any point.
Realistically this is not going to happen as he is aware she pulls dicks and encourages her to see clients.

So she has informed me. 

So if he is exiting when you are entering he doesn't have a key to re-enter the building so you can relax. This happens usually only in the morning.

Btw don't engage her in conversation about the boyfriend as she is a passionate supporter of his rights but likely doesn't see herself as an enabler.

The massage is really good. She literally does one side and then the other. It is unique and feels great.

She does have some health issues but they shouldn't affect you.

Hope this helps. Reply here if you need more info. Thanks oztone.

Thanks for the thorough reply. I think I will give her a miss. Until, at least, the BF issue resolves.
It also explains why she did a last minute cancellation on me a few weeks ago, when she had to go the the doctor. I thought it was suss, but based on your account, she is probably legit in that regard.

Yes it is unfortunate that her domestic relationship has left her in a potentially dangerous and difficult situation. It is a salient reminder that when we enter the homes and work places of service providers that we need to respect the space and understand there can be awkward moments as we really have little insight into the domestic pressures and happenings the provider must endure or indeed encounter in order to provide the service we seek.

That said Shae has a number of challenges. If we know someone with mental health issues or diagnosed conditions we must also surely realise someone has to care for them. We should be mindful of supporting where possible these individuals.
However there is no reason we should risk our health and well being for those who have chosen the path of supporting an individual or group who have mental health diagnoses and ongoing issues.

This does not however apply to those we would label " mad fucks!"

Anastida allows you to be undraped on your first visit, and, on your second visit allows you to relieve yourself in front of her. However, she will not touch the goods.

Esstudio Galleria (the hair and beauty salon that Anastida provides her services out of) is 100% legit. As such, it is paramount you remain as quiet as possible when relieving yourself in her room.

Anastida is a capable Brazilian waxer and masseuse. I highly recommend both her services.

I hope this information helps - cheers!

It is good to see a post that succinctly provides the essential details about a service and its provider, without deluging us with a torrent of verbose fantasising and idle speculation.

OK, I have just returned from a Brazilian by Anastida. She is professional, thorough and 100% legit. I did not even bother asking, it's that obvious she is legit. She works at some high end hotel day spas around the city as well.
She is pricier than what I normally pay, although I was very happy with the service so didn't think it outrageous cost.
The past couple of years I have had  back, sack and crack done at 197 Clarence St, City. This is a RnT joint that doubles as a wax place as well. The contrast between Clarence St and Anastida is stark. Anastida's room is in a very funky hairdressing place in Chippendale. The place is uber clean, chic and professionally set up. This includes a range of wax types, lots of gloves, masks, sterilizers and a great lighting set up so that she can see those short and curlies very clearly.
She is thorough. The whole back, sack and crack takes about a half hour at Clarence st. Anastida took over an hour to do my balls, shaft and crack. I made another booking for next week to finish off my butt and back and shoulders. 
And she is a great conversationalist with an excellent command of English, notwithstanding a Thai accent.
So, while pricier than others, she gets my vote for being clean, thorough and professional.

Thank you Oztone for the thorough description of the wax sesh...

I think it is a ( pun warning) hard thing to do...ouch determining whether to handle the goods in front of you for a little bit more for a lot more cash to time spent ratio... after all it is not that much more you need to get involved with a result...looking at things from a workers POV...

I know some waxers who have wanked before and elected to go straight.... The issue is one of conflation as opposed to one of inflation except for the Greek lad called Con. He would likely disagree ....

Still it is great that she knows her way around a cock without the need to rip. However the inflated pricing probably puts her out of reach of many. But hey if you can afford a wax you ain't that poor ...

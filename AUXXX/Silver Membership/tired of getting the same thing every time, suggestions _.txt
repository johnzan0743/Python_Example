 tired of getting the same thing every time, suggestions ?
				
Post Content: 
ive been punting a lot less lately as its getting boring for me.

lets say, for out of 10 RNT experiences i have, only 1 of them would make me have a fully satisfying experience, the other 9 would have some sort of issue (clockwatching/finishing too early, expensive extras, massage being interrupted, massage skills terrible, unattractive bodies,etc etc) which leaves me disappointing and feeling money was completely wasted. 

I've been thinking of trying out BDSM or cuddling services for something new. 

open to suggestions. or maybe independent escorts who will come to my place for a reasonable rate (not $500 per hour lol, prob 150-200)

Maybe the private sector through skokka or kissyoubaby.  These  apartment places can be exciting at first until u realize fake pics rule the roost. Sometimes, but it is rare the girl is better looking than in the picture.There are massage shops that operate out of apartments as well as the full service ones. How about a visit to a brothel Sribrah?

Yes agree with brauninc,check out the reviews of girls in a brothel close to you.outside of the cbd,($150/hr)full service shops are way better value than a massage and hj with much more fun to be had..

Go for a fs shop. Just explain what you want and play out your wildest desires. Don't be embarrassed, they have heard it all before.

I have never understood why anyone bothers with RNT if you can get FS for a similar price.

I've been to countless massage shops none of which offer FS (still searching for one for the thrill of it).

Brothels - been to many, had a few great experiences. but most were bad

It's the thrill of the chase.  It can not be matched in a brothel i am afraid.

Sribrah 3 in Ferntree Gully,2 in Boronia,I in Mitcham(private apartment),1 in East Ringwood,I'm sure they are everywhere you just have to ask!Usually I ask at the end of the first visit,if they say maybe next time,then see them again,once they have your trust/patronage things can change quickly to a yes!,if they say no after the first visit don't go back.Works for me!

I find if you massage the lady and succeed in getting her off (orgasm) your chances of FS then, or on a later visit, are enhanced, but it doesn‚Äôt always happen.

Agree that with RnT - it‚Äôs the thrill of the chase.........

You are not trying hard enough Sribrah. I only go to massage shops and I have had FS hundreds of times. In fact that is what I go for and am rarely disappointed. PM me or look at my reviews if you want tips about where to go.

Yeap, totally agreed! 

But I'm such a lazy bugger and don't go down on MLs so my chance of giving them the big O was minimal!

I had, however, managed to oil massage a fully shaven pussy and pretty sure she came or she was an excellent actor ......... haha

Ps, didn't get to fuck her of that occasion though, firstly my 30 min was nearly up and I had no dom, but she gave me a great bbbj while she was still laying there and I was standing next - the same position when she came , she basically just turned her head and take me all in after she caught her breathe a bit ! I call that a great PSE in my review I think, minus a few details ......... of course !

Ps2, came back the following week well  prepared and pay for the privilege for part 3!

Thrill of the chase is gone in Sydney at least. I have FS every time I go to a massage shop, instead I'm disappointed if FS is not on the menu. Expectations too high...

For me, I find that getting FS in a massage shop in Sydney is trivial. But getting a decent RnT seems to be much harder.

I vote skip the crappy fake massage,(most of them dont know how to do it anyway) and offer a slow hand job session that keeps you on edge till just before time is up!but I suppose it wont work as it may be against the regulations of their licence...

It may seem counter-intuitive, but for me becoming a regular at a shop has created opportunities that have kept things interesting in the RnT space. New girls off the books, RnT experiences less ordinary, etc.

I must be an outlier. I can still count on one hand the instances of being offered FS in a RnT shop.

I agree....I am mesmerised by RnT...out of many experience I have had only a couple were below par....I have been fortunate that every ML has shown keen interest in working on what I like...then again maybe I expect too little üòÅ. Most have given a genuine GFE. I have been offered FS on few occasions but that is not a thrill for me...BBJ...only 2 times and cbj.. mostly but I give it a pass most occassion. I find thrill in ML getting friendly and happy by end of an hour's session. I must say that if most of the MLs I have been with were in some other line of work they would be on top of the game....all have been very professional and honest so far....but as most seniors always say YMMV.

For me, the search is more about finding a quality rub which equals a quality tug, and it's a bonus if quality extras are available. For any new shop or new massage lady I'll usually book 45 minutes and only extend to the hour during the session if the massage is very good. Shops that get my repeat business tend to have good QC when it comes to the massage ladies they hire.

Agree with Flyboy, in fact, from how I have experienced the RnT world, if you don't have quality rub, the tug is not often that good. The ability to do the former requires some good ability to know how my body works, so if the rub is good, the tug almost certainly will be good. 

I can only think of a few instances where that wasn't true, but then I asked them to do things a certain way and bam - that one is one of my favorites now.

 How to write the title of your review correctly.
				
Post Content: 
It is important all reviews have the title written correctly. It is especially important when starting a new review thread. It is good for the forum aesthetically, making threads and reviews easier to find, and having the correct details in the title makes for more efficient searching when using our search function.

The preferred formats for titles are as follows.

PWL/PML Forum
Name - Location+State - Phone number

Establishments
Establishment Name - Suburb+State -  Phone number

Massage parlours
Establishment Name - Suburb+State - Phone number

Escort agencies
Establishment Name - Suburb, State or Touring - Phone number

Landline phone numbers should also include the State prefix eg;(02) NSW (03) VIC.
If no phone number is available (eg; the provider specifies email contact only) add the email address or preferred method of contact.
For moderation/admin purposes do not indent, italicise the words or use characters such as @ etc.

 Cecilia Friggin Italiano
				
Post Content: 
Now  I usually don't pick on tourists however there are certain expectations that Aussies must be simple and open their wallets and hearts to those who deem us worthy of a visit to ... "downunder".

This lady is one of those. Works illegally for a week or two and then tours the country for a week or two pisses of back OS and has little conscience about breaking laws governing visas permissions and  just pisses all over the regulatory system that others are required to abide under and by.

She forecast her tours and advertises for the upper end of town who love a European accent and slender curves. She is working out of Sydney's exclusive Eastern Suburbs Double Pay... you get the picture?!

Her URL is here WHO AM I | Cecilia Frigerio

Hide your wallet when you find her pricelist for sensual massage



Nice enough looking lass however the roster of ravishing beauties existing legally within the coastline of Aus will not take a backseat to this price gouging princess.

So sorry Cecilia you won't be breaking my heart or taking my confidence daily or even weekly let alone monthly or yearly.

Support your local sex machine and give this girl a Miss!

The above link is a link to the current Gumtree ad for her services ....

The below link will explain why she is all about the business.

https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-seller/...4905870/date/1

It is of course up to the reader to decide if they will see her. 

If you do don't forget your wallet.

Cecilia you're breaking my heart (Song title)

By the Vamps. For those older members and punters... 
In case you were wondering....

I should point out I have nothing against this lady aside from the fact she is undermining Mr Potatoe Head's reasoning by not being French and not being A Pair. (sic)!!!

I wish gboat no pool here.
I just showered and walked dripping wet around the house and when I was dry did the same lol, spent most of the day in the shower. However I did have to cancel a 4 hour booking for this evening as they don't have air con sadly.

Leah, sorry for not replying sooner. 
No it was not hot yesterday, and at the moment it is raining. The forecast for the week is mild, mid 20's I think.
If you are coming down, please let us Melbournites know. There may be some business we can attend to. Wol.....

I work from home and my office is air conditioned 

Also it's a terrace and it takes a few days of heatwave before the place warms up. With terraces on each side so we insulate each other.

When is a hot day too hot for sex, or even RnT?  That will be my experiment this summer.

After all, we must be prepared for the effects of climate change on all aspects of our lives.

Not if you are having a cold shower with your favourite big tits massage girl and she knees down to give you a BBBJ ! 


With hot water in her mouth !!

A very different kind of fire/ice experiences !!

Or in winter, while you are having a hot shower and she sucks me in cold water .........

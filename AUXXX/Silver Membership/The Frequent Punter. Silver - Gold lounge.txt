 The Frequent Punter. Silver - Gold lounge
				
Post Content: 
Not at a loss , but still curious 

I'm assuming there are more silver members on the forum, over gold. However I note gold has significantly more  threads in the lounge 

Any reason for the difference ?

Is it simply gold by dint of the requirement and privilege, has more active diligent menbers ?

or is it that silver still post a lot though  in the general open forums ?

Bingo!

Gold status has to be earned and is offered to the creme de la creme of reviewers on this site. These are guys that punt once or twice or more a week and consistently share their intel on  the Forum  with quality reviews. The intel in Gold is significantly 'better' due to a higher level of security keeping prying eyes out, and the trust factor between Gold members.

Given that the essential requirement for Gold is basically lots of reviews it seems an inevitable result that Gold members will have lots of posts.

 Factors affecting survival of RNT's
				
Post Content: 
Hi I wont bother putting in a template for this one as I have reviewed Tori multiple times and you guys get the picture. Anyway went to visit her the other day and after the massage is over she made a couple of comments which I found interesting and wanted to get the opinion of everyone here

1. she said business in the parlour has been very quiet in the last couple of years
2. she said the younger generation guys do not seem to be going to RnT/FS joints any more as they can go on websites where people hook up and fuck (she named some sites but i dont remember the names)
3. there are lots more private joints, but she seems to think point 2 is making this point invalid as well

Just wanted to get an opinion on what other people think with regards to these comments. 

We speculated rising house prices also is a culprit to less business for this line of business

I personally think that the incredible increase in the number of RnT shops is the major problem. I live in a very suburban area but within a mile of so of my place there are literally dozens of RnTs (and the Burwood shops are included in this count). They can't all being doing well! Too much competition and too much choice for us punters. There was a time when I tried to sample all local shops but there are too many now and so I stick to the tried and true. I had a fair massage and sex the other day for $50. That's how desperate some local shops are. This is not a complaint obviously but just an observation on the challenges facing RnT shops.

Supply and Demand are the laws here.

I remember back in beginning 2012, when I first discovered Snow Lotus at 2/741 George St, it was doing very poorly. But the shop keeper was very good and she deserved better, with a bit of help from some of her regulars and being the first ever RnT shop to advertise in the other adult forum, her business had taken off very quickly. But that also thank to many top class MLs she had at the time: Tiffany, Cici, Ada (aka Coco at Stanmore), Linda (aka Candy ex QVB and now VIP Pyrmont), Sherry, Joey (still there!), Mia and many many more !! 

And back then, Silver Fox (376) was just opening, same for 316 Central. but there was no 370, 374, 378, 380, 227, 1A/1B QVB, None of the Pyrmont shops was  there, nor the two Divas, and no Sussex Star as well. No Bamboo (650) and 651. 

There you go, and you can add another 10-12 shops along George Street these days as well. So where the bloody hell were all the customers. They are there alright, just too many bloody shops.

I think you will find that it will follow most models of business survival
Supply and Demand and also service and quality and pricing.
There are limited customers and some offset this by being a semi-legit business that offers extras on the side.
Other businesses offer quality girls to find their niche. Others offer cheaper prices. 
The good businesses that have clean premises and offer quality ladies will probably survive.
This is why we see many massage places close down as their service is below par.
This forum allows us to report and to see which premises offer a good service and which ones are rubbish.
Punt. Report and we will all benefit.

An oversupply hasn't led to a decrease in cost, which bucks most basic trends though I can understand why (overheads in Sydney are getting absurd). I have no real interest in an RNT, though I prefer the freedom of choice FS provides and like to have longer sessions. I don't think Tinder has anything to do with a downturn, really. It certainly hasn't stopped me from punting.

Yeh tindr hasn't changed much. There has always been ways for younger people to meet and hook up. Facebook, MySpace etc while not as direct as tindr it is still much the same theory. Boy finds girl on internet, boy tries to charm girl and hit on her, boy meets girl for sex. 

There is definitely a lot of rnt. It surprises me how many there are and its true they can't all be doing well.

I think in real terms there has been a decrease in cost. I have been punting seriously for 5 or 6 years and at most places in the suburbs at least, I am paying the same prices as I was back then. FS after a massage has been $50 in Campsie for as long as I can remember. I know inflation is low but this is still a price reduction in real terms. The local shops just can't afford to put their prices up and in many of the legit shops the prices are actually going down.

Tinder was a game changer if you are ok looking or better though. Rather than the regular dance of meeting people, being nice, playing silly games, working out if they were up for it or not, you suddenly had a method of screening hundreds of up-for-it girls in minutes, having a quick chat online and then organising a date which usually leads to sex. 

Having said that, Tinder would have no impact on RNT business. Even when I was getting some, I still like the idea of a massage and being wanked off during a workday lunch break.

 Factors affecting survival of RNT's

From what I have read lately girls are asking up to $150 for a nude body slide. Girls want up to $50 for a HJ, without any touching. 

Escorts want up to $800 an hour and even brothel girls are pushing the extras! I won't do this without $$$. 

Now a whinge that business is quiet! Hey plumbers get $78 hr according to tonight's news. Not many people make more than $20 hr, unless they work at the top end of Australia Post. 

Drop your prices, improve your service, try to smile and pretend you're enjoying it and there maybe a rise in new erections! Before Tinder, there was the local pub, or night club to pickup. Not my scene, but I'm sure it also lead to plenty of hook ups.

Foreman that is exactly my point. How come privates can still afford to ask for 400 an hour, which seems to be the average when if you open backpage there is heaps of girls on offer. I understand their over head is low but is it really that low?

Girls can charge whatever they like. They all try to attract different markets. If a girl in RnT asked for $400 hr would you see her? Are escorts over $400 all busy? I don't think so. There is so much competition now.

I agree. You charge whatever but the market is what the buyer is willing to pay. Talking of which has anyone haggled and how to do it while someone is caressing your member

If you want to haggle, you do that before they grab the sausage. You can offer less. I have and they usually say yes. If they aren't that good looking and want $50 for a HJ, I say no thanks. People try to bargain all the time. I'm sure these girls haggle when they go to market.

Good luck to them all !!

I am a once a week RnT punter and my budget is $35/$40 for a 30 min session and $50 tip, take it or leave it. Sure, some girls may give me a little bit more extras but I think I earn it for being nice and a regular - don't we all? 

Occasionally I may indulge myself for a FS session and I'll pay the $100 tip, and that's my upper limits, unless if I have a big win in the footy or the Slippers which is few and far between.

Cheers

I like Chinese girls. When I first started punting it was strictly full service but the last 12 months I've gravitated to RnT.

Haggling is part of the culture, its like a game . They think you are dim witted if you give in too easy or a tight arse if you bargain too hard. Ideally both parties are happy with the outcome.

 There is something for every budget. I reckon Sydney is punting heaven, no complaints what so ever.

Uber is to the Taxi industry

To what Craker, Backpage, Locanto, Craigslist, Tinder, WeChat etc etc is to the RnT industry

My 2 cents worth (includes GST)

Sorry but the analogy totally escapes me. Don't some of these advertise/promote RnT shops.

If an app existed where the punter put out a tender for services and what they are willing to pay. The service providers then bidded for it, now that would be a dream as you would get the best price hahaha

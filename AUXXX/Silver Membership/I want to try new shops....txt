 I want to try new shops...
				
Post Content: 
I’m posting this here as some of you experienced punters might be able to add to my intel, and perhaps this will provide some useful info to you guys as well.

I like to see different girls and I’m currently at the stage where I’ve seen nearly all the girls currently on the roster that appeal to me at my favourite shops eg 142, 533, Kelly’s, Yoko’s, Roseville, 60 Chatswood.

So I’ve decided I need to visit some different shops and I realised I knew little about the other shops out there so I’ve done some research.

Please let me know about any shops I’ve overlooked or ones when my info (price, services, etc) is incorrect 

Firstly, I have some criteria about the type of shops I want to go to….

Criteria
FS shops, not privates or MPs where you can get FSNo more than $160/hrBBBJ included in the priceI punt during the day so I’ve listed the daytime ratesI usually avoid shops with tiered pricingWithin about a 75 minute drive, so metropolitan Sydney plus Central Coast and Newcastle

Obviously, shops I’ve been to are not included…..

Shops I’ve been to:
Hornsby 142533 Willoughby105 PymbleRoseville RoseKelly’s Five DockBonza BeautiesYoko’s Rydalmere78a Artarmon116 Artarmon60 Chatswood64 Taren PointRoyal Asians19a Lipstick7 Cowper12 Bellevue143 Marrickville47 Sydenham RoadClub 102 LiverpoolAsians of Smithfield90 Hotham350 ChatswoodTaylor’s of Lidcombe249 Queen St, St Marys391 High St, PenrithMaggie’s Parramatta295 Ashfield12 Norfolk, Greenacre

So I went through the shops on AuXXX, firstly the ones that advertise here and then by the geographical segments used on the forum.  I looked at all the shops that have had some activity on the forum since the start of last year.

These are divided into shops I might try and ones that I have excluded as they are above my preferred price limit.

Hey NB, I like this thread , but you missed my Favourite, Busty Fiona’s at Penrith. She has 2 ladies usually so I’d call it a private shop. $140/ hour.

If I was you.. I'd make my way through that list!.. no need to ask!.. lololololoolol

A true punter never walks.. it's the "thrill of the chase" as said by Thomas Crown!.. A mantra that is instilled in me by my Bros SOO aka Edd 'Kookie' Byrnes and BB aka Efrem Zimbalist Farquar (P.Diddy) and also dear dear Uncle Jack Kerouac..

Also the wisdom of The Capt..  Captain Searay..

Newboy,

Just a quick point. There are many members who prefer to punt. That is take a chance that a ml will at the end of the time allotted get their jollies by giving you some jollies and sometimes for no charge. That is many members prefer to take the chance that perhaps they might get some action where it is unexpected.

As a punter/ member you elect to see wl's who work from parlours and there is little to no punting. Indeed you have only to risk the level of service or the level of looks or attractiveness. Thing is your style of activity is predicated on a sure thing. The quality of service is down to an individual taste and therefore reveals itself in the interaction between the individuals engaged in the activity.

You have a very narrow focus. Many on the forum are way more open to different experiences and therein lies the rub. ( pun intended) the thing being many members use this forum as a way of sharing intel on massage parlours both legit and openly offering sex services. Thing being there are many private massage therapists who make the punt more exciting along with challenging.

May I make the simple observation that perhaps it is a turkey shoot that you enjoy. Don't get me wrong I enjoy knowing what I am getting or will get when I seek a service. However the legwork and congrats goes to your level of compilation and research into the subject of Brothels that charge below and above a certain criterion.

I fear a number of members will have glazed eyes after reading this thread...

But that is to be expected.
Apologies but I cannot assist you as for health reasons I never attend a Brothel or anything other than private workers...

Well done on the exhaustive list. I fear that there won't be a lot to add to this list.


SR.

There is enough her NewBoy, to start a R&D and a thesis on punting in Sydney. Well done and am sure we are looking forward to responses. I would recommend Vixens. Although have not been there for a while the choice of girls was amazing and they kept adding newbies to the roster...The Steed

That's a huge effort just to do all the research on these shops, most of them I haven't even heard of, so I'm not sure if any one can top them ?

And being a Gold member, Newboy will have all the access to those highly classified intels as well, like AB said, just work through your own list will be some achievements !!

Go Boy, hopefully some of your reviews will be outside of the Gold so that more people can share and benefit.

Cheers

Amazing effort, planning and research Newboy. I'm impressed that you keep up the pace  But geez, maybe you need another interest... for the adrenalin rush, why not race cars or jump from a plane!!! 

However, I tend to agree with sleazy. I'm another who likes a challenge and mostly, I only find that thrill-of-the-chase in a MP. To me there's little challenge in a FS shop... only variations on a theme. The 'theme' itself can vary but it's almost always service as expected or requested. While often it's service as expected in a MP, when that full-on extras challenge is met, the enjoyment/satisfaction surpasses expectations in a brothel. Perhaps by exploiting a 'charm factor', there's often that sense of having successfully pushed a boundary.

Horses for courses of course, I've had plenty of excellent FS shop fun, a few privates... and shock horror, an occasional TS 

But I guess we're all looking for new experiences... and these always make the interesting reviews.

To wit... of course we know you will provide many more readings! Impressive!

I think Newsboy is limiting himself by excluding budget cauc places like 219 and 8 Burwood. You can get 45 minutes for 160 as well. That really leaves only the Asian places. 

I never punt at Asian places nowadays because they seem fairly indistinguishable as sexual partners. Out of the hundreds of Asian I've fucked I can distinctly remember 4 of them. I can understand if you have a high sex drive and just want the volume but the lack of any cultural or language connection leaves me feeling empty. On a recent trip to Bangkok I had only 1 girl and didn't feel the lack of punting was any great loss. I would rather have the memories of a great sexual encounter than just temporarily empty balls.

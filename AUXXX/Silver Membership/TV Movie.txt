 TV Movie
				
Post Content: 
Recently I recorded a movie from the TV.
It was called, The Grand Budapest Hotel. 
In one scene a guy goes to a room in the Hotel.
The numer of the room will be familiar to many guys on this Forum.
I could not help myself. I had a quiet chuckle.
My wife asked me why I was laughing. Ha Ha.

 Massage parlours open late in Melbourne ?
				
Post Content: 
I've found it pretty hard to find massage shops that operate after 10pm in Melbourne. Usually if you want a 1 hour massage, 9pm is the absolute latest.

Can anyone recommend anywhere? Doesn't have to be Melbourne Central, but the closer to the city the better. 

The only  place I know that is open after midnight is http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f139/r...-4886-a-17514/ . 

http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f143/o...-6157-a-20348/ advertise after hours massage by appointment as well.

Bodyline is open very late but you will have to pay a bit more to indulge.

Thanks guys. Will look into Lotus. Bodyline and Barabings I knew about, but they are much more expensive, especially for an hour + extras.

Any others? I'm working a lot of hours at the moment, so getting an after work massage and having to be there by 9pm can be tough sometimes.

Pacific Brown, I have been to the lady in Epping. Not a good experience. The massage was not very good, and the HJ was not great.

Person's Name : Can't remember

Establishment : Private house Epping

Date of Visit : July 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0466 263 211

Hours of Business : 24 hours

Rates : $60/half hour nude massage

Age : 50+


Size/shape : Hard to tell, it was very dark!

Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie

Services Provided : Massage / HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Not for me

I see her number in the local paper and decided to give her a go. I don't remember exactly when I went, but it was daytime.

She is friendly enough, her rates are reasonable, and the massage room is warm, with great dim lighting over a little water feature. She is an older lady, and I couldn't see her well in the dark lighting. She kept her panties on, and wouldn't let me touch. Her massage was OK, and the HJ was OK too. It just wasn't for me.

Thanks Fartichoke for reminding me to post this revue. Sometimes you forget!

So far it looks like Royal City is the only one open late that has extras? Based on the reviews, Lotus at 178 Collins is legit massage only. 

The girls at Royal city do give a good massage, but doesn't seem like the cleanest venue. Nothing like the photos on the website anyway.

You could also try Urban Spa, but I'd not recommend it. Of course, YMMV.

Royal City is clean enough. It's a bit of a weird experience with the Spa/Sauna arrangement but you can just get changed and avoid all that if you don't like it. It's open well past midnight and pretty sure it's all you'll find that late. 

the place above the hair dresser in Little Bourke St (just outside Paramount centre) was open until around 11. Maybe still is. But recent reports suggest they've gone all legit on us.

Kneads is good for young euro/Caucasian types but pricey as! Looking at $50 hj, $80 topless, $100-$120 full nude/bodyslide/exchange. Although prices ( & other extras ) depend on the ml

I didn't know how dire the massage punting situation was in melbourne until I came to this forum, I sympathise for you brothers. You got far better strip clubs than sydney does, (i've cat bathed a naked stripper there in a private show) but man what kinda Stasi rules apply to massage places??? as much as i absolutely detest living in sydney i can't migrate away for the simple fact there is no other massage scene in oz like it

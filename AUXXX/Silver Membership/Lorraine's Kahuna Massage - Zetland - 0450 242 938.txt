 Lorraine's Kahuna Massage - Zetland - 0450 242 938
				
Post Content: 
[Please note two things: 1. Don't tell Lorraine you read a review about her service on here, say you saw her ad on Natural Therapy Pages and all you want is a "normal" massage. 2. Please don't show her this review. Thanks].

Person's Name: Lorraine

Establishment: Private apartment in Zetland which is a 10 minute walk from Green Square Railway Station

Date of visit: January 2015

Contact details: 0450 242 938; Lorraine also only advertises "legitimately" on Natural Terapy Pages, here: Lorraine's Ka Huna Massage - Zetland - Lorraine - NaturalTherapyPages.com.au

Hours of business: Ring Lorraine

Rates: $100 for a one hour Kahuna massage (+$25 for a hand job)

Age: mid-to-late 30s

Size/shape: 5'4", shoulder length blonde hair, hazel eyes, C cup breasts, size 12

Ethnicity: Caucasian (perhaps European background)

Services provided: Kahuna massage, groping, hand job (perhaps more for the right price)

Value for money/recommend. The Kahuna massage is value for money. The extras provided and time allotted are not value for money.

My experience/comments: I came across Lorraine's ad on Natural Therapy Pages after looking for a Kahuna massage. Her ad only has a mobile number and no address - a good sign that perhaps maybe more could be on offer.

Lorraine was easy to get a hold of. Over the phone I asked if it was OK if I had the massage un-draped to which she replied "sure." The booking was simple to make and Lorraine text me her address.

I arrived at her relatively spacious clean and tidy apartment and was greeted by Lorraine. She was quite cute without being a glamour, and was wearing a summer dress. There is enough space in her living room to comfortably set up a massage table. I was offered a shower which I took and Lorraine provided a towel, soap, etc. This was all well done.

After getting out of the shower I jump onto the table face down. This is the traditional Kahuna massage (which I love) so there was no towel on the massage table and lots of oil was used. Her Kahuna massage is fantastic - one of the best I have ever had (Lorraine is definitely a qualified Kahuna practitioner).

Lorraine placed a folded sarong between my legs as I was lying on my stomach, but brushed it away within the first five minutes. I had pointed my cock directly down beneath my legs so she could see it, and there was plenty of 'accidental' touching, so I immediately thought to myself "you beauty, there are extras on offer here."

On the flip over Lorraine again placed a folded sarong over my cock, which was again brushed aside in five minutes. Plenty of accidental brushes occurred. I adjusted my cock and balls to which Lorraine replied "would you like me to take care of that." I asked how much it would be to which she replied $25. I told her I'm fine do you mind if I stroke myself, which she was fine with. Lorraine was very accommodating and kept telling me to relax and enjoy myself, and she also played with my cock and balls, eventually getting around to stroking me. I asked if she would mind if I touched her, to which she raised her dress to reveal no underwear, so I began to rub her pussy.

It was all very hot and intense, and after cumming Lorraine cleaned me with a wet towel. I asked for a shower which she said was fine. Getting out of the shower I thanked her and offered her $125 (even though I didn't ask her to stroke me - but whatever).

I left, jumped in the lift, look at my watch, and realise I was only there for 45 minutes (both shower times included). This pissed me off a little, but again, whatever.

Will I be back? No - I've ticked this off my list. However, I recommend Lorraine if you enjoy a Kahuna massage with a little bit more on offer.

Nice find Cartman

I am always interested in a nice massage. I have had many styles but never heard nor experienced  Kahuna massage. Can you elaborate what that consist of?

Hi Mad_Bastard - glad I could help!

The Kahuna massage (sometimes known as a Lomi Lomi or Hawaiian massage) involves lots of long flowing strokes above and below the body. There is no towel on the table which is why the therapist can get access to work under your body. I've found in my experience Kahuna massages really push the envelop between a normal and sensual massage (even from the strictly therapeutic practitioners).

I guess it is up to the individual whether or not $100 is worth it for a massage - personally it is worth it for me as I like the "thrill" of not knowing if I'll get anything more.

I'll provide a link of a Kahuna massage video below - hope this helps! (if not, feel free to ask me more questions).

Hahaha my pleasure Mad_Bastard! I've mentioned it a few times before (some may be getting sick of me mentioning it) but my punting budget isn't that large these days unfortunately, so I'm always happy to unearth a gem/something different for my bros in the AUXXX community.

Person's Name : Lorraine's Kahuna massage

Establishment : Private residence in Zetland

Date of Visit : 18/2/2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0450 242 938

Hours of Business : Various, ring for appt, say you saw advertisement in Natural Therapies on the net

Rates : $100 for 60 min

Age : mid 30's

Size/shape : short, around size 10-12

Nationality or Ethnicity : aussie

Services Provided :   Kahuna massage with lots of oil

Value for money/recommend? : The jury is still out on this one as my first visit did not include rub n tug

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)After reading Cartman's review i thought I would give this one a try. 
I rang Lorraine and made an appointment, she lives in a fairly modern and clean apartment in Zetland, finding it was no problem and neither was parking, when I arrived she asked if I have ever had a Kahuna massage before and I said yes, she didn't ask for money upfront and asked if I wanted a shower, I said that I had  just showered 30 min before arrival so that was no problem.
On with the massage, she uses lots of oil with a sarong draped over your bum when face down and just over the old fella when face up, massage was great with long flowing  strong strokes,she uses her elbows as well, but certainly no teasing involved,she does come slightly in contact accidentally with your privates above the sarong but not enough teasing to get you really worked up.
Unfortunately for me the  folded sarong stayed in place so there was no real contact  downunder, although she could see I was enjoing it but alas she didn't offer any extras and I didn't ask, maybe I should have.
Would I return?, probably give it another go as the massage was great and perhaps circumstances next time might include a HJ, a bit of relief would have topped it off though.
I suppose that's the chance you take when you go to a legit massage hoping for a little extra, sometimes you may get it sometimes not.

just to add to this one same for me as trapper.  I called in today.  Good massage accidental brushing sarong remained in place and no offer made to me either despite raging boner.  I took care of thing post massage in the shower.

She must be wondering why the sudden in flux in work!

I probably will give it one more go but if no tug then I think a bit $$$ for just a massage (as good as it is).

So, I finally got to see her this weekend. Wanted to take a change from the regular Thai and Chinese massage I normally go to

First impressions....she was a bit older than I thought she was. Probably mid 40's I reckon and a lot more petite. She was not dressed in a sexy sarong but in pants and jacket (it was a cold day) but she did get down to a T shirt during the massage. The table also had a towel on it which I laid on top off. I did ask about that as the real Lomi Lomi massage does without that but she said it there it was because it was a cold day.

Anyway, she asked me if I had a Lomi Lomi massage before and I said I did once in Paddington many years ago. She said she goes there too!! Also asked how I knew about her and I said that my friend Bert told me about her. She looked puzzled and said she has no idea who he was...haha!

I had a shower and came out naked and laid face down on the table. She then put a couple of towels on me and with heaps of oil started a nice pushing type massage with long flows. It certainly felt nice and there was good pressure as she worked my back. She doesn't quite have enough strength to get her arms under you which a true Lomi Lomi massage would normally encompass. She would move the towels aside and worked my ass and legs and a few times her hands and fingers would make contact with junior but not enough to get him too excited. Then it was time to flip over and she massages my chest standing at the head of the table which meant that her chest was over my face. I was half tempted to move my head up to nuzzle her tits but hard to make out as she had a baggy T shirt on. More inside leg massage and junior was now getting excited and a couple of accidental touches made me think more would be offered.....but alas, nothing seemed forthcoming. As I sensed the massage was coming to an end - I summoned some bravery and asked if it was OK for me to stroke myself. She was a caught a bit off guard but said to go ahead. Poured some oil on junior and I started a slow wank. She was still massaging my legs and my belly as this was going on. Now, I was really surprised she didn't help out here but allowed me to go on, I eventually shot a load off on my belly. Wiped me clean and she asked me if I had felt horny during the massage. I said of course...and she laughed!!

Finished off the massage and had a hot shower to wash off the oil and gave her the $100. She was very keen for me to come back to see her....but I am not sure if I will. For $100, I could get a lot more. But one ticked off the bucket list

Hi folks,

I don't believe there is a need for me to post a full review as it would add nothing to what I've already posted in this thread. However, I just thought I would let you all know the following facts about Lorraine:

1. I visited Lorraine a fortnight ago.
2. Price was the same.
3. Lorraine offered a hand-job and playing with her breasts.
4. Even to regulars (i.e., me) she can be moody on the phone. But in real-life she is fine and pleasant.

Cheers.

Long story short, this therapist: The Kahuna Lounge - Rosebay - NaturalTherapyPages.com.au provides a great Kahuna massage. However, you DEFINITELY WILL NOT get any extras and DEFINITELY WILL NOT be allowed to touch yourself (she provides an excellent massage, though).

 Lorraine's Ka Huna Massage Zetland 0450242938
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name: Lorraine

 Establishment: Private apartment in Zetland ,there is parking for 2 hours in the shopping precinct @ Green Square

 Date of visit: OCT 2015

 Contact details: 0450 242 938; Lorraine's Ka Huna Massage - Zetland - Lorraine - NaturalTherapyPages.com.au

 Hours of business: Ring Lorraine Wed-Sun,I think.

 Rates: $100 for a one hour Kahuna massage.

 Age: mid-to-late 30s

 Size/shape: 5'4", shoulder length blonde hair, hazel eyes, C cup breasts,small

 Ethnicity: Caucasian

 Services provided: Kahuna massage.

 Value for money/recommend. The Kahuna massage is value for money. 

 My experience/comments: 
I came across Lorraine's info on here and tried texting her but no reply so booked one of my regular ML's.It was on the drive there that I received a call from Lorraine asking me if I could come over but it was too late so arranged a booking for the following day.
Made my way to Zetland via Campbelltown with plenty of time so as I thought parking might be a problem in a place I wasn't familar with.Took about half a hour doing repeat circuits before finding a spot and it was a short walk in 36 degree heat.So much for showering before I left.
I rang and she buzzed me up to her appartment and in I went.She is quite tidy but very friendly and easy to talk to.Got the question about where did I hear about her and just answered that I had googled as I was trying different styles of massage until I find the one that suits me.
I took the offer of a shower and was warned about drainage problem if I splashed around too much.Everything clean and presentable although a little cluttered in the lounge where the massage table was set up.Now what would be my strategy to acquire any extras?I know I'll walk out of the shower to the table naked and available.Then I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and thought she might be the one to walk even though it was her appartment.Still I'm sure she seen it all before.
I clambered onto the table and pointed the old turnip south and waited in anticipation for the Ka Huna massage to begin.I thought I wouldn't push anything or even ask(I don't ask now ever since I was refused and became so embarassed)Just go with the flow and enjoy.
I must say the massage was very good and there was the occasional knock on the doorbells and on the turnover thought that I might rise to the occasion and see how she deals with that.But alas I didn't get an erection and I think it was partly because I was desperate for a piss having drank litres of water before,due to the hot day.A lot of the front massage was around my chest and belly and it was getting painful in my bladder.I should have said something,so my fault there.
So the massage ends and we have chat about things I mentioned I really liked Tantric massage of which she replied so did she.I should have pretended I could do it and might have got free fiddle of the flaps,lol.
The massage was very relaxing and I would go back and maybe with a different strategy but it's not the be all and end all if I don't get an extra.
I have started recently going to two  places in the same area on the same day.One a new ml/mp and another which I know can deliver the extra as a back up.I did notice that close to Lorraine's was Good Fortune massage which I've not been to but has some good reviews on this forum,so it will be my back up place next time at Lorraine's.
One thing to add is take the offer of a shower after Lorraine's massage as she uses organic coconut oil and you won't be able to hide the aroma from your clothes.That would a bugger if you was caught out without actually doing anything.

Very good review sandsifter, you explained a lot about her massage and her place which is all correct. I ended up booking and seeing Lorraine a couple of months ago. Nothing to add to the reviews that have already been post except that she had noticed my extremely hard member on turn over and after some sighing from me asked if I was frustrated and needed to play with myself as I could...I then said that I'd prefer if she did it and she obliged but said it would be extra.

Am keen to go back eventually Now she knows I like that kind of ending, I'm wondering if my hands can explore like Cartman's could.

I contacted her by SMS in the latter part of last year, on the basis of her ad in the therapeutic massage section of Cracker, which did not give her location.  She responded and gave me the details.  After some ping-pong I decided not to make an appointment as her location is quite far from me.  She did seem quite keen for me to come, but accepted reason for not making an appointment after I told her I was on the Upper North Shore.

I have a feeling that her Cracker ad said that she operated only on a couple of days a week.  In any case her ad soon disappeared from Cracker, no doubt because she did not want to be associated with all the R&Ts that fill that category.  Her ad was relegated to very end of the ads for the current day, which is where the genuine ads usually end up.  It may be that she was deluged with calls from men who assumed that she offered R&T, which I very much doubt she does.

It may well be that she no longer operates.

I read back through this thread.  Six members stated that they had received a massage from her, of which two stated that they had been offered a handjob, one started that he had been allowed to DIY only, and three stated that they had not been offered a handjob and that there was no sexual touching on her part.

It seems that the intel about Lorraine is quite contradictory.  If she charges for the handjob, there would seem to be no reason why she would not offer it to get some extra income.

Since I have not been to her myself, I cannot know what is the reality with regard to this lady.  My understanding always was that massage therapists who advertise on Naturaltherapypages have to be legit.  Anyway, some time when I am in Sydney again I will try to see her (assuming she is still operating).  I have had Kahuna massages before, most legit and only two with a handjob, and I have enjoyed them, both with and without.  $100 per hour seems to be the going rate.

Given that you admit you have not even seen Lorraine, one wonders why you brought it up and continue to argue like this. You may remember back in earlier time we went to lots of "massage shops" which had acupuncture diagrams on the wall and large signs "Massage Only". Such signs had no influence of the services available.
Look in the local rages under massage and some but not all of these places that advertise there also provide additional service.

You seem to have great difficulty in understanding "Your Mileage May Vary" (YMMV) based on individual interactions, likes, dislikes etc of people.
You seem to be the only punter that appears to have this difficulty, can you explain why this is so?

I sincerely hope that the reality about Lorraine is as Cartman described it in his initial review.  But the negative experiences of a number of others who tried her massage were a bit depressing.

As for reviews, I bought silver membership only a few days ago, and have not had a massage in the interim.  Being in my late 60s I do not often go for a massage, and when I do it is mainly out of nostalgia than because of any pressing physical need.  My comments about various ladies, which I hope have been informative in the main, have largely been based on past experience, although those about Charlotte in Seven Hills and Kristina in Hornsby related to visits I made last year.

If in the near future I visit a masseuse who has not been reviewed here, I will post a review.  There is one I have been visiting off and on since the late 1990s, and who I think has not been reviewed here, so next time I see her I will post a review.  But she is actually older than I am, so will you be interested?

According to her entry on Natural Therapy Pages, she is available only on Thursdays 10-7.  However, I do not know how up to date that entry is.

Lorraine's Kahuna Massage - Zetland, Waterloo, Redfern, Alexandria, Newtown, Randwick, Bondi, Coogee, Eastern Sububs NSW, Sydney - Lorraine - Lorraine's Ka Huna Massage - NaturalTherapyPages.com.au

I know of one kahuna masseuse who advised all her clients by email that she was ceasing operation, but her entry is still on Natural Therapy Pages.

Has anybody seen this lady recently?  The reason I ask is that a few months ago I had a rather confusing exchange of emails and phone messages with her that left me extremely puzzled.

Shortly after I moved to Sydney, I looked up Lorraine's ad on Natural Therapy Pages, and sent her a message via the enquiry function on her page, asking for details of the massage, such as price and hours of operation.  For a few days there was no reply, then suddenly I got a brief email from her, just stating that her massage was relaxation style and she worked only on Thursdays.  That response was encouraging, since reviews of her in this thread indicate that she did give a hand-job, at least to some clients.

I immediately emailed back, saying that a full-body relaxation massage was precisely what I was after, again asking about the price, and saying that I presumed that since she only worked one day in the week I would have to make an appointment well in advance.  Again several days passed without a reply, and I wondered whether my reference to "full body" had put her off, assuming that she only did straight kahuna.

However, a few days later, I found a message from her on my phone, to the effect that she was fully booked for the coming Thursday, but inviting me to make an appointment for the Thursday of the following week.  I immediately telephoned back, but only got a recorded message, so I sent off an email saying that I would like to make an appointment for that Thursday, but asking if I could make it provisional, subject to later confirmation, since I could not be sure how I would be placed over a week in the future.

By the next day there had been no response from her, so I telephoned again.  This time she answered, so I referred to the message she had left on my phone and to my emailed response, and confirmed that I would like to have the appointment on the day she had specified.  To my amazement, she said that she would be unable to give me an appointment since she was getting ready to go overseas! I asked if she would be coming back, and she replied that it would not be for a very long time; however, she would send me the number of someone who could give me a kahuna massage.

I was absolutely flabbergasted. On one day she is inviting me to make an appointment for a day over a week away, and on the very next day she is saying she will be unavailable because she is going overseas.  Can such a change of circumstances occur in just one day?

I think it most likely that she had simply changed her mind, that she no longer wanted to see me, and that the story about going overseas and not coming back for a long time was simply a ruse to get rid of me and make sure I did not try to contact her again.  Perhaps my asking for a provisional appointment had made her think I was just stuffing her around.

In the event, a text from her arrived giving a phone number, which turned out to be that of the Sydney Kahuna Centre, a totally legit place so far as I know.  I assume her referring me to a legit kahuna place was a way of conveying the message that she too was legit.

All in all it was a mystifying experience, and that is why I am asking if anyone has seen her recently, someone who could confirm how she is operating now.

I haven't seen her since my last review, but can confirm she is getting sloppy with her correspondence to clients (i.e., I've text her a few times over the past year to make a booking and sometimes she would respond, other times not - so I never ended up going ahead with the booking).

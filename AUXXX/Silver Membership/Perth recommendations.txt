 Perth recommendations
				
Post Content: 
Hi all,

I'll be in Perth for work next week and looking for suggestions to try.

I was there last week and responded to a few backpage ads and they all turned out to be fake photos so was left very disappointed. The girls themselves were nothing special so not worth doing a review to give them awareness.

Thanks in advance.

Good luck with your punting in Perth. Hopefully our WA members can line you up a decent punt or two.

Just a point about posting reviews of "not so special punts"...It is just as useful to our members to post reviews of disappointing and dud punts to let us  know who to avoid, and the reasons we should give them a miss. Remember, one mans meat is another mans poison and vice versa.
The more information we have (good and bad) helps us make better choices.

I don't have the ads or numbers on hand, but there's a pattern of them replying on a different number.

Addresses to avoid are 145 Newcastle St, Northbridge. Morley Dr, Dianella and one in an empty apartment in Rivervale.

All claimed to be Japanese or Korean yet were all chinese and nothing like the advertised photos.

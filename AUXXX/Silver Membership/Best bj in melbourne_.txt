 Best bj in melbourne?
				
Post Content: 
Simple really where is it? Can anyone nominate the best bj in melbourne. Barbara from east malvern is good and of course the rimming always helps and the fact that she doesn't flinch when its time to empty the pipes. However im sure we are all a fan of this so lets help each other out. Can be in rnt or full service parlors. I'm just interested in trying a few out.
Cheers

Hi tbone,

Call me crazy, but a bj does not work for me (I mean it does but its not my first "turn on" if you know what I mean). I love going DATY and FS and other things. So hence, I did stop by your post, but sorry, not much more I can add. I have had a few ML's try on me, but it take a long time and in the end they give in and just jump on board for the ride instead so they enjoy as well!!
Hope the other guys can give some feedback :-)

I've noticed there's a 'Simply Bliss' industry member on the forum who often seems to be online so maybe you could PM her to check if she's still in service or retired.  (I thought it was a shop!)

Yeah, its very funny. When I was a young guy, I loved it when a woman/girlfriends gave me a BBBJ. My first sexual encounter was a BBBJ in the car and it just knocked me socks off!! Turned my legs to jelly. But now, I still enjoy it but its not my first port of call. Don't ask me why...

I guess I don't have a strong contender - Veronica is good but shoves her finger up your arse which ruins the mood for me. (In fact last time I asked her to finish me with her hand and have her tongue up my arse - much better!)
I have been meaning to try barbara for a long time but haven't got around to it. And if Justa says Sexy Leeza is worth a try that's good enough for me!

Leeza has amazing blow job skills but she is on the bigger side and charges big too

Now I love a bj, I'd almost prefer it over fs as I can just relax and enjoy the slow build up. Unfortunately being relatively new to punting, I can't add much yet. 
Cindy at clayton gave me a pretty good bbbj last week, no cim though.

Probably the best for me are:

3: Suki from Romantics (a bit aggressive with some teeth)
2: Portia from Candy Club (veteran)
1: Poa/Boa from Tender Touch back in 2008-2009 (similar to Portia)

One other I have to mention was Kim from Giallo Colias, the Korean. $200.00 for a BBBJ but it was worth it. Even let me COF and CIM with a smile.

But from experience, I think any girl if they like you enough will give you a pretty decent BBBJ. Used to see a girl once at Candy Club, she's gone now if anyone wants to ask. She'd start off a bit slow, then everytime I made her cum she sucks like a machine.

Other times I get stories from girls where they say some men don't clean their dicks, which is pretty yuck.

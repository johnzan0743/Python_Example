 What's your escape plan like?
				
Post Content: 
The other day I booked an escort from Melbourne Backpages 만나서 반가워 University Naughty ~Girl Sexy lovely Available Today - 22 and was promised that the girl in the picture was "100% Real". 

Obviously it wasn't and it turned out she looked more of a ladyboy with a plastic nose than anything. That in turn made a very awkward conversation in the apartment into why I didn't want to have sex with her/him. It looked like that had just shaved their upper lip mustache. She/He even offered me Anal and COF for $200 for the hour to keep me from walking.

In the end my excuse was "I'm too focused on the lady in the picture to have sex with you", and for half the day I had non-stop abusive texts from her/him.

I usually use the card trick to get out of sticky situations. Was wondering what others had up their sleeve.

I would be blunt too.  You've already fucked me, no way I'm fucking you. While I can understand and tolerate a WL who displays glamour photos of herself in her adverts and doesn't turn out to be quite as glamorous on the day I see her (bit like a perfect juicy Big Mac in a Macca's commercial), I abhor blatant deception.  Luckily it hasn't happened to me yet.

Also a good example why a punting phone is handy.  Just turn it off, and poof! no more abuse (at least until you turn it on again a few days later anyway).

Yeah in any other case where the WL wasn't who she said she would be I would've countered with a no, or shown the picture to her face. Got thrown a curveball that day with a lookalike tranny, so didn't know how to hit that out of the park....

Usually I have a back up plan with a different escort or a regular shop, but man, never had a girl look so much like a dude...

I think most adult men and especially seasoned punters can make a very quick decision within the first 5 seconds upon meeting the WL - to fuck or not to fuck !

And if you can't make up you mind or a borderline, then it's a no too !!

So, when she opens the door , you say hi, then decide ! Don't even go inside if you don't immediately wanted to fuck her !

Oh dear, the ol' bait and switch trick!
Ok, this is the best strategy to save you.

When she opens the door (and you realise she's a horror story), immediately cry out, 
"THE LORD WILL SAVE YOU!" 
then drop to your knees and ask her to join you in prayer.
I GUARANTEE she'll want to pay YOU just to leave!

Visited a motel in Brissy where I expected to find a cute Japanese girl called 'creamy' (from Backpage). The door opened and there stood a 40+ filipino with all the hour-glass shape of a wombat! Stupid me went through with the booking, but could barely raise it. Cursed and swore all the way home - 'Never again!' I will definitely immediately walk next time if it isn't the same girl!

If the door opened and she was a different wl to the ad, and I didn't want to fuck her, I'd have no hesitation in saying so and walking

Ive walked from a few of them (all Asian) when they have blatantly lied in an ad, or had fake pics. I hate it when they hide behind the door until you are well in the apartment. I just tell them they are not what they say they are, or not what I saw in the photos. Some get real angry and start yapping in their language, some plead for you to stay.
me, personally, I dont give a shit what they say. They conned me and wasted my time, im walking

Gentlemen I have to say in a WLadies defense, I too hid behind the door Hill Rd was a very busy street with neighbors across the road and Surry Hills was a busy complex so there is no way I could open the door right up.
Yes I personally lied about my age but I don't look anywhere near my age and once I had seen a client if they asked I would tell them. Most of them were shocked and I have always maintained in not a slim lady. However if you want Bbj with cim then I can honestly say no one way ever dissatisfied.
Not to my knowledge anyway. The only time thinfs didn't go that well if the click wasn't there.

I have no trouble walking if the WL isn't up to scratch. Done it a number of times. Particularly with asian lasses. Some of them are never what is advertised. They have a tempting description, to get the punter to the door and hope he's just too interested in just getting a shot away and won't worry that the product is not what was advertised. Once I knocked on a door expecting to find an attractive mid 20's blonde, size 10 Aussie chick (as per her ad in CTimes) and the door opened it was a late 30's, drug addicted shocker. She had dirty hair, her flat stunk from the front door, she looked like she had just got out of bed and had teeth missing and all.....I said something like....youve got to be joking, to her face and turned and walked. I'd rather have a wank than spend my hard earned on some shitter like that.

For private escort situations, I carry and wear a "Termite & Pest Control" polo shirt, which a punting mate suggested and gave to me a while back ago.
This way if the WL is a complete scrubber I can wing it and come up with the excuse that I am there to fumigate the joint.

Obviously it's best to go to reliable reputable places to start with but we all like adventure from time to time.

One easy escape plan is just before you knock on the door set the alarm on your phone to go off with a normal ring tone in 2 minutes time and make sure you don't pay before the alarm goes off by making small talk.  That way if you don't like the girl just answer the alarm on your phone as if you have an important call and you need to leave immediately due to an emergency back at work or to your brother etc and apologise on the way out saying you'll come back another time soon.  It will work every time.

Yep. Works real good until the phone 'really' rings while you're having a fake conversation. So make sure you turn the ring off  Lol

Oh how technology can fuck you over sometimes.

That problem was discovered during test phase 3.  Fortunately there is a solution.  Turn the phone to silent meaning the alarm will still go off as normal but any inbound calls after that won't be heard.

Just put your money in a different pocket from your wallet.
If you don't like the look of her you still pull out your wallet and go 'oh shit I left my money in the car'. Or just leave you wallet in the car full stop and only bring cash but pretend you forgot your wallet.

She is not going to shag you if you can't pay

It's your money. You want to root a pigdog then it's up to you. No one has a gun to your head saying "fuck that mole!" 

Plenty a time when I check the ads and see Beauty, but when I turn up it's Beast. I just say "Sorry, not what I was after" and turn tail, looking for something else to satisfy the urge.

You're the customer. Shouldn't be pressured to do something you don't want. That's what ex-wives/gf's/battleaxes are for.

 Private investigators used to visit rnt's for evidence
				
Post Content: 
Since the councils gave up trying to close illegal rnt's and the police have taken over that role, there was a day when councils would employ private investigators to have sexual relations at rnt's to gain evidence for a prosecution.  Can u imagine a married investigator having sex with a massage lady. Can u imagine him going down on her saying things like " umm yeah, you like that" .  Would the private investigator have developed an addiction to what he was doing and maybe he secretly enjoyed it.  I wonder how the police go about gaining evidence now with the chardonnay rnt shops.  When i read that private investigators were being used to gain evidence, i believed that would put an end to rnt's, but it seems the industry has overwhelmed the authorities, in the same way thousands of people would overwhelm a man, trying to shoot them all down with a limited amount of bullets.

The old style rnt's run out of private homes are all but dead.  I wonder if the new style rnt's with there billboards are run by the same old school managers who have adhered to a newer billboard advertising way, or the new shops are run by a totally different crew who have no idea of the old school rnt ways.

When one of the investigation companies not long ago advertised for investigators for this exact role they specifically asked for single investigators.  What a fucking awesome job.

if i was a single private investigator, i would be playing a very submissive role, knowing what i know, it would be so much fun.  Pretending you are being seduced, using my stock standard lines like"no no we must'nt please stop " lol.

Would they actually go all the way and have sex or stop before consummation once the ML had incriminated herself by offering/agreeing to it?  I can understand the rationale for perhaps starting the hanky-panky (so they've got incontrovertible evidence as to what is happening), but cannot see how they could justify continuing to completion.  Nice work if you can get it though.

You cannot see the justification? 

They need hard evidence of course.

I have read quite a few reports in Victoria. They are quite detailed except the investigator always says they never removed the underwear and they were offered a service, and just as the act would commence they would get up and decide to leave.

There are other reports that said nothing happened, even though it occurred in well known places.

If investigators do the act, they have broken the law and liable for prosecution.

That's what I was wondering, didn't think they'd have immunity to get their rocks off just because they were 'on the job'.  An extreme analogy would be an undercover cop who's infiltrated an OMCG offing a bikie from a rival club in order to maintain his cover.  Pretty sure they aren't allowed to do that either.

What law has the investigator broken?

I think this is a big problem with undercover police as well just sort of falling into the lifestyle. I heard about a friend of a friend who was an undercover police officer and got into trouble doing something while he was undercover. He had to leave the police force apparently but wasn't bad enough to be prosecuted or anything.

Interesting topic though.

Not entirely sure they would have broken the law. The Victorian Sex Work Act says:





15 Being in, entering or leaving unlicensed brothel 
A person must not be found, without reasonable 
excuse, in or entering or leaving a brothel in 
respect of which there is not in force any licence 
required under Part 3. 
			
		

If the Private Investigator is licensed (or registered or whatever ...) and has been contracted by Council to obtain evidence, that is probably a "reasonable excuse".

In NSW, the laws are a bit looser and more vague. It appears from my reading of them that the only crime that the punter commits in a R&T (a non DA approved one) is asking for a sexual service - even so much as a tug. In another thread Hard posted a link to a recent NSW Land and Environment Court judgement. This part of the judgement has some relevance to this thread:





			
				In this case, the Council, through the evidence of its Development Enforcement Officer, Steven Balafas, and a Private Investigator, Adam Gage, has clearly demonstrated the provision in the premises of sexual services for money (to Gage on 3 and 22 October 2013), and the advertisement of such services by signage, internet etc, from at least February 2013, until at least February 2014.

So is the punter technically breaking the law if he doesn't ask for a tug but merely accepts one if it is offered to him? 

("Your Honour, I simply had no idea the establishment in question was a house of ill-repute.  In my innocence, I only patronised it to seek some much needed treatment for my aching bones and back.  When the young therapist -- whom I now recognise as the harlot and Jezebel that she is -- offered to provide me with some 'hand relief', I assumed -- foolishly, it would now seem -- that it was merely part of an ancient remedy from the mysterious East that would ease my suffering, and therefore I duly complied with her suggestion.  Had I known the reality of the situation...  Hmm, what's that, your Honour? ... Yes, I'll shut up now." )

That is how I read it - however I am not a lawyer, so I may be totally wrong. But this is one of those things that is only illegal if you get caught and I have a very strong suspicion that in the Chinese R&Ts I have being visiting of late, the arrival of Plod or Council Goons will be announced very loudly in Chinese by Mamasan to give a chance for a hasty "legitimising" of proceedings in the rooms.

The actual section of the Summary Offences Act is (I think soliciting means asking ...):





16   Prostitution or soliciting in massage parlours etc

A person shall not use, for the purpose of prostitution or of soliciting for prostitution, any premises held out as being available:
(a)  for the provision of massage, sauna baths, steam baths or facilities for physical exercise, or
(b)  for the taking of photographs, or
(c)  as a photographic studio,
or for services of a like nature.
Maximum penalty: 5 penalty units or imprisonment for 3 months.

I may be totally wrong as well, but I suspect in this context soliciting means offering -- i.e. the shop/ML offering prostitution, so the offence against the above section would be committed by them rather than the punter.

Anyway, I think I'll continue to stick to the legal (if overpriced) joints.  No point in adding legal anxiety to performance  anxiety.

That is a common misconception The illegal places are not necessarily cheaper than the legal ones. By way of example, my usual Friday (illegal) haunt costs me exactly the same as any number of legal establishments - but the lady gets a bigger share of the takings. Indeed, if not for this particular lady, I would not visit that establishment (its a bit  far from home). Tomorrow afternoon, I intend to visit another place without the appropriate paperwork. Depending on which lady I see (and how "friendly" she decides to be) that could well cost me $20 more than the fully approved place I drive past on the way.

This is something that a real lawyer can help to explain. But I don't need one (yet ). I also never ask ....

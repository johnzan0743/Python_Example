 Is Massage Alone Losing its Value as a Punting Experience?

What do you guys think?

Not sure about prices in other states (I don't read the reviews other than NSW to be honest) in Sydney the standard price for extras at a rub-n-tug shop is generally $20 for a HJ and $50 for a HJ including nude and sometimes "body slide".

In a half hour massage, which is normally about $35 in most of the Asian shops here, add on $50 and the total price is $85.

Considering you can often get excellent service in the form of sex, DATY, BBJ and maybe a little massage at the end when visiting a full service brothel, are massage shops starting to lose their value/appeal?

Quite often the "body-to-body" a girl says she'll do for you is her just rubbing her tits on your back and quite often they shy away from you even getting close to putting your fingers anywhere near their pussy. 

Sure, sometimes it's nice just to be lazy and have a good massage with a happy ending as a bonus (and for $55 inclusive I think that's still good value), but if I'm looking for a sexy experience rather than a therapeutic one I think the brothels offer far better value - especially considering what you're NOT allowed to do with your massage girl for the "$50 nude option" seems to get longer with each passing day.

What's your opinion, guys?

i think so. when the rnt price structure was based around brothel prices it was great, but now the rnt industry has set obscene prices for extras so brothels are the way to go .

I'm not sure that things have changed. I indulge in a mix of massage, extras and FS punting and have seen no particular price movement or value change in any sector in the last 4-5 years.

A high-quality massage with a simple (fully clothed) tug at the end is enjoyable but so is the challenge of any possible upsell for extra that's on offer.

It's true that some B2B experiences can be underwhelming. However, that may be where regular attendance builds trust and so, extra 'benefits'... 

On the other hand, for the assurance of FS, it's a brothel. Probably just depends on the day...!

Maybe I should have put it in my original post (too late to edit it now) but yeah - the "thrill of the hunt" used to be great in RnT places and it was quite common that $50 would get you a lot of extras! 

Nowadays I'm finding that there's less and less extras on offer at RnT shops and $50 will buy you a "massage", view of a naked lady and a pair of boobs lacklustredly rubbing on your back. I think the reviews of RnT places are showing that too - less extras on offer as time goes by. Maybe I'm going to the wrong massage shops. LOL.
Of couse, as you said, Hard... regular attendance does build up a level of trust, but you have to invest more $$'s over a few visits without guaranteed return. 

But yeah - agree that the mood you're in makes a difference. As I said, sometimes it's nice just to lie there and let it all happen.

This topic has been brought up numerous times and every possible angles, I am sure has been fully and thoroughly discussed or debated. At the end of the day, it's totally a personal choice IMHO !

To start with, I think the FS and MS are two separate industry and body/mind experiences. And as I always say, if you want FS, you go to a FS shop, they have their own rules and price structures and a range of services and products that will surely suit most people's tastes and desires.

There are people (probably more for matured married men - like yours truly here!) who really enjoy a good massage and a release at the end, it's a life style rather than a sexual encounter - of course, as more extras and higher tipping is involved, that becomes a grey area !!

It's a whole lot of mental and psychological thing when it comes to why many of the punters rather have a RnT vs FS when the cost is almost the same, there could be hundreds of reasons, but I may just drop a few here, most of them personal experiences:

1. For married men, a RnT is NOT cheating on his wife or partner or girl friend, yes, I know, it's like hiding your head in the sand, but I for one think like that...........lol. If you walk into a FS, your intend is to fuck and to have sex with another woman, but when you walk into a massage shop, you are having a massage, a HJ is really NOT sex, right ?..............haha, and then if one thing lead to the next...............well, that's a different story.

2. With MS popping up everywhere in Sydney, walking into a massage shop is no big deal, while walking into a FS shop, what sort of excuses can you come up with if you are caught.

3. Location and convenience for a quickie: this could be the most important and dominant reasons, how many RnT shops are there now in the CBD, or major city centres like North Sydney, Chatswood, Newtown, Bondi Junction etc. there is nearly a MS on every street and they are not hidden away in some industrial area like many FS shop, you can almost walk down to the TAB on a Saturday, place a bet, watch the races, and the time it took is enough time to go to a massage shop and have a quickie instead. And there could be NO FS shops near your area. 

And I am sure all the CBD working Brothers will agree that having a RnT joint within 5 min of your office is just GOLD !!

4. A performance issue ! this is a real and present danger, when you go FS, you need to get it up to fuck !! but when you go RnT, you don't have to do anything, just lay there and enjoy. 

5. A feeling that the massage girl is cleaner and fresher, her pussy is tighter because she doesn't have to fuck 12 people everyday, she only gives FS to very few regular clients (I am the only one..............lol, or at least I am the only one today !!) I don't think I need to elaborate here any more ..............haha

6. A feeling of hunt and conquest !! you don't have that feeling when you go FS, because, everyone walk in that door will get his cock sucked, and everyone walk in can fuck this girl within 5 min. you can't say that to a Massage girl, she may, she may not, how much will she charge, how many times you have to see her before she will suck your cock, and how many more times before your cock can be inside her pussy ?? the uncertainty, the hope and promises of more to come, the thrill of success.................you just can't buy these sort feeling at the FS shop.

7. There are probably a certain group of punters who just like to fuck massage girls, once they got it, they move on to other targets. It's almost like clubing and searching for a one night stand at the massage shop, need I say more ?

8................................

Just my 7 cents, got to go now !

Cheers

To me, this is the key difference between a FS shop and the massage experience. Two of my favourites work in massage shops. I get almost no massage from either of them - if you get my meaning. The price (including the extras) is much the same as a FS shop. Granted, the action takes place on (and around) a massage table, rather than on a nice comfortable bed, but that adds to the challenge.

It is also worth remembering that there are four tiers of massage (or R&T) establishments, all with different styles of service.

There are the basic $60 ph Chinese shops with the $20 for the tug or $50 for the kit off and tug, and more as negotiated
There are the Thai shops such as Pure Massage in North Sydney at around $120 ph, but the lady is nude for the entire session and the bodyslide is perhaps more satisfying - usually done with oil - and the places have showers.
The next price point is the Korean places - Romeos, Juliet, Midas, Masstige8 at about the $170 ph. A different experience again. The full pamper package. If you find the right lady there, this is wonderful. But too often, I have found it "mechanical" or "routine" - bereft of any "involvement". But this money is well and truly into FS territory.
At the high end there are the places like Bodyrotic, Mistys, the Michelles chain, Bliss and others (largely Caucasian). The price point here is around $250 ph. Extras are available in some, and I have see reports of FS being an extra $100 to $150 - which puts the total spend into Stiletto territory.

But these places are still in business. There have been new ones opened in each category in the last year or two. There seems to be a big enough market in each niche to keep them going. As with most things in this industry (or the wider world for that matter) - you pays your money, you takes your choice.

Of course Forums such as this one make it easier for the punter to make an informed choice.

Me - of late I have been almost making a point of visiting the Massage  shops as often as I can, perhaps as a "civil disobedience" statement about the stupidity of the NSW laws, and the related campaigns in the media. That and the fact that a couple of the ladies at such shops treat me very well ...

My 2 bobs worth, alot of Caucs up in SE QLD basically offer RnT at full service prices, a few fellow QLDers can confirm this, for that reason alone I figure may as well go fuck some chick then just lay there for a half asses massage followed by a quick hand job. When girls are asking $150 for a RnT to me its just way to much. I do understand the reasons, alot of girls I know when I started punting I went RnT & alot said they could not do sex, and a couple of candid girls actually admitted this way there is minimal sexual contact they keep the gusy arms at length when massaging, exepct for a handjob at the end...... 

I do at times head to a couple of RnT shops that I still feel are ok value, a 1/2 decent massage with a HJ at the end is value for $70 - $80 max, once it hits $100 so many girls offer $100 FS its just not money well spent to me anyways.

Variety is the spice of life! At different times I feel like different things and, as has been pointed out, there is now wide variety all at their different price points. Surely this can only be a good thing?

The market will dictate in the end.  As long as punters are prepared to pay $85 for a half hour nude R+T the shops will keep going.  It is only when the competition hots up that the price will drop or the service level increase.  If the pollies or the feminists succeed in closing down shops, the price will go up.  
However, there is something in the theory that somehow the ML is only doing FS cos you are handsome, and might actually enjoy the experience.  Maybe we should add add a "Fun"rating to reviews.  If the lady is just providing a body for you to get your rocks off, the fun rating would be 1.  If she really seems to enjoy the action and is a real GF experience, then the rating is 10.  Comments?

Excellent summations brother EG,

I can not agree more !!

Funny how things have changed in the past 20 years, I started my RnT journey way back when At Michelles started at 29 Newland st Bondi Junction and Misty was working for Michelle or rather for her ownself at room 501 (not to be confused with the Newtown shop at 501 King St..................haha), then they splitted and Michelle took up half of level 5 while Misty took the other half floor - those were the days !!

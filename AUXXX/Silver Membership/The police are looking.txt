 The police are looking
				
Post Content: 
Couple of days back I was told by a Melbourne CBD massage shop owner that the police paid her a visit late last week. They were interested in what massage services were on offer and wanted to speak with the girls. The police gave the owner a warning and said they sourced their information from the International Sex Guide. The specific section that includes Melbourne massage shops is here:

Melbourne

Totally public and easy to access with plenty of details about girls and services offered. Within a couple of days of something being posted about the shop in question some plain clothes police made a visit. They warned the owner that if further reviews appear that they'll get a warrant and do a full raid on the shop and turn it upside down. Clothed and nude hj's seemed the most that were on offer according to the reviews. They owner is now more than a little worried. 

My point is this reinforces that we need to be careful about what we post and where about massage shops. At least this site seems secure from the police. But the International Sex Guide section that includes Melbourne massage shops is not. Its total open access. And the police are looking...

Thanks for the tip Rnt Jimmy. I thought things had quietened down on the law enforcement visiting front since the change of state government but maybe not. 

ISG is pretty much open slather when it comes to info. And you don't even have to log in to read the forum.

Can you divulge what shop it was that had a visit? PM if you want.

Make no mistake, Plod (both official and self-appointed) is looking. There have been direct quotes from this forum and others in the media. Willoughby Council (in Sydney) was asked to allow some of its workers to be able to bypass the Council's Net Nanny and visit what some would consider "offensive websites" (such as this one). There was an item on The Feed on SBS2 last year about Chris Seage and his campaign to close "illegal" brothels. In that, they showed Mr Seage looking at forums (Punter Planet and Parlour Pages). They also showed some of the documents he prepared. This Forum's name was visible.

Of course, this relates to Sydney, but I would be very surprised if Plod in Victoria are not at least as active.

Spot on Evil. This threat shouldn't be taken lightly. I for one wouldn't want to get caught up in a raid. Be good for people to share useful info in this fairly sheltered (I assume) part of the forum.

I was really surprised when I found out. I didn't actually think the police would be that determined (its not like this shop if offering fs, bj or bbbj as extras). I've got to know the owner of the place after some regular visits to Melbourne over the past couple of years. Given that she told me the info in confidence I'm reluctant to disclose directly here where it is. Plus what I'm really wanting to highlight is the issue and to be aware of the potential determination of the police, rather than a particular massage shop. This could happen to any shop if actual details about massage 'services' available becomes open access and potentially public knowledge on the web.

I guess with all these increase in random pop ups of massage parlours within the last few years, I wouldn't that be surprised that the police started snooping around a lot more.

I was at The Elgar shop a few years back, and as I was waiting, there was a knock on the door. The mamasan opened up and this kid who was not much older than 12 asked if he can get a gf. I really couldn't believe it.

If kids like that know what the shops are up to, the cops are sure to know, they just need a smoking gun.

That's one of my worst fears, getting caught in the middle of a session.

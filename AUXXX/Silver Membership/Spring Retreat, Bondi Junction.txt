 Spring Retreat, Bondi Junction
				
Post Content: 
I wonder if there is any intel about this place which opened only at the end of November last year:

https://www.springretreat.com.au/

Some of the wording on this website sounds rather suggestive, eg "our mission is simple - to pamper your every need and create an exceptional relaxation experience that exceeds your expectations", or "massage therapy for your deepest therapeutic experience".

On the other hand there is nothing explicit, and I know that places that are totally legit sometimes use suggestive language to attract hopeful customers.

This place also advertises on Gumtree, which generally suggests legitimacy:    https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/bond...apy/1169297346 .  (This ad has changed; when it first appeared it featured a rather new-age-looking lady).      

I am thinking of trying it out myself sometime, but it will not be for a while since Bondi Junction is a bit distant from my normal North Shore stamping ground.  If and when I do, I will certainly post a review.  However, in the meantime I am wondering if anyone else has heard anything about this place, or even visited it.

Amy: "Spring Retreat. Amy speaking. How may I help you?"
Cartman: "Hello Amy. My name is Cartman. I am interested in visiting your retreat."
Amy: "Sure. What time would you like to come in?"
Cartman: "Before I visit I just have a couple of questions please?"
Amy: "Sure. Go ahead."
Cartman: "Do you offer health fund rebates?"
Amy: "Who are you with?"
Cartman: "HCF."
Amy: "Yes you can claim health fund rebates with HCF."
Cartman: "When I visit is it okay if I have the massage done undraped please?"
Amy: "What's that?"
Cartman: "It means have the massage done with no towel covering me."
Amy: "Um, that shouldn't be a problem."
Cartman: "Thank you. I will let you know when I can visit."
Amy: "No problem. Thank you for your call."

So. Who knows? Anyways, it looks like a cool little place so I'll visit and report back soon...

Thanks for the intel, Cartman.  The fact that they offer health fund rebates suggests legitimacy, although I understand that there are some R&T operators who give receipts that are supposedly claimable, eg Suzie Heath in Canberra.

Anyway, I will be interested to hear your report.

Its legit as far i know. I went there before it changed to this owner but i have had massages from 2 of the current therapists. Maria from Allys worked there as well and said they would get fired if they were found be doing extras. Another girl i saw privately before working here and would not allow going nude and undraped. 
The health fund rebates are suspect as the staff i know are not registered so would appear that the owner holds the health fund registration in the same way that Allys does health fund rebates. Their staff appear to be ovwrseas girls that are qualified in massage or physiotherapy. 

There has been a massage shop here for years and was previously a legit shop as well.

Thanks for the intel Wachumba.  I take it Maria is the black-haired girl who features in one of the photos on Spring Retreat's website and facebook page, sitting demurely on a massage table.  When she said she would be fired for doing extras, was that from Ally's or from her current job at Spring Retreat?

No, that is not her. The girl in the photo is a customer.

Maria said Spring Retreat would fire her if they gave extras. Obvious not at Allys as some of the girls there do extras.

"The girl in the photo is a customer."

It seems odd that a customer would consent to have her photo posted in this establishment's website and facebook page, let alone in such a suggestive pose. I have never come across that before.

It suggests to me that this place is aiming primarily at a female clientele. Could it be that it provides sexual services to female customers but not to  male ones?  I know for a fact, from information provided to me by women friends over the years, that that does happen at some places that are ostensibly legitimate.

its only on their website as their website shows their instagram feed. It is quite common on social media for business to post photos that models/girls have posted themselves. If you looked a little harder, you would have known that she was a customer. 

She's sitting on a massage bed fully clothed. How is this suggestive or odd?  Looks like conservative post compared to many others out that with girls being topless and/or g-strings so small they barely cover anything.

I guess one life adventures suggests that you get to see topless models if you take their tours  https://www.instagram.com/p/BcIrGXah...=natalie_roser

[Please note: No sexual services were offered in this session]

Person's name: Manon

Establishment: Spring Retreat - Bondi Junction

Date of visit: January 2018

Contact details/address/weblink: 02 8542 4414; 1/183 Oxford Street, Bondi Junction NSW 2022; https://www.springretreat.com.au/

Hours of business: 10:00am-7:00pm seven days a week

Rates: $80 for a one hour relaxation massage

Age: Early-20s

Size/shape: 5'8", dress size 8, C-cup breasts, long dark brunette hair, stunning face, super model physique. Dressed in tight white top and black tights

Nationality or ethnicity: French

Services provided: Relaxation massage

Value for money/recommend?: Yes/yes

My experience/comments: Dropped in here on short notice and entered the reception where a young Aussie guy, gorgeous blonde, and gorgeous brunette were seated behind the large counter. I would've been happy to be massaged by either the blonde or brunette.

Was given an iPad to fill out all my details (so be prepared to take about 5 minutes to do this before you go into the massage room). You select the music you'd like from a list of five different playlists. All very professional.

I hand the iPad back to the blonde and Manon, the brunette, instructs me to follow her into the massage room.

Into the room and she orders me to strip down and jump under the towel, and that she would be back in a minute. All the normal things that you would find in a massage room (i.e., towels, massage oil, etc) but no tissue box which told me this would be strictly legit. Nonetheless the room is schmick.

I popped a Viagra before I went and was rock hard with my dick pointing up and to the right when she walked back in. This was too obvious so I adjusted it so Manon couldn't see it and she got to work on my back.

An above average massage ensued. Back, arms, bum, etc. All draped and uncovered only one leg at a time (I didn't request undraped (this time around)).

Asked me to flip over and she held the towel up.

She uncovered only my left leg but got sort of close to my inner thigh. The Viagra naturally made me rock hard. It was a thrill pitching a tent in front of this gorgeous young woman in a totally legit situation. Onto the right leg and she (sort of, in my opinion) got a bit closer to my inner thigh (almost teasing, daring me to get rock hard again - which I of course did).

Onto the chest and arms (no abdominal massage) and that was that.

Was offered a glass of water, got dressed, met her out front (where the Aussie dude and blonde still were) and paid.

Will I be back: Yes. I think there are some great CFNM experiences to occur here. And $80 to be rubbed all over by a gorgeous young French woman (even if nothing sexual happens) is great value for money massage experience.

My point really is that I feel very uncomfortable about these discussions about extras in legit shops. I don’t think anyone ever posted the article which was in the media recently about changes to the law in Victoria designed to protect MLs in these shops from what they see as the predatory behaviour of some customers. Although it would be hard to bring charges obviously, they can call the police if a customer even asks for any sexual services. The threat of it, I am sure, would be enough to discourage most of us. These woman have taken the hard road of legit massages and that should be respected. Leave them alone. By the way, I haven’t always been perfect in this regard, but it is something I now feel strongly about.

#MeToo  I completely agree that genuinely non-sexual service providers should be respected and protected from lecherous clients who pester them for HR or more.

However, in Cartman's defence, I interpreted this review as a recce to confirm that this shop is indeed legit and, by his own account anyway (though I have no reason to doubt him at all), he did not ask for any extras or otherwise push the envelope, and there is no indication he made the ML uncomfortable. Popping a Viagra beforehand is probably the only thing that perhaps I would not have done, but I guess it's one way to bring up the subject subtly (or not) and test her reaction without crossing the line and explicitly seeking extras -- I understand masseuses in training are usually alerted to the likelihood of some clients experiencing erections during massages, even non-sensual ones, so it should not really be unexpected or alarming. Especially for a Frenchwoman -- they generally have fewer sexual hang-ups than most Western women. Btw, I guess that was the aspect missing from the review for me: how did she react to the tent -- with a knowing smile, impassive indifference, an irritated frown, or was it just too imperceptible for her to notice...? 

From an ethical perspective, if there is zero hint of any extras and all indications are that the shop and ML are totally legit, I probably would not have named the ML though, to avoid bringing unwanted attention from the lurking knuckle-draggers on this forum (even in the Silver Lounge). I differentiate this from those cases where previous reviewers have reported extras but I didn't get any, or where the ML did not provide any extra but invited the client to self-service in her presence -- neither of those instances would qualify as 'totally legit' in my book.

Apart from that, I think this was just a bit of harmless titillation with no obvious adverse impact on the ML.

Thanks Lustvader.

Massageboy, that's cool. I respect your opinion. You've commented on a few of my reviews and that's cool. Personally I've got no beef with you. We don't see eye to eye. It happens.

Mods feel free to delete my post. I'm happy to contribute to the AUXXX community simply by posting my strictly sexual experiences.

Cheers.

Reviews like this of non sexual experiences are fine...It's obvious this is legitimate massage therapy business providing health rebates etc. It clearly states in the review that no sexual services were offered or provided, which is valuable info for our members, and the reviewer was respectful throughout the experience. 

However it would be removed if there is any mention of harassment or disrespect towards the lady, or anything posted which may be viewed as sexual harassment.

massageboy quite often comments in this regard, to the point it is very annoying. We know you're point of view. What we choose to do is our business, no sexual harassment or assault has occurred so what is the issue? The fact of the matter is, there is a % of massage ladies who will not openly advertise they will do more than just a massage, whether it is because they don't want to devalue their work but are still open to the idea, or because they want to be very selective as to who they do it to, or whatever it is.

You are entitled to your views MA. I am not suggesting Cartman did anything wrong but I am saying that discussion of seeking of extras in legit shops is sailing close to the wind both morally and in some jurisdictions, legally, and should not be a feature of this forum.

I for one, enjoy hearing about Cartman’s adventures into the unknown. He may push some boundaries of the intent of a business but he’s always been respectful of them.

I have subscribed to Spring Retreat's information service, and received an email advertising Manon, the masseuse whom Cartman saw.  This what the message said about her:


WELCOME MANON TO THE SPRING RETREAT TEAM

Manon grew up on the French Riviera and specialises in relaxation massage. She is continuing her passion for massage with a remedial massage course in Sydney. 

When she's not working her massage magic, Manon loves yoga, fashion, travel, and photography. 

Give us a call or head to our website to book a rejuvenating relaxation massage with Manon this week!

I see both points of view and suggest that maybe it's slightly unhelpful to post a legit shop review in the context of "pushing the boundaries". Within here, we do have a forum for legitimate shop experiences and I'd agree that any apparent attempt to coerce a strictly legit ML into something more, is just not cool.

However, I didn't read Cartman's post that way... more the fact that he was "getting off" on the fantasy of something unexpected happening, yet knowing that it probably wouldn't. In that vein, I'd suggest that anyone here implying they are completely devoid of such fantasies are kidding themselves. Who has not cracked a boner in a legit shop at some time or other?! A couple of legit Caucasian MLs I know tell me it happens very frequently.

I actually indulge almost every possible 1-on-1 sexual fantasy in massage shops... such that all my posts these days require gold posting. And all without coercion or any unsavoury atmosphere surrounding coercion... and also because I absolutely love being massaged by a woman under any circumstance (otherwise I'd just be a brothel-dweller). Besides, nice guys open doors 

But the fantasy remains in legit shops... especially with Caucasian masseuses (more liberal Asian massage cultures having become de rigeur... thankfully!). Having had plenty of legit shop rubs, it is always part of the enjoyment of such a massage to fantasize 'what could be', always recognising that the prime reason for attendance is a good therapeutic massage... which was obviously the intent of Cartman. It is within this context that the "possibility" of extra indulgence can be achieved by a respectful and gentle approach. Offers can come from the most unexpected situations.

I suppose this leads to discussions on why some prefer the certainty of brothels and others prefer the potential of MPs  I'm sure there are threads somewhere...

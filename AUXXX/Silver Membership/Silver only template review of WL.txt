 Silver only template review of WL
				
Post Content: 
I'm going to post a template review here for WL's I have seen recently.

I don't want them posted in the public place if that is ok, because so far one of them has been shown every single one of those reviews in the thread by me and others and I am pretty sure she knows which ones I wrote due to the detail I put in. It isn't a massive issue for her, but it is for me, it is indiscreet.

I've had this happen for all my reviews in some way shape or form and soon, but respect to the mods, after I mentioned this in some thread somewhere, something got done. All the reviews I wrote for girls at Sussex Star and Sydney Baby  are no longer readable and I am ok with this. I guess they got moved to  the Gold lounge or something. 

I think my problem here is that I only see girls from a few shops and a fairly narrow selection, once I find one I like I tend to stick with them - multiple detailed reviews are going to stick out like a sore thumb.

 I appreciate the mods moving them out of sight as it has not happened  since this was done so far as I know.

I've had this similar scenario...when your on a good thing stick with it.... I actually had a top time at an old haunt a month ago but if I put it under the lower forum I'd be worried it would come back and bite me (or them) later...

Reviews for Sydney Babe are binned by us.. they crossed us financially and screwed us with advertising payment.. there affiliated shops botany130, top ryde190 and Empress Massage are also on the binned list as they are owned by the same.. 

Sussex Star are deleted as they have problems with the press and media.. which is well documented..

A question concerning reviews of shops  that may not meet With the site owner owners/moderators criteria. 

Do the posts made by forum contributors still get counted?

Yes they do.

An observation to keep in mind is Massage PARLOUR reviews posted here achieve no additional protection.

 The access rights for the Therapeutic Massage Parlour forums are the same as the Silver Lounge- cant be seen by bronze and below

It is unfortunate that the only two parlors I frequented in my run up to silver were Sussex and Sydney babe. 

That said, I don't got to Sydney Baby any more.The last two times I went there I was treated very poorly. The mamasan changed and the one there the time was awful. She managed to ruin everything that was good about that place and the way it was run. I heard many girls left there because of her - including my favorite - Ashily.

I go to JK Queen at Sussex a lot, it is a great shop, well run with a really nice and well organized mamasan, but I no longer post reviews for those visits because it doesn't really help anyone if they become hidden - I don't mind though and respect that this forum supports them the way they do.

In anycase I will easily exceed my review quota while on my new mission to sample the wide spectrum of Sydney CBD's abundant supply of independent working ladies

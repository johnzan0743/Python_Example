was heading out for a walk and then decided to give 8 railway parade in burwood a call and was informed that crystal who i have been hanging out for a visit. so I quickly did a detour and before i walked home i got into the car for a drive to see if crystal was free. As I was driving to burwood i kept thinking fuck what if i was expected home and began making excuses on how to handle it. Just as I arrived outside 8 railway parade i got a msg asking where the fuck i was . Like a flogged horse i drove past 8 railway parade to home just to find the person who msg me asleep. Has any one had similar situations.

Happens to me all the time. The missus seems to have a 6th sense about when I am on the way to or in the middle of a 'massage' and rings me. Drives me insane. Rarely can I rely on her sticking to her plans and leaving me free to punt without anxiety.

only been a problem once, when an ex rang three times while Bibi @ 533 was blowing me and I had to pick up the 3rd... Was rather interesting but not something I'd want to do again.

I have had calls driving, arriving at a brothel, in the intro room and while doing the deed. Best to leave if on silent mode and don't answer!

There are a few mobile blackspots around my suburb and I do call-outs as part of my (self-employed) job. I put the phone in flight mode before I walk in the front door for a punt and turn up an hour later when I've finished the "job". If I get a call in the car I can be on the way to or from a job or a supplier.

I always put my phone to do not disturb mode when punting. If the gestapo calls and it goes to voicemail, I simply say stuff such as ' I'm not sure why that happened, must have bumped/dropped it' or 'I had it off for the work meeting earlier, got distracted and forgot to put it back on.' Failing that, 'I forgot to charge it and ran out of juice.' Works every time.

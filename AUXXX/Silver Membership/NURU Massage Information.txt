 NURU Massage Information
				
Post Content: 
G'day fellow Punters,

I move between Sydney and Melbourne a fair bit as well as other cities in Australia due to work.   Tend to spend most of my time near the CBD in Sydney and Eastern suburbs in Melbourne.

I'm looking for recommendations of places that offer Full NURU massage experiences.   Particularly the places or girls that have a sukebe chair and finish with a BBBJ after using the NURU gel.

I'd prefer establishments but also wiling to meet Private Massage ladies, so any help greatly appreciated - will travel!

Thanks, CR

In Sydney , you can try Geisha Club at 244 Oxford St Paddington , they offer standard nude nuru massage with body slides and happy ending at $180/hr, and you can upgrade to the premium services for $100 more which will include BBBJ and FS. This is a licensed premises !

Cheers


Ps. If you are after the chair, similar nuru services + chair play can be found at the Chequers on Goulburn St opposite World Sq, it's called the King Massage, I think it's $189/hr ? Extras are not standard and you need to negotiate with the girl . Also you don't get to see the line up here so Geisha is more reliable !

This is not quite Nuru, but is a great nude Lingam Massage video to watch and I am now going to search Sydney to get a massage like this.

Thanks Sea Ray. 

If only all R&T setups used this video as instructional training material for new employes and existing WL's.

I quite like her "screwing the lid" technique.

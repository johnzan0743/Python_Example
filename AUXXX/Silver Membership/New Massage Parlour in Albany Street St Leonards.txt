 New Massage Parlour in Albany Street St Leonards
				
Post Content: 
Drove up Albany street today and the Massage Radar went off, saw a sign for "Massage" near the Wooden Whisk, must be about 38-46 Albany Street, opposite side to "our" Albany Street massage, down near the round about.

Could not TOFTT at the time, but will investigate over the next couple of days.

More Massage shops popping up in the vicinity daily...

No wonder there's always been a parking problem... even back in 1986

I am remiss in my TOFTT report when this place opened t'other month.

Short version: looks legit but I suspect extras, needs a return visit to confirm.

Longer version: first cottoned onto this place last month (or maybe a bit before that) when there was an Asian guy standing at the top of Albany, at the highway intersection, handing out flyers on this new place – and what tipped me was that I watched him for a bit and noticed he was only offering them to guys. "A-ha!" things FlyBoy! Further down the street, almost outside the shop, a young-ish lass was repeating the same strategy.

The flyer promised one massage and a second half-price, some opening special, which sounded pretty good. Pricing I think is the norm, $60/60mins. Shop has several decent-sized wooden panelled rooms, looks legit on all counts. Massage ladies were average-to-attractive, but certainly no old ones, and all who you'd be happy to experience 'extras' with.

By memory there were shorts to change into but I skipped those and stripped down for the massage to give the girl a hint that I was good for extras.

A decent massage from her, every now and again the slightest hint that there might be something extra – such as a slightly longer northwards stroke while massaging the inner thigh, and grazing of the sack, but nothing more than that. I angled my legs open a bit more to hint that more of this was welcome but that was as far as it went before the massage was over. At no stage did I get any feeling of her body being close enough to encourage a casual exploratory touch.

I figured that it would be worth going back because if the second massage is half-price then she needs to make some extra money off the treatment, so that's where a tug might follow the rub.

Thanks Flyboy for the pioneering adventure and detailed analysis !!

I am always for the sure thing but the beauty of the forum is that perhaps you have a new discovery !

The half price second visit sounds interesting , just wondering if ever there should be a council investigator , will he return for the second time too ?

Dud they give you a card of some sort for the return visit ?

I'm always fascinated by the handing out of massage flyers on the street. At what point could some moral crusader or jumped-up legal eagle attempt to infer soliciting?!!

Yes, I know to what you refer.

The only disadvantage they have is that Mina is not running the shop.

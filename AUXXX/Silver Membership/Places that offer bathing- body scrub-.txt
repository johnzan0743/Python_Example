Yeah I think I saw their ad in the local paper and I would bet money the ladies offer more than just a massage.

They definitely offer extras. Their website has "sydney prostitutes, sex in sydney, sexpages" and more listed. 

I meant I don't know if they provide a good service.

Anybody been to this Eastern Moon massage shop? Drove past it today and the signs screamed 'brothel' to me, looks like they specialise in having the ML give you a bath? Popular in SW China. You ask for a 'bath' instead of a 'massage'

Yeah, a lot of the Korean Spa places in the US offer a Table shower as part of the service. Always an excellent way to get ready for the room. Hopefully some of the team on the forum have experienced something similar locally so we can all we get a thorough bad boy washing....

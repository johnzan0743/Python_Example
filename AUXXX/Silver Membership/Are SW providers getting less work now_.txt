 Are SW providers getting less work now?

Just interesting. Two WL I've seen as well as the Mamasan at Yoko's have said that work has been slow lately. And slower than it usually is in the slow season. In fact one of them said she generally gets a bit of a boost in work right about now but it still hasn't changed.

It would be interesting to know if this is a general trend across the board and what you guys have heard in relation to it.

I heard that from a massage lady a few months ago. Construction and Retail industry in a slow period at the moment.

In the past 6 months, maybe longer, I have had several old contacts, wechat, parlours etc contact me telling me they are available, never used to get any.

It seems to me that the punt reports for private girls here on the reviews exceed the reports for massage Rnt.
If so does that indicate a new trend

Ladies at palours I visit have all commented on how slow their work is. I've noticed it too. For example at a couple of recent visits to Riverwood Cougars you would usually expect the doorbell to ring quite a few times within your hour stay, but I heard it ring once. 
Another place I visit the lady said she was getting less younger clients but more older clients. I think hook up apps like Tinder must play a big part in it.

I have a decent disposable income that I will happily spend on a good root. The problem is that a lot of these places are poorly run so don't encourage return business.

If there's any hot workers out there looking for a low maintenance regular client, feel free to PM me with pics and services on offer.

Just wondering if that has anything to do with RnT punters sometimes seem to see their regulars more often and therefore less new sessions to be reviewed? Only speaking from my own experiences though, there are a couple of my favorite MLs whom I would see once a month at least or sometime a couple of weeks in a row - I only punt once a week these days. So unless I venture outside of my regulars , there's nothing new to review really .

Thoughts ?

Ps. I actually did a walk in in two shops near Newtown recently where I hadn't been for years and neither one was anything special just in the area and felt the urge , I probably won't be returning to either shop anytime soon. And honestly , during the part 2 of both sessions, all I could think of was my favourite busty MLs in the city! Like, what the fuck am I doing here ??

Back in the day when I was a younger punter with raging hormones, during down economic periods like Dot Bomb and GFC if I did use commercial sex it would be with a regular. I was too risk adverse to try anyone new likes they had lots of good consistent reviews on forums. So you could be right.

One of my regular haunts has been complaining about how quiet it's been. I tend to view them as an unreliable narrator but I've heard similar things from other small businesses so it may be a tough trading environment all round. In the city it could also be effected by council actions and a subsequent drop in advertising spend and promotional activities.

In terms of reviews, there could some group dynamics going on? A few punters writing up private experiences spurs others to explore privates and write up their own experiences. Conversely, a drop in the number of regular contributors writing RnT reviews sees a same but negative effect on review numbers.

I think it could also be a reflection of the economy in general- poor wage growth, etc means less money for discretionary spending.

Ditto Poser. My suspicion this is the bigger driver for this slowdown in punting habits.

It's only going to get worse!!
I got the tap on the shoulder today that I am to be replaced by a Automated System. And that prick Frydenburg said we older people need to re skill and keep working to support the economy!! Scumbag (Scott Morrison) and his ministry of Rodents( Watch those do as I say not as I do take there parliamentary pensions) Is it any wonder the average punter is counting the Penny's.
F..K the Tory's 
Solidarity forever!!

You're not wrong there brother Bunty4,

Went to see Bonnie at Siam Sila yesterday, everything was so perfect, including a lovely bear hug greeting and chit chat with sexy mamasan Bella while I waited for Bonnie to arrive, even the new young Vietnamese girl whatever her name is whose very sweet and pretty too, but of course she has no chance of earning my tip any time soon, not when E Cups Bonnie and Double D Cups Nina are around ! That session yesterday just put my two off adventurous punts at 447 and May St to more shame, thou shalt not waste your hard earned money to people who was simply not worthy !

One dead punt I had at Pyrmont 200 has put me so off that I have had 3 dry weeks and my regular ML is angry about God knows what.....she gives my classic massage but refuses to give extra....she refused tips...I do leave pineapple behind....but no love yet....feels I will have to retire from punting early....feeling really lowðŸ™„. Will see what this weekend and next week brings in.

 Cheap Asian RnT with showers?
				
Post Content: 
Are there any cheap Sydney Asian RnT massage places that have showers for punters to use? I'm getting fed up with being given just a Kleenex to clean up afterwards. And also wary of how clean or not so clean the wet towel cleanups are.

Yep sure is but it is a nude b2b service with gorgeous Thai girls and great tables service and great showers

Stanmore on Parramatta Road Northern side just up from the intersection 

Link here I think.

https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f59/t...60-5755-a-312/

Additionally opposite South side of Parramatta road at 208 is Massage Oasis same deal almost.

Contact Us | Massage Oasis


Two decent shops both still operating I think.

Happy to be of assistance.

Might be helpful if you provide a geographical area you are interested in but 176 in Enfield and its sister shop in Lidcombe certainly do have showers. They are cheap and provide good service.

Well signaturexxx helped me in the past and if you were him, I thank you for that. It seems I might have opened a can of worms and that wasn’t my intention. A bit of naivety on my part perhaps.

Agreed, some form of geographical location would be a help.....
But if your in Southern Sydney 152 Flora St Sutherland has a shower for punters to use......it's usually clean and has pump soap....

Enfield is perfect for you then. Just beware that they are more interested in FS than HJs but you can get them of course.

I highly recommend Sydney Baby Massage - showers in most rooms and it's $120 all inclusive for an hour. Girls are always hot and young but of course YMMV!

On the North Shore - Lindfield Body Care - next to Coles on pacific Highway
Northern Beaches -  Body Care 2000 Dee Why Oaks ave (02) 9972 0257
Mona Vale Thai Massage Waratah street 0406 671 140

All three offer 1 hour, naked, HJ for $110. Good enough showers (some are shared) Many girls will go further for no extra for regular clients. First two are connected to each other and some of the girls work at both ( as well as one of the super hot receptionists)

 Cheap Asian RnT with showers?
				
Post Content: 
Here's my list of familiar Sydney north shore Asian MPs with shower facilities... in no particular order or service provision.

There's others I've forgotten... while some are deliberately omitted due to changed circumstances.

390 Pacific Hwy Lindfield
346 Pacific Hwy Lindfield
126 Hampden Rd Artarmon
104a Hampden Rd Artarmon
88 Hampden Rd Artarmon
44 Hampden Rd Artarmon
790 Pacific Hwy Gordon
71-73 Archer St, Chatswood
1/200 Katherine St Chatswood
3/6 Help St Chatswood
24 Oscar St Chatswood
32 Pacific Hwy St Leonards 
401 Pacific Hwy Crows Nest
459 Pacific Hwy Crows Nest
1251 Pacific Hwy Turramurra

These are all massage shops. All require respect and in some cases request, for shower service

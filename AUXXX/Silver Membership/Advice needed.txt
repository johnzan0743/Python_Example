I'm tempted to say get a divorce and start enjoying life. But that would show just how bitter and twisted I've become 

If you value your marriage, you'll have to axe the profile, keep up the convincing and rebuild trust. It might take time. Women have long memories.

Oh, and in future, FFS don't ID yourself on the web 

Good luck James

Too late to claim identity theft. Let her know you made a mistake, treat it as bit of joke and don't be too defensive. Might be a good idea to spend some money on the misses . Good luck.

As one who has been in an open relationship for ten years, I suggest you consider anther option...  talk with your wife, very openly and very honestly.  After I split from my wife 15 years ago (she found my "little black book") I discovered that there are many women out there who harbour secret desires and who will jump at the chance, if offered, to get a little dirty.

Here's your first big hard question though: will you accept her doing what you (would like) to do.  If you can't give her as much freedom as you want for yourself, you have a big issue.

Assuming you can cope, you need to use every resource you can imagine to show her options for a different lifestyle.  Adult Match Maker (AMM) has lots of useful information as well as lots of interesting profiles - she may be tempted to read.  Make it a bit of fun - sit down with her and prepare a couple profile for yourselves - as an experiment.  You don't have to actually meet anybody if she's not ready, but what if she gets excited?  Who knows, the process of preparing a profile itself could be an eye opener - when you get to the "interests" section, let her take the lead and maybe discover her hidden fantasies.

If you follow this path, you can explain Tinder as an early exploration - building knowledge before broaching the subject with her.

FWIW my current partner (10 years now) knew of my lifestyle from the start, and was initially suggesting 1 way monogomy - I could fuck any woman I wanted but she would keep herself for me.  I didn't think that would work and said that she should go for it.  Her reaction was amazing - she always wanted to do exactly that.  Over the following year or so she went from timid exploration to taking the lead and now is often the one who activates the transition from social to sexual when we are with swinging friends.

Remember - denial is dangerous - you have already been caught out and you won't be trusted.  Take it slow and careful, but keep it simple and honest - you have as much chance that way of opening a new door as you have of losing it all through poorly judged lies.

Good luck with it.

Own up and deal with the consequences. She'll never trust you again anyway, so trying to hide it for the rest of your life is a recipe for disaster.
I know I'll be headed for divorce if caught, but I simply can't live without pussy.

Good luck

Couldn't agree more. The pity is though... despite the hype of things like "50 Shades"... most women don't appear to agree

Hence, all the clandestine punting

JamesJl  , I guess your the  only one who knows your wife, what type of relationship you have.
from my experience with my wife make her feel special for a week , so she will remember what you give her so she will think of the positives not the negatives.
From my observation , not much has happened it is only you being curious putting a profile up .  it might even spice things up women are very competitive 
Good Luck!

Good points indeed.

Schadenfreude. Pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others. While rarely acknowledged as an active emotion in relationship difficulties or breakdowns, the concept is very much alive and well in that domain.

There is absolutely no doubt that women will "rally around" to add fuel to a fire even when there's no fire.

James, once you have done whatever you think possible to mollify your wife, I think it would then be fair to seriously question her association with this "friend" who obviously would see pleasure in having someone join her in the ranks of the jilted.

Yeah, no accounting for some people!

Softcock... Jiran yet again? Your post appears to have disappeared from my screen... oh yes, you've been banned again!!!

However, FYI, as I'm sure you'll be back to annoy us with another handle soon, I already have 27 reviews this year plus another 7 follow-ups.

Of course, as Gboat1 has explained, you have never posted anything worthwhile, so you have no rank and won't have seen them.

Apologies JamesJL for that ignorant interruption to your thread.

Wishing you the best in this one mate. Trust is a big issue for girls. Easily lost and fucking hard to get back - if ever. 

Been there and still doing that and it sux. If you're not interested in a divorce like Hard has suggested then Toads advice is gold. Turns a serious negative into win-win positive if it works. Good luck mate.

I'm more interested in if tinder has worked for you??? I have a secondary FB and a tinder profile, linked to my punting phone. Yet to manage any quality hookups.

But i'm very very careful only to turn it on when i'm outside of areas where I could be identified. I don't use it where I grew up or where i'm living now. I make sure the phone has location services off, and my profile deactivated around home.

Mate

I would say it was done as a joke with some mates
I would then question your wife as to why her friend is intent on stirring up trouble. Turn it around. You were having a joke and her friend has turned it into the Inquisition. Why is she intent on trying to break us apart.

After doing this do not raise it again. Ladies have a sixth sense and if you continue to talk about the situation she will believe it more and more.

If you want to stay married, you may need to stop punting for a while and devote your spare time to the misses. You did marry her for a reason. 

Good luck Bro

Hey mate,
This is one of the best advice, IMHO.
However, I don't think he needs to stop punting - actually I think punting is more "marriage-friendly" than tinder or other dating sites.

 Tinder is a golden pot of ladies willing to open theor legs for you on a regular baisis. Its an art rather than anything else. Many tricks to it but once you know then you're golden. Sex on tap with multiple females for very little expense.

Maybe I should write a guide to tinder hahaha

Sorry it took so long to reply this thread dissappeared.

I just blamed the profile on fooling around witha mate to see what it was. Lucky i managed to convince her so all good now. I appreciate the help though guys!

Block all contacts you have made, 
Create fake profiles as women and message your profile with offers to meet for nsa fun nights, which you reply with, your here out of boredom and curious about what all the fuss was about, you still find your wife as sexy as ever, but feel that she may be loosing interest in you and found the reaction made you feel better about yourself which gives you the confidence to try and bring back the spark in your marriage and felt more confident in attempting to bring back the days of lust that you used to have for each other, as you were a little concerned that she might be feeling the same, and what better place to find advice and suggestions than from woman who are already in that situation,

And be warned she will have spyware installed asap on ur device so stay super clean, now this is the most important part so pay attention... go see a lawyer and account and start preparing for separation and protect your assets and start preparing for the worst so you can put yourself in a better position if it goes that way, really hope it doesn't but if it does, they will be doing the same thing while attacking you and while you are still trying to keep it together her lawyer is feeding her instructions on how to manipulate you where he needs you to be, cause they will make her think that there looking after her and she will believe him when really they are just looking at the new Porsche they want and you both will be paying for

Just one tip for punters. I am single but have a TAB account t and have a good win every now and then. Its a good way to have some money put away that no one knows about, especially your partner. And unless you are married to a tyrant, they are not going to worry about you putting say $20 or so dollars into it every now and then and you don't have to share your winnings as she will think your a typical man anyway and can't win anything......just a thought.

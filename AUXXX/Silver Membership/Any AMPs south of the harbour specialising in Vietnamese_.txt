 Any AMPs south of the harbour specialising in Vietnamese?
				
Post Content: 
Hi Folks,

Anyone willing to share details of AMPs in the CBD or south of the harbour which are mostly staffed by Vietnamese MLs? I've already tried the only lead I can find which is a shop in Montgomery St Kogarah reportedly with mostly Viet MLs however it has proved to be 100% Thai so far (3 from 3). Backpage/Cracker is not offering up anything either - just the occasional Viet ML on specific days at some shops which is not much help when the Viet bug bites at random! I'm looking for something like D'Privilege in Chatswood for those who know it (but preferably without the high price tags!).

Thanks for reading. Any leads welcomed and feel free to PM if discretion is required!

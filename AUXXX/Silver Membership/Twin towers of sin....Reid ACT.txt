 Twin towers of sin....Reid ACT
				
Post Content: 
Story in Canberra Times this morning indicated that police and Border Force raided three apartments that were operating illegal brothels...and arrested various ladies who did not have a work permit.

There are probably 150 apartments in these two blocks of flats....I am guessing that half of them would be ML's and WL's.....so the police must have been been operating on a very limited brief

I wonder if any ladies have friends in the liberal party. No worries on the visa front in that case, just call in a favour and hey presto.

The Police were acting from tip-offs from members of the Public - probably either neighbour(s) or a disgruntled punter perhaps

Here is the Canberra Times article :  Police raid on Reid Brothels

Speaking of Tower of Sins, I have to put in my 2 cents: 29 Newland St Bondi Junction in Sydney !

I must have cum like a ðŸ’¯ times inside this building on various floors and many different units !

Just before the residents took action and got rid of them , the At Michelle's gang were occupying half of the 5th Floor studio units while the Misty's sinful dens were scattered across the opposite end of the corridor!

Those were the days !

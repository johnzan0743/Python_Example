 Another new massage shop in St Leonard
				
Post Content: 
Driving down Herbert Street St Leonards towards Pacific Highway I sight a familiar sign, the age old picture of the female and male couple being massaged posted on the glass of a new shop.

Google tells me that it is about #12 or 14 Pacific Highway St Leonards.

I know some o you guys work where you can look out the window and see the Harmony shop at #32, have any of you looked into the new shop.

And now this question, Legit or not???  Who can tell.

I think I am going to have to find out,.....TOFTT

I used to work across the road but have since moved on. In North Sydney now and missing the convenience of a great HJ so close

I mistakenly googled Herbert st...SBS is number 14.. lots of sex transmitted from that address  : ) 


It is a few doors down from Harmony.. Near the Subway.  I think it was a hair and beauty shop... maybe has had a recent change?

If so, even more competition..

I also drove past this one today - we just need some punter to STOP at this new shop!

Further notes: it faces into Herbert St, is right at the traffic lights on that intersection in fact. Sits between a travel agency and some Chinese 'health and beauty' place. Name is "Saint L..." but the L-word didn't seem to be "Leonards".

Will try it out next weekend if the opportunity arises.

You have no hope, what will all the Flight Attendants and English Language Students throwing themselves at you 

But thanks for the offer of such a noble sacrifice.

Flight attendant is on different routing for the next fortnight. Always up for an ESL honey, but you know me Chalk, I am always willing to take a punt, after all it's what unearthed more than a few amazing ladies in the past!

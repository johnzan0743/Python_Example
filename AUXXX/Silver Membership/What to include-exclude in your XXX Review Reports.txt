 What to include/exclude in your XXX Review Reports
				
Post Content: 
Mods, I am wondering if this topic is worth giving some oxygen to?

When I post a review, I almost always make it accurate and complete in every way. But in a few cases I have stopped short of giving a full report. Examples include, where out of the blue a well known ML has given me full service after a massage and I am virtually certain this is a unique occasion (i.e. I have read dozens of reviews on her and none of them hint at her even taking her top off). So I thought I should keep it quiet because, among other things, it would enable her to know it was me who spilt the beans.....and it would blow my anonymity on this site.

The other occasion is when I visit a very popular massage place and one of the young ML's offers me a bbbj, or full service, or maybe slips me her phone number and says she will come to my hotel. I know that if her Mamasan hears about any of these things, it will result in her instant dismissal.....so I tone the report down a bit by maybe giving her an honest report on massage and HE....and then maybe say something along the lines that more might be available.

Will leave it to you if you wish to open this up or close it down....DB

Good post David Banks. This topic usually comes up after a dickhead shows a review to a  lady. First and foremost you must protect yourself from identification by the lady. If she sees a review and works out its you, it will get very messy, very quickly. Nobody wins when this happens and it invariably turns nasty. Remember she most probably has your phone number....

You are not obliged to put the actual date of your visit in a review, eg November 2017 is fine. This cuts down the odds of detection considerably. You can also leave out or 'water down' services which you think may be unique to you,also references to your nationality could also be a giveaway. Think of all the things that could give you away and leave them out. You can also let it be known that you will field questions via PM if anyone wants to know more. Then its up to you how much, and to whom you wish to disclose more details.

Having said that we still want reviews to be of value to our members so we need a reasonable account of what happened in a review.

You are doing the correct thing in your second point. We have to protect ourselves and we must protect the ladies as much as we can too...I dont think theres much more you can do. 

But the best solution is to keep posting reviews and aim for Gold level membership.....

What you may find is you're not the only guy getting FS, BBBJ and her phone number. I don't know why some guys think they are so special it only happens to them? I would probably stop at mentioning BB services . I do remember one place where I thought I was the only one getting special treatment, then found out it was pretty much standard. Post what you're comfortable with and don't give too many clues about yourself like braunic seems to do. He has been caught out a few times. I try to see different girls.

I agree.     Just tell it as it happens, that's what I do.      If you think it is really special and you want it to be a secret, don't submit a review.      

I also like to know which days the lady works, others may like to sample (or avoid) her services.    Surely this is why we are submitting reviews!     If you forget to ask, post the day of the week of the visit.

In addition to all the good advice above, a review should not embellish the nature of the services provided, especially applicable to MLs. That just raises false hopes amongst some readers and places unreasonable expectations on the lady to replicate extras she may never have actually provided previously.

Doing well, David Banks 

Notwithstanding the requirement to 'tell it like it is' for continued forum value, as Nextlife has pointed out there needs to be a level of protection for both punter and ML in certain circumstances. In particular because some described activity occurs in a massage parlour and is therefore operating outside approved regulation or else services MAY be personally exclusive...... perhaps 

The additional level of protection on this forum is the ability to climb the ladder according to an individual's contribution. For those availing themselves of additional services that they may wish to keep somewhat exclusive to trusted members, the suggestion is to keep reviewing in the spirit of the forum according to experiences and status level and at some point your prowess will be acknowledged with the keys to higher privilege.

Those 'on the take' - who read everything at any given level but who contribute little - are eventually dealt with accordingly.

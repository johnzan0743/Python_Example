... 'probably' best not to speculate..that can lead to rumours and inaccurate, ill informed half assed reports.

Police were arresting people for an assault a week or so ago:

Thanks for that EG. 
Yes it appears that opportunity meets victim although it is not yet clear whether the parties knew each other.
A bit concerning as the assault and robbery were allegedly committed inside the Premises which may have ramifications for the two businesses. The search warrants issued were acted upon by Surry Hills Officers and arrests made at the premises along with a further arrest at the Sydney Police Centre.

Best avoid these shops for a little while.

My two cents.

The thread on the other site is pages long and  full of speculation, rumour and abundant inane commentary on this subject. 
No need to drag this thread into the same sort of endless one liner nonsense..

Here hear. Totally agree. Speculation and rumour are two ingredients of mischief. And not the good kind. Perhaps a mod might think it best to end this thread as the benefit is unlikely to outweigh the downside of allowing it to continue. Especially as it can be a google search result. Even if only temporary.

Sorry WAK, that was meant to be a "Like" not a "Funny post".

But I was going to comment yesterday on the fact that this subject highlights the difference between this forum and Syd99.

On Syd99 the thread re this subject started at 13:12 on Wednesday and in the first 24hrs attracted 198 posts, nearly all inane one-liners, comprising pointless speculation or going off-topic.  (It's now up to 248 posts making up 13 pages.)

This thread started at 17:42 the same day and in the first 24hrs it attracted just 8 posts.

I know which forum I prefer!!!!

Saabai Saabai Thai Massage 158 Elgin St Carlton

House of Thai Massage 101B Sydney Rd Brunswick

Been to both 2-3 times recently. Impressed with the attractiveness of the girls and the quality of the massages, but seemingly no extras at either place at all.

A search of the forum didn't help either. Was wondering if there are any hidden gems here...

Can't help with "hands-on" knowledge, but just did the Google Map fly-by.

Saabai Saabai Thai Massage 158 Elgin St Carlton



Street-front store, see-through window, no red neon "MASSAGE" sign, Thai - I would put my money on legit.

House of Thai Massage 101B Sydney Rd Brunswick



Upstairs, side laneway entrance, red neon sign (around the corner), pretty tatty-looking. I would have picked this as a very good dodgy prospect, except that it is Thai, which slightly reduces the odds. I would certainly have given it a try but not sure I would keep going back if you are not getting the goods in 2-3 visits.

Thanks BB for having a look. Saabai doesn't have the sign, agreed. And yeah, House of Thai just screams dodgy, but nothing so far. Tissues in the cubicles though... Might try one more visit when $ allows and see how I go. At the very least I walk out with a super massage.

Took up the challenge and dropped into 101B Sydney Rd. Easy parking in the back street. It was after 4pm so have to watch the clearway. Good entry off that little park, very discrete. Up the stairs. Had called and booked. Unfortunately I got the mamasan and not the young cutie that was working. Got shown a mattress on the floor on the main section that only has curtains and no sound separation. Not sure if there is a private room somewhere. Ok firm massage but not a hint of anything and I don't think likely given there is no separation.

Thanks Like for taking up the challenge in Brunswick. 

I went for the Carlton challenge today and saw Rachel again for a massage (she's the lass I've been keen to see if anything else is on offer). 45 minutes for $60. Absolutely first class massage from her, but nothing else. And a really nice bod. Fit, slim (despite her protests to the contrary), and a rack that is definitely F-cup, if not bigger. Had a great conversation with her as well after I realized it was legit all the way.

Four visits with no luck; three with the same girl. I'm calling this one (Saabai Thai) legitimate. But can recommend the massage.

Dean.

Went to Saabai today, older lady called Na. Other girl Vivian is busy. I was taken to the third room, which is fully enclosed (the front two are not). First time I've been here that someone was happy to work without a towel or sheet covering me. Good Thai massage with some sensual flourishes. About 10 minutes to go, she shuts and locks the door. She asks if I want whole body massage. I say yes, she gets out a pillow, I flip, again no covering. Starts massaging my inner thigh. I ask if she can massage anywhere else, she smiles at me and says, no, we are a legal massage shop. Ah well, I asked. If I was going to have any luck, it would be with an older lady in a place like this.

As I was leaving, "Vivian", who was the other lady on, came around the corner, and it's none other than Gypsy from Sukho Thai, who did do HJs there. She recognized me, said hello, so who knows what may be possible. For the moment though, I'm closing the book on this venue as being 100% legit, and only dropping in to get a massage from Rachel when I need to update my spank bank visuals.

Dean.

Post Content: 
Hi all,just wondering if you guys have any info dor renting a room for maybe 4-6 hrs during the day?preferably smoking allowed which makes it much harder...
I know dayuse.com have some good deals but I'm sure they would be smoke free..

Try the Blakehurst Motor Inn, Princess Hwy Blakehurst. Does rooms for half a day, no questions asked. Must admit, have used it myself on numerous occasions to entertain some very accommodating young ladies (but that's another story not really for sharing on this forum.)

most smaller motel/hotels are affordable for day use..

Dayuse.com  is always updating availability .


Recently I have been using Meriton Suites in different areas.. Good value for a nice furnished room,  king bed big showers  etc. 

Check their site for closest near you.

I know the one at Carrs Park has definitely gone but not sure about the one on the highway at Blakehurst. I do know there was a development application put in with the Council but whether it got anywhere I am not sure. The last time I had a short time stay was at the end of 2017. Am sure there are a few motels/hotels in the area that can accommodate Padraig.

Most motels / hotels have a 4-6 hour rate, I know of 3 bigger name hotels in Glen Waverley that offer this service, depending on the day costing between $80-$120. Check out hotels.com to start looking for a low rate in your area and then ring the hotel and ask for a room for 4 hours. I have used this service at least once a month for 18 months.

 Question about affiliates
				
Post Content: 
Hi guys,

Long time member, inconsistant poster but i just had a bit of a silly question...

I noticed that we have a few affiliated places on the site on our main page and that reviews for these sites are accessable even though we arent logged in. 

As most of you guys, i like to keep a low profile. I try to be as respectful as i can  in my reviews while sharing info, i am very hesitant to post because one of the places i frequently visit is highly visible to anyone who stumbles on the site.

Is it frowned upon to post reviews in Silver? Or am i being hypocritical as i am posting about sexual services and hiding behind my monitor as i post about someone's livlihood? 

Cheers guys...

By all means post in silver and relevant thread there.. massage shop reviews apart from those advertising cannot be seen unless your silver or above.. 

There maybe a double thread buried there also.. so you may continue on from there..

Thanks for the response mate

I might post a bit more often in here for the sites that are affiliated, but will continue to post as normal when appropriate

Cheers

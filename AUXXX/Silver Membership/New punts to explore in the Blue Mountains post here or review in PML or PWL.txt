 New punts to explore in the Blue Mountains post here or review in PML or PWL
				
Post Content: 
There are a few ladies in the Blue Mountains or the base of them Jenna is one with her own thread.

There are the occasional ringers such as this lass. https://nsw.locanto.com.au/ID_348124...Mountains.html

Not cheap by any means but clearly there are numerous ladies who have retired to the BM and still do the odd massage or service to pay the bills.

Anna aka Heidi in Leura and the above lass in Faulconbridge.

The offerings are far from cheap but at least there are offerings. There are many at the base of the mountains and a few on the tablelands.
It really doesn’t take much research to uncover those who call the region home.

Rather than speculate on the review thread I figured it best if we accommodate the thoughts collectively of those who might be worthy of a review and hence interest in that area of the Sydney basin.

Dalia is another one to explore. Don’t know whether she has been reviewed here however she was in Bondi then Maroubra region,. Now moved into the BM where housing is more affordable.

She gives a good tug or used to. Older Gilf now. Located in Cliff Drive Katoomba.

Now the reason for starting this thread is the decline of opportunities in the Mountains Lynette has disappeared not that any tears will be shed. 

There is the Lady near Penrith Narelle who has authored this link 
Sexually Well | natural strategies better sex

She has been sampled by more members who have not reviewed her here ...

God knows she can charge but needs a reality check. A few of us have ploughed her but she thinks her value is greater than it actually is. She likes the younger lads but works her magic in an indiscriminate way...lol She can charge over the odds.
Not assisted by those paying OTT.

Now of course there are a number who are located in Penrith or close to the foot of the mountains who have been reviewed. Thing is to travel up the mountain is to know the joy of fresh air. 

So finding other things fresh is the idea here.

So add intel here and post reviews to the forum when possible. Thanks .

There may be some plagiarism given that Narelle might have copied a namesake from Syd Uni with the same name. But most certainly she has traded off the publications attributed to her name. It matters little as she promotes a better lifestyle through food.

Itchykoo massage is Narelles baby and she does enjoy giving you a great time. She loves the younger guys but is not cheap but if you have a good imagination then she would be money well spent. She has a thread in Private Therapeutic massage.under Western Sydney Kahuna ...

Good to know SR! Aside from Jenna, I always thought it was a waste land up there.

It appears to be somewhat of a wasteland but looks can be deceiving as we all must surely have found out at times...

Thing is the Classifieds mostly now have been abandoned by the workers in Adult Services. Brings the obvious issues of how to advertise where to advertise and why bother advertising....

There are good reasons to advertise. Doing so on this forum means keeping Comms in front of mind and keeping the advertisers in clients...

After all it is a numbers game...

Anyone with any information should post to this thread and if a review to the General forum.....

It appears the Foot of the Mountains is losing a great punt. Some of us have appreciated...Narelle S.

Think she found a man and has gone south....a bit too far south for most.... still there are places in the Mountains and a few privateers. You would be surprised at the few well hidden Gems uncovered over the years. Including those not hiding...lol

Now Anna K aka Heidi Horne is realising now how not looking after her website is detrimental to the health of her business.

She is contacting those she has on her contact list to get her business going again. I responded and told her I had already come up the mountains this month....

I don't think she got the joke...

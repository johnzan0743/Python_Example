i drive for a living and do set routes, and ive noticed a massive increase in asian massage parlours,. im not talking about the ones that operate out of homes, those are close to extinction, its the ones that have the neon sign "open" with the massage boards out the front, and the male or female person getting a massage on the front window.. high street rd glen iris, ashburton, theres 3 of these within 1.5kms out near tottenham station, theres 3 within 50 metres of each other, canterbury rd blackburn, another one has just popped up, within 100 metres of another one, blackburn station, theres 2 within 50 metres of each other i mean come on, is there really that much demand for this in an economy which gets worse every day, Have these asian run places done there market research, or are they just opening these places up because they have no real job skills. Little block of shops, u see a shop with a lease sign, then a few weeks later its another asian massage shop.  Do we really need this many????????????

It's easy cash money. Why else do you think they are springing up like rabbits? If there weren't guys happy to fork out $100 to $120 for a basic massage with a HJ they wouldn't survive. I know one near me that is right next door to a local politician's office! Its been operating for at least 3 years and more have opened up in every shopping strip

Read post #2. Does it really matter? No one is forcing you to have a massage. They aren't all that cheap. Most start at $70hr. You can even find a decent massage for $50hr.

I don't think it has anything to do with the economy. We are not living in Cyprus! Many guys look for value for money. As strange as it seems you can get better value in a brothel, without the hassles, starting at $100 half and less for quickies.

the amps will close when woolworths starts their own massage places and you can use your shop-a-dockets there.


and the coles ad: "Down, down" will have another meaning.

And god forbid that your local butcher is out of stock with your favorite T-Bone or Rump!

I think you will find many will close shop unless they offer outstanding service, or good value for money! Interesting how the majority are Chinese run, even in shopping centres. If you can't get a job, open a massage shop! 

Unfortunately poor massage skills doesn't mean repeat business. What I find disappointing is they all ask the same money, can't massage at all, cut your time short by a good 10 mins, or more, then want up to $50 for a basic HJ and even walk out to answer the phone, or door during time! 

If punters are happy with all that they will survive! For me I can't be bothered at all with shit service, then get asked for a tip and pushed out the door before time! Vote with your feet.

Couldnt agree more! I much prefer to find a PML - my preference is Caucasian, but there a some very good Asians working from home or independently. Better massage, more personalised service, shower facilities , cleaner premises (including towels!)  And no real difference in price.....

Disappointed the economical supply & demand model is not working where prices are decreasing, but realistically, it seems instead that prices are going up instead and some places that just can't survive are closing down.
I know a few in the Eastern suburbs that have had to close down recently, which does indicate of the high supply of these places.

Hi All,

I have just returned from the US (West Coast).  Barely any massage places there.  Now after a 15 hour flight, you need a massage, legit or not!!!  Couldn't find one, and when I did, only open at certain times.  I would always welcome an over supply of services.  That way competition is high, price low and the opportunity for extras is also high.

Cheers

Mate, I would not even bother. Seriously, there are enough guys (no offense me included) that are up for a rub and tug. Lets face it, there are like ten fold on here that do not even report their adventures. I know because I have written reports and I know like you guys the regulars. Its like 20-30 of us...... So beyond that how many girls do you think will do this work??? Do the math and think... Is it really worth paying the $$$$ to buy someone out?? for what??  Hmmmm Nope.
I'd recruit a few girls, pay them well, look after them AND let all you guys know :-)
BTW, I would also make sure I change and wash the towels, make it clean and comfy and make you all fee like its home (without the.... you know!!)

Cheers
BTW... maybe I will :-)

I agree, too many AMP out there but where else can you find a tug at their price levels? Fingers crossed the new budget forces hot Anglo females out of schools and into the tug business ha

So, looks like the RnT shops are popping up everywhere in Melbourne, same here in Sydney !

Look, the reality is, most of the mls know they can't do RnT forever, and since they don't have too much other skills and the one business they think they know how to run is the RnT , so what do you think, they open their own shop and be their own boss!!

My friend from Snow Lotus used to work for someone and she now owns two shops, Coco used to work for Vicky now she runs her own shop in Stanmore, after a short partnership in Burwood.

Summer used to work at Stanmore now runs two shops in Thairepreutic ? and Bamboo massage, Candy used to work at SL opened her own shop at QVB then another shop in Pennant Hills Road.

The QVB shop had since been sold to Nicole who used to work there and the Pennant Hill shop is about to change hand and the new owner. Yes, you guess it, one of the ml who used to work there!!

Need more examples ??

Of course, some of these shops will blossom and some of them will fail, but believe me, there are no shortage of new buyers who are willing and able and ready and cash up to jump in and take over !

This is the fact, to take over an existing shop don't take a lot of initial investment, depends on the location and business level and facilities , you can pick up a shop between $20k to $50k

Most experienced mls will easily have that kind of cash in hand.

The running cost is very low - rental obviously need to be affordable , but a suburb shop is usually not to expensive , may be $600-$800 a week !

If a shop started with 10 jobs a day, very conservatively. the shop's cut is $250! Times 7 days, the owner can make a small profits already, if she picks up a job or two herself per day, she will be earning twice of my salary !

So why won't RnT shops keep popping up!

Cheers


Ps. Some of you may think there are too many shops, are there enough customers, my own experience is, most likely. Because they are everywhere, and most men know what these shops are offering so there presence actually created more demands !

Like I used to visit once a week, now may be two or three times, Tom , dick and Harry used to jerk off themselves, now they pay $55 and let a young Asian girl do it for them! That's life !

One more point, and this is some inside intel from my mamasan friends, a lot of their regular clients are older gentlemen who are enjoying their retirement life and a weekly visit to the local RnT shops are fast becoming a highlight of their otherwise pretty boring and uneventful old age life.

These gentlemen enjoy the companies of much younger Asian lasses, especially when they are naked and playing with their willy. And may be due to their advance years, they may not be that comfortable going to FS shops - fear of performance issue, can't get it up, can't finish the job, sure, the big V may help, but apparently a session in the Rnt shop is much more relax and enjoyable. and if you are in your 60's or 70's sure, you may still only like 20's yr old young MLs but many are OK with the MILFs, so there are a whole new market out there for the RnT shops, the elderly male and still horny pensioners market. So rather than blowing their pension money on pokies and the local pub, many of them are now blowing them in a massage joints !!

Just my two cents

Cheers

Theres nothing wrong with not being able to get it up. Its not always important, in fact i have seen a girl named elle out at st.albans and the last 2 sessions there just been some teasing and touching.  Sometimes caressing is more enjoyable than the sex.

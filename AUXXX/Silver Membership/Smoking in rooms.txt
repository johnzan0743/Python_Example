Post Content: 
Hi all.just a quick query,quite a few wls smoke ice as a quick fix to stay awake during long work hours and have said it improves their libido etc so they can carry out their service better.do you mind them smoking it when you are in the room with them?I dont know much about ice myself but can it be detected if you were stopped for a random drug test on the way home?(just from the fumes or if the wl blows the smoke on you while giving a bj or kissing) etc..

Would not entertain it and would leave the room if such a thing was suggested.

I don't give a damn what the girls do before and after I am in their hands

Perhaps reality cuts in and then again maybe not. If you encourage anyone to consume Ice especially by inhaling it as smoke or byproduct vapour then you really should be aware of the mood swings and nature of Ice addiction.

Meth is a curse. Far worse than Heroin addiction and potentially way more addictive.

If you encounter a worker using Ice then the simple way to react is to walk or run away as quick as you can. Don't bother waiting for a refund cause delaying your exit by requesting the very lifeblood of the means to continue this insidious addiction will make you an object or target to remove from their world with prejudice.

Whatever you do save yourself and get the fuck outa there.

I have witnessed the results of a Psychotic episode that is almost impossible to intervene with any level of success without using a level of force most cannot comprehend.

Tasers and Cap spray cannot stop an ICE induced psychotic episode.

It is fucking scary and totally unpredictable. If anyone has seen the effects of resuscitation on an OD of Heroin with Narcan and the resulting assaults on Paramedics and Medical staff Cops included and the realisation these drugs create monsters that are near impossible to control as you bring these individuals back from death and they strike out because you have removed their high and countered the effect of the narcotic agent.

If you want to be Educated as to why you never engage with Meth addicts then perhaps the evidence visual in this link might convince you to stay away.

But if you believe that libido enhancement is a resulting good thing then perhaps look in the mirror and ask yourself the questions avoided to date.

I hear that having sex on a cliff top is exciting too. But how many of us would actually engage in this thrill?

Nuff said.

Roadside drug testing kits would simply not pick up anything because there is nothing to pick up unless you have ingested the drug by inhaling it deliberately.

It is done by a saliva test and that would mean you need it in the bloodstream to affect the saliva.

Being in the same room with a drug user would never result ina positive test. These tests are only indicators.

Rest easy. Breath out.

Question I would pose is why would you engage with any worker who overtly informs you they are a Meth user?

Yes I have to agree with that. It really is unfortunate.

Heroin was the drug used in the 70's and 80's and most common route of ingestion was Intravenously. Ice Methamphetamine is ingested by inhaling through a pipe or injection. 

Smoking and inhaling is the most common form of taking the drug.

The above link should give you an idea of how to Educate yourself with the facts dealing with this scourge.

Avoiding workers who use this is the best advice on offer.

Street workers were renowned for Heroin addiction back 30 to 40 years ago.

Look for poor skin poor hygiene and makeup coverup. Also engaging in conversation you begin to get an idea of how this drug affects cognitive processes. 

If in doubt better to leave than risk getting involved in an interaction.

Roadside drug testing might pick up substances other than Meth which are components of OTC meds. Being aware and speaking up if you have taken OTC meds and know what you have ingested. If in doubt and you are in no hurry opt always to have blood drawn at the Hospital. Chances are you will walk or drive away without the need.
 There is some anecdotal evidence however it is not that bad. WLs using Meth.

This is not a substitute for Medical or Legal advice.

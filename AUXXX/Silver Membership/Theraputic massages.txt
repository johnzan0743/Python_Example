Being more of a FS guy, I have absolutely no idea what is legally allowed in a therapeutic massage? Is tackle tickle allowed? A BJ, even a happy ending? I have no idea, could someone enlighten me please?

This relates to a review I was going to write then thought better of it until I know exactly what Council spies are looking for.

Absolutely anything is allowed' in a therapeutic massage, from oral sex to complete intercourse. It's just that most masseuses won't do it, and anyway it's illegal.

Problem is, this forum is based on reviews of a 'sexual experience'. Indeed, the absence of a sexual experience in a review does not qualify newbies for advancement.

It's a risk we all wear, with the downside varying from state to state. The common approach seems to be for Sydney (where I assume the OP will review) is that anything other than sucking and fucking is open slather.

Strictly though, Councils prohibit anything of a sexual nature as defined in law. This would include 'hand relief'. It might not include 'tackle tickle' for lack of 'emissionable' evidence... 

Our resident expert in these matters EvilGenius will no doubt have 'The Checkout' truth...

I have wondered why the 'declared' RnT establishments (e.g. BODYROTIC and Chrisindy's), as opposed to the ostensibly 'no sexual activity' or so-called 'legit' massage providers, are filed under 'Theraputic [sic] Massage Parlours' on this forum.  Is that their official status or do they in fact fall under the sex industry laws of their respective jurisdictions?  (I had assumed it was the latter.)  Also, are there regulatory distinctions between FS and RnT, since the more respectable providers are so strict to exclude the former and stick to the latter?

Just wondering...

Im unsure about the regulations pertaining to councils etc, however i do know that some councils make more of a "visible" effort to curb sudden outbreaks of sexual service shops springing up everywhere. Being seen to be try to do something is better than nothing at all, in their eyes i guess.

You are asking from a FS guy's perspective Seeto… i am coming from a Rnt perspective, as i don't visit FS parlours. But the haziness and "not knowing" what goodies are included in a particular ML's service is what feeds my curiosity and leads me to the punt. A lady who definitely gives massage, but only selectively gives extra services in that session, is to me, far more enticing than a lady who advertises the full list. All this behind closed doors and under guise of being a legitimate or non(or semi) sexual service adds to the haziness.

Looking back at this post, i may have gone off topic and onto something that has been discussed widely here. Apologies if so.

I could write a long story about this (and have earlier), but am using the phone at present.

Firstly the Therapeutic Massages section was previously known as R&T Massages (or similar). I imagine the name change occurred as a result of the media attention last year.

I see two parts to Seeto's question:

Q1: What is allowed in the shop?

A1: Unless it has a Council Development Approval as a brothel  Nothing sexual.

The law lumps masturbation in with sex as "prostitution".

The Summary Offences Act (Section 16 from memory) makes it a crime for:

-The lady to provide anything sexual

-The punter to ask for anything sexual

-The owner to allow anything sexual to happen

All with fines and/or prison time attached.

Of course, some shops 

Q2: What should be included in the Review?

A2: Apply discretion. I stop short of FS, but there are reviews in the massage section that mention FS.

To Lustvader:

Under NSW law, there is no regulatory difference between R&T and FS establishments. Places like Bodyrotic, Michelle's etc have brothel DA from the Local Council (which is why Bodyrotic moved from Five Dock to Camperdown).

As for why they are filed where they are  that is probably a legacy of the way the forum was originally organised. I did ask the question earlier, but apparently it is technically difficult to separate then now.

About 10 years ago, there was a shop at 650? George st, level 5 of the NAB building, the massage lady Susan was supposed to be a Chinese doctor . She gave a very good massage and she also advertised for treatment of "Impotence＂

Not that I had any issue on that department !

But I was curious so I went for a try, she was 40-50 yr old, totally unattractive , fully clothed, not much tits and no touching over clothes (which I found out later)!

The part I was as good as it gets (with undies on!) when she asked me to turn over, I didn't know what to expect. Before I knew it, she just strip my undies off and perusing my private part.

She did some massage and tickle tacking around the pubic area and I was rock hard!

Then she said: you are very strong, you have no problem! I thought, of course, now what?

She has one hand on my cock and said : do you want to eject out ? (Her exact words in Chinese!) I said yes thank you.

Then she proceeded to give me a pretty good handy ! When I was getting close I tried to grab her ass and she moved away, stared at me seriously and said : you can not touch me! Fair enough, and it didn't take long before I shot a big load! One of the very few times I had a HJ without touching any bare breasts !!

The massage was $60 for the hour, she didn't ask for any tips for the HJ , so I assumed it's included. But the massage was really good so I went back a couple more times, still a clothed HJ and no touching. 

On the next visit I saw an elderly Chinese man leaving as I arrived and then it all clicked . This is a senior's services and she really was helping old man to get it up and have some fun, it's a very noble community services!

Nothing sexual and certainly not illegal right ??

I wish one day when I was much older and I really have some problem down there, and not much money to punt, I could find another Susan who can help me out !!

This fascinating description by Lungor clearly demonstrates how the law is an absolute ass. Leaving BJs and FS aside, it also demonstrates how the "authorities" have no place even considering what goes on in a 'legitimate' massage shop where "hand relief" may occur, despite the letter of the law.

And after all, have we ever seen so much as a misdemeanour conviction for the administration of mere "hand relief"? I would imagine that the trained and authorised proprietor of a massage shop would vigorously defend the right to administer health practices that clearly fell within the gamut of their training... as no doubt is the case with most Chinese practice proprietors. This would include requested treatment for ED in such a practice.

Without referring to any 'other services' I know of one (at least) Chinese Physiotherapy practice that routinely offers hand relief. I would readily offer myself as a witness for the defence in the most unlikely event that the proprietor was to end up in court for pulling a dick as therapy.

All that aside... who on earth knows what goes on behind the closed door of a registered "Sex Therapist"...? And who 'polices' the 'sex police'?

Council snoops... fuck off and do some legitimate work. Stop wasting my rate payments.

I will now get off the soap box.

That seems to make sense on the face of it.  An HJ (or any form of sexual activity) between consenting adults hasn't been outlawed yet, so it should be OK.  As soon as money changes hands for the favour, it steps across the line and becomes prostitution.  

Of course, proving whether or not the HJ was factored into the cost of the massage could be tricky, but if every client who went in for a massage walked out with a dopey smile on his face (i.e. 100% of massages culminated in, well, cum), then the 'massage only' operator might have a case to answer I suspect.  

EvilGenius: many thanks, your post was very succinct and informative.

It's funny I saw an older Australian lady who was a certified massage therapist who was offering her services in the therapeutic section of the Local Gold Coast Bulletin's Classifieds section. Her full body massage included hand relief but it took a long trip down the coast to figure this part out as she was scared of telling me such on the phone. She explained to me that a full body relaxation massage is practically voided without the relief cause it leaves you on edge and with most therapists leaves you with blue balls. 

She was of the view that she shouldn't be pinged back by stupid classifieds regulations and this accordingly had shown in my phone conversation with her where all she could tell me was that she provided a great full body massage for $100 and that's it. Come to the hand relief it actually felt sensual as opposed to sexual, the way she played with it was actually relaxing, took her time with me, kept me on the verge for a while and then let me go. Whilst I would never want to have to defend one's practice, what I received from this lady was definitely nothing I've received before and I most certainly left very relaxed. 

Food for thought

"""



So far, there's no "license" for FS in NSW. To operate as a brothel, Council gives such approval to a Development Application. If a massage shop has DA approval to operate as a brothel, they probably advertise as such but... not necessarily. An example is 115 at North Sydney which only promotes as a massage shop despite having brothel DA approval. Service beyond massage is left up to the girls. But if the girls offer FS they are breaking no rules. I'd suggest this shop is a rare exception... at least on the north side. Shops with DA approval to operate as a brothel usually promote that fact... it's good business and the places we all know and love are very busy.

115 is the only such massage shop I can think of on the north side but there may well be others. There are others in other parts of Sydney... CBD & south siders can no doubt enlighten us. However, AFAIK, virtually all of the multitude of shops defined as "massage parlours" that we read about all the time on the forum are operating illegally at some level, in terms of the letter of NSW State law (i.e. ANYTHING sexual is defined as prostitution). That is the crux of the dilemma for this and other forums.

The law - as being 'broken' - is administered by Councils on the basis that a massage shop offering services of a "sexual nature" is simply operating outside of an approved DA. It requires someone to complain or bring to attention of the Council. That's where someone like Mr Seage comes in - supposedly as a defender of "the law" and "health standards". Except that he's merely peddling a financial interest for himself and the legal brothel industry. You would have to look long and very hard to find members of the public complaining that n@ughty deeds are being performed in a local massage parlour.

This is the story as I see it... if I'm wrong, no doubt someone with greater knowledge will correct me. However, one thing that intrigues me in EG's post is this bit:





			
				"The Summary Offences Act (Section 16 from memory) makes it a crime for: ............... -The punter to ask for anything sexual"............
			
		

While the distinction between 1). a punter asking and 2). an ML offering anything sexual may be obscure, this would suggest that huge chunks of this forum's content represent descriptions of "criminal" activity. While the Courts may be full for ten lifetimes should this be true and that matters were to be pursued, it does raise interesting questions for members here. It probably also raises questions for the forum itself... a reduction to reviews of simply 'legal sexual activity' would probably slash content to un-financial levels.

So, Seeto... I doubt your questions can ever be adequately answered so might as well simply join the masses who post about massage parlour activity... review and be damned... but yes, perhaps in gold if there are doubts!

As a footnote, I believe there has been a significant drop in review posts for massage experiences... certainly from more senior members who used to be more active. Maybe wrong and the 'statisticians' here may correct me again but a gut feeling... I just hope we don't end at the feet of a scaremongering, scurrilous media and their ratbag protagonists.

Prostitution (or sex work if you prefer) - ie when money changes hands - is not a crime in NSW. The laws surrounding the legality of it relate to where it happens ...

Indeed it could. In a place like Bodyrotic you pay your money to reception and their usual service (nude massage, bodyslide and happy ending) is provided. Even though they had a "shop policy" of no sex, Canada Bay Council and the Land and Environment Court determined that in their Five Dock premises were actually an "illegal brothel".

Here is a less succinct one I prepared earlier.






 Originally Posted by seeto

The short answer is: ....  There is no short answer (in NSW at least). Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a "licence" in NSW (unlike Victoria where they are issued under the Sex Work Act and must be displayed on the premises). There is simply a Local Council approval that allows commercial sex (or happy ending) to happen on the premises. There is no simple way of finding this out. Some Council's websites allow searching of the DA records based on the address, some don't. Those that do will show which places are approved (but only if the approval happened after the DA process was put online).

The other way of "knowing" is to look at where the shop puts its advertising. If it is in the "Adult Services" section of the paper, then it is probably approved as a brothel (but not guaranteed) - but if they are advertising as such, then I believe it is OK to review them as such. Sometimes the adverts include the DA number. But I have seen at least one case where the number was not the approval for the shop, but an approval for someone to build a swimming pool .... cheeky bastards 

Now, while I was typing this, Mr Hard posted his response. What he said are pretty much my thoughts as well. But I will post a list of places that advertise Massage but that I know actually have a DA to operate as brothels (or at least to legally offer a tug):

Pure Massage North Sydney (but not their Willoughby branch)
Bodyrotic,
Michelles/RPM/Nirvana
Mistys
Bliss on Crown
Spoilers in Crows Nest
Romeo's/Juliet
Masstige8
Midas
8 Railway Pde Burwood/Club 350 Chatswood
Sirs on Erskine St
Impressions
Kings Court
Chequers
The Bellevue retreat in Carlton

And no doubt some I have missed. I will not claim that as a complete or comprehensive list.

Gboat, true it will be 'safer' in gold section, but some of us who are discreet enough, don't yet have access to post there. So the dilemma for us in that category, links back to Hard's stat, that massage reviews may be dwindling because of the hesitation to post info that might either get the shop or particular ML in hot water. 

I guess the moles amongst us are indeed having an effect in some way.

Very unfortunately that would seem to be the case... to some extent. However, members can rest assured that between Admin, the Mods and senior members every stone is being turned in efforts to uproot the bastards.

But even something being up for 20 minutes that shouldn't, you just don't know who could see it in the small window.

 Not true. There is no requirement to post "illegal" or even adventurous material in reviews to access Gold. I suggest reading the requirements again.

As the moderators regularly repeat, there is a numerical requirement just to be CONSIDERED for Gold.

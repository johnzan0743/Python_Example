Hey guys im sorry if im gonna sound like a downer but i am not gonna try her until someone else tries her 1st. I am pretty new at this RnT game and all I want is to play it safe.

Also i have tried everything to search for reviews on her massage but to no avail

Seriously, if your main interest is really RnT, then a "legit" therapist, such as this lady appears to be, may not be the best choice. I'm sure she would be "safe" anyway 

I suppose the question for many who are new to the game might be... are you really seeking 'treatment' or just a good massage with some fun?

There's also the concept of TOFTT. You would be doing yourself a big favour to take a punt and write a review as a step forward to gaining access to the countless reviews available around this forum. Get past bronze and there's many miles of reading 

Good luck... and enjoy!

That's exactly right, xhadow. You've found an interesting (and to me at least, pretty hot looking) lady who appears to run a 'legit' business but where there is a very real prospect of receiving a happy ending. This is almost like the definition of playing it safe! And as hard advises, you have a great opportunity to build your forum cred by pathfinding for the rest of us.

Given her rate structure, I would jump in feet first and opt for the 90mins, given there's only a $20 difference between 75 and 90mins -- 30mins is too short for me, but since that is half the cost, that might be 'safer' for you to try as a first visit and scope things out.  To paraphrase her, even if orgasm doesn't happen in that time, you might still get a lovely relaxing massage.

Alternatively, there might be another Victorian member willing to explore their past lives through their lingam?  Like I said, I would be giving her a red-hot go for sure if I lived down that way.

In the Ad it says prices start at $100 for a 75min session. 

I have seen her Ad before. Anyone that advertisers Tantric Massage, would have to be dodgy. I would expect you will waste your money. There was another hot looking girl in Seaford that offered singing, with topless and the guy wasted $200 and no relief! https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f120/...83/#post214583

You have your answer here from the website:
"  This massage is an integrated massage as it also incorporates Kinesiology and Intuitive Healing as well. "

This massage is called Integrated Massage Therapy - it's a combination of Lomi Lomi, Tantric Healing and Massage, Kinesiology and Intuitive Healing. It provides deep healing and enlightenment, nurturing and pleasure and energetic awareness on so many levels it'll blow your mind! We're building the sexual energy in your body, unblocking the Kundalini along the spine (your core energy), awakening chakras, clearing any blockages, and dispersing that energy throughout your body. The idea is for you to receive 100% and prolong orgasm until you finally experience a full body energy release (orgasm). 

Specialising in sexual health, this massage is an amazing therapy for guys suffering from premature ejaculation or impotence. We're training the body to receive pleasure without jumping the gun, and also getting you out of your head (which is part of the problem). I also deal a lot with porn addiction, chronic masturbation or difficulty achieving orgasm...again we are getting you out of your head and connecting you with self. You cannot connect to the feminine if you're not connecting to self first. Message me for more information.

Prices start at $100 for a 30 min session. 75 and 90 min sessions available. Australian Practitioner. Shower facilities $5.
			
		

Definitely a lot of "New Age" stuff there which may or may not work for some people depending where an individual is on an emotional or spiritual spectrum. Yes, maybe even "crap" to many people! As previously mentioned, there's a need to consider why you would see such a practitioner instead of your typical suburban massage provider... with or without 'hand relief' or more. I'd also be a bit suspect about the "prices start.." which may indicate a deep pit into which to throw your hard-earned

New Locanto ad. She is now advertising Lingham massage.

http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_1...c-Massage.html






			
				My signature massage is called Integrated Massage Therapy. It's a combination of Lomi Lomi Massage, Tantric Bodywork, Tantric Healing, Intuitive Healing and Kinesiology.

Lomi Lomi is a hawaiian massage which means "loving hands". The style I do is the Ancient deep healing energy method, which shifts emotions and blockages and relieves all kinds of muscle aches and pains. 

Tantric Bodywork involves Lingam massage and is an energy based massage. It involves unblocking the Kundalini (core energy running up your spine), running the lines of energy up from your feet using Shakti (Mother Earth energy), unblocking and awakening all the chakras, and pulling blockages out of the spine and neck. We are then building up the sexual energy in the body and dispersing it to all parts of your being. The whole idea of this massage is for you to receive 100%. This is often difficult for most. I'm also educating you on what your body is capable of...im getting you out of your head and into your heart, and getting you to just FEEL. I'm trying to get you out of "porno world", so your eyes will be covered when you roll over. This is to awaken your other senses and to also take away your need for visual stimulation. 

This massage contains Lingam massage...once the sexual energy has been built up in the body and dispersed, it is then taken to the groin. There are various techniques of Lingam massage, and the energy is dispersed around the body again. Men store all their trauma and stress in their groin, as well as all their guilt and shame around sexuality and relationships. This massage releases all of that, as well as other emotions and blockages caught up in the body. 

The idea of Tantra is to prolong orgasm as long as possible, and breathing is a very important part of the massage, which you will be trained in at the beginning of your session.   

Specialising in sexual health, this massage is an amazing therapy for guys suffering from premature ejaculation or impotence. We're training the body to receive pleasure without jumping the gun, and also getting you out of your head (which is part of the problem). I also deal a lot with porn addiction, chronic masturbation or difficulty achieving orgasm...again we are getting you out of your head and connecting you with SELF. You cannot connect to the feminine if you're not connecting to self first. 

Although the goal is to give you a full body orgasm and facilitate a deep healing in the body, each person is different and the outcome is never the same, nor predictable. 

It is advised not to drink or eat immediately before a session, and to refrain from releasing any sexual energy 48 hours prior. 

Hours are:     
Mon - 9am to 3:15pm 
Tues - 9am to 6:00pm (or 8:00pm*)
Wed - 9am to 3:15pm 
Thur - 9am to 6:00pm (or 8:00pm*)
Frid -  9am to 3:15pm   
Sat - 10am to 5:00pm*

* every second week

Prices start at $100 and various session lengths available. 

Please text Catherine on 0401541571 as it's difficult to take calls during business hours.

"""



The words" If an orgasm happens" are typical "Tantra-speak".  It is common for ads for tantra massage to say things like "ejaculation is not the aim of the massage, but if it happens, it is a pleasant addition to the experience".

Of course orgasm is the aim of the massage.  The words are simply a disclaimer, a legal device to get around the laws regulating commercial sexual services, which are defined as defined as any action that has the aim of providing sexual gratification in return for payment.  Thus, a private show in which a paying customer masturbates while the provider strips and performs "indecent acts" on herself without actually touching the client, fulfils the definition of a "commercial sexual service".

The providers of tantric massage claim that they are not providing a sexual service by massaging the client's penis, since the aim of the massage is not to provide the client with sexual gratification, but is carried out for therapeutic purposes such as curing sexual problems such as impotence, premature ejaculation etc. The line is that if ejaculation does occur during the massage of the penis, it is purely an unintended side-effect.

Whether it would stand up in court is hard to know.  Lyell's statement that if orgasm occurs it is included in the price is also a legal mechanism; if she charges only for the massage, and does not charge an extra fee for the handjob, then she can argue that she is not receiving payment for a sexual act, she is just charging an unusually high fee for a legitimate massage.

It is ironic that the definition of "sexual act" in current Australian legislation, which aims to include all possible acts that end in sexual gratification for one or both parties to a commercial transaction, exactly mirrors the definitions in the Nazi "Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honour" which prohibited any sexual contact between Jews and Non-Jews.

I think you may be mistaken.  This is Catherine Lyell's Locanto ad:

http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_1...i-Massage.html

The ad you refer to is a different one, by someone called Foxy09.  It does not give any contact details, and may be a fake.

The questions asked by Catherine were probably just her trying to suss you out, to see whether you were genuine or not.  The fact that she is closing down (or has closed down) her operation called Integrative Men's Health Solutions may indicate that she has had some problems.  According to earlier versions of her website site she used to have other staff working with her, such as a hypnotist doing a quit-smoking program; they all seem to have disappeared now and she is operating alone.

Wwoman75 is definitely Catherine Lyell.  She gives her age as 41 and her location as Bonbeach.

Foxy09 gives her age as 35 and her location as Edithvale.  So there are differences between the two posters.

If Foxy09 is using a picture of Catherine, it may well be a fake ad, perhaps someone trying to cause trouble for her.

Why would a masseuse want a client's photo, and require manscaping?  It's the client's money she is interested in, not his looks.

If you read the post further up she asked a question like "Which country are you from?" Generally, if they ask for your photo, it means they don't want to see particular races and possibly certain age groups.

I can confirm that these two are the same lady. I have had PM from a long standing member, who wishes to remain anonymous , as this is very close to home for him and doesnt want to risk being identified should the shit hit the fan.

Some facts, she is actually 42, and operates from her home in Bonbeach. Business is not very good so she will suck cock but is extremely fussy about who she does it for, and requires you to contact her on KIK, send photos and wants your life history. Its about $200-250 a pop, and not all that good. His final thoughts were -  not VFM, and she can be very hard to get on with.

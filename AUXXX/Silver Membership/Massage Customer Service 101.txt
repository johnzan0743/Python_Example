 Massage Customer Service 101
				
Post Content: 
After several years of punting with many disappointments I have compiled a list of do's and don'ts that many ML's ignore or do not understand.maybe you can add to them or share some good or bad experiences?


When greeting customer, make it clear how much the massage will cost and who will be performing it. (no switcheroos);An hour massage should go for at least 55 minutes.not 35 minutes!!!;The customer should be asked what sort of massage he wants and if there are any particular sore spots (in addition to the obvious);A massage should be a continuous experience.NOT interrupted by phone calls or other ML's calling people to the front desk;ML's should wear appropriate clothing.NOT a suit of armour!!!A HE is not an opportunity to see how quickly you can jackhammer a customer out of the room. Clean room, sheets and towels are mandatory.

You forgot a few

8. Massage lady should wash hands and arms and if last customer had more contact should avail herself of the shower before commencing the massage. Paying extra attention to those well used parts.

9. A massage lady should not resort to using mechanical devices without express consent and permission.

10. Massage lasses should have a basic knowledge of anatomy and physiology or if otherwise state so and offer other services. This would save a shitload of time!

Likely plenty more but these 10 are a good start.

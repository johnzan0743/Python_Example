 Sydney RnTs or cheap Brothels near Capitol Sq CBD
				
Post Content: 
Hi, I will be in Sydney for a quick visit in a couple of weeks staying in a hotel near Capitol Sq Campbell/George st Sydney.
Hope to get away from fellow travellers to sneak out for a quick punt about 9pm.
Any intel on the places near this location within 10 to 15 minutes walking distance?
Prefer the cheaper places $70 nude RnT with HJ or F/S around $100, Asian girls preferred.
I have checked out a few on this forum that may be suitable but would still appreciate any feedback from the punters in the know.
Thanks

It's probably easiest to just check where you are on the map:

If you want to get around by foot from where you are staying, there are quite a few choices:

FS Shop: 429a Pitt Street, Wild Orchid, Cheap Asian shop

Around the same area: RnT shops at 374 (Apple), 376 (Silver Fox) and 378 (Posh) Pitt Street.

69 Liverpool Street (VIP 69) is also a cheap Thai B2B shop around the $60/$70 for 30 min nude HJ included.

Then you have a few along George St at 650 or 651 George St, 711 George is probably the one open till late.

All of the above shops have been reviewed, so you should be able to look up the corresponding addresses and get the phone number and check the opening hours too.

Have fun.

Cheers


PS.

Some of my favourite shops: 1B QVB, 741 Snow Lotus and 812 George and 227 Broadway are all worthy of visiting but you need to get there earlier, they probably will all be closed by 9pm.

late night rescue in Sydney (after midnight):

Babylon on level 2 Market City, Chinese RnT as well as Korean B2B, not cheap but it's a luxury place.

Masstige 8 on Harris Street - another 5 min from Market City, up market Korean shop

Thanks for helping him.  I have visions of Jerseybull being blindfolded at arrival in Sydney airport, driven out to any part of the CBD or surrounding area's, turned around a few times, then once blindfolded is off, told to start walking, wonder how long it will take him to stumble across his 1st rnt lol

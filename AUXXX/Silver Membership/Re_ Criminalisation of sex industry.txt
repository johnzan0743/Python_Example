Time to celebrate and give thanks. NSW government has rightly rejected the re-criminalisation of the sex industry and retained decriminalisation leaving the health and well being of sex workers in safer hands for the time being -  but still much to be done to obtain anti-discrimination protection and improve local government responses in treating sex industry land use equivalent to other like land uses and private workers as any other home occupation.

Would have just led the NSW police force to be even more corrupt than they are.

First I've heard of this, do we have an idea of votes, or who the sponsors/supporters of the proposal was? If' it's just Fred Nile doing his own thing we can relax, but if it's a 60:40 type thing something more needs to be done to ensure our way of life is protected.

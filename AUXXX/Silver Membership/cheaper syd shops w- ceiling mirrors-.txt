hey guys, ready for my next punt and was wondering if any of the cheaper sydney shops have them? I've been out to Guildford, down to Blakehurst, up to Hornsby and back down thru Willoughby, Roseville et al but am yet to enjoy the pleasures of that ceiling mirror view... Any intel would be greatly appreciated!

TP64 have mirrors on the ceiling.
They are not in best location on the ceiling, but you only need to move down on the Bed a little bit to get great views. 
Lying across the bed is also great. 
At times I wish that I had 3 sets of eyes.
1. To look at the Lady,
2. To look in the ceiling mirror.
3. To look in the large wall mirror.

 Enjoy. !!

Sheilal is correct about the ceiling mirrors at 64TP but I will add that in at least one of the old rooms at the back of the shop, the overhead mirror is perfectly placed.

Perhaps you could request a room back there.

Also, I've only been to Asians at Smithfield once so far but the room I was in had a great overhead mirror, perfectly placed.

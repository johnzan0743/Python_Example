My previous post here,
https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f113/...1-553-a-53950/

first time ever got a RnT here, it's one of those places boss doesn't allow it, individual WL does it. I don't want to ruin it for everyone if this becomes too widely spread, hence posting here in silver forum.

for those forum regulars want to know more, please PM me, I will provide details.

please don't contact them directly and ask for RnT on phone or via text.

Have you got an interest in this place Beyond ? Lol.
The giveaway that is the sign that an Asian MP is rarely legit is its opening hours. Especially in the ACT.

Most legitimate places finish before 8pm in the evening. The 10pm or later closing time is usually one of the giveaways.

There are always exceptions however another giveaway is having therapists of a different nationality working in the place. Thai massage places can be manned by Caucasians but rarely is this ever the case.
But the giveaway here is the other Asian nationality aside from Thai. So Beyond you are spot on with your observations there.

Mostly anyplace that employs ladyboys is so far from legit it needs public transport to reach it. Read yeahhh!!!

So perhaps the Politics and public service is not the mainstay in CannedBrrrrraaa. But I think there are many gems in the ACT where you can get your tackle tickled or teased without the shroud of secrecy.
The thing is I am wondering what the obsession is about this seemingly ordinary Thai Massage Joint?

Is this some kind of secret code? Just saying.

Despite advertising that they are open 7 days a week, they were not open this afternoon when I popped by to check it out....they will go broke soon because they are off the beaten track and there are several other places nearby, some of which guarantee HE

Hey SR, thanks for your reply. You seem to know a lot more about tie place than i do, which is great also means I won’t be much help. I been a regular of this place for legit massage as it’s price is really cheap. Hence wanted to share about a recent difference experience that’s all. I know there are plenty places to go for HE or more. I am just happy to share with anyone who is interested in something different.

No problem BeyondK. I guess there is some merit to the argument inside these places that goes something like this.
If a client is happy and returning for a massage without adult services nurture the client and don't offer any extras. Clients who attend regularly are always welcome without complications for management.
Reason being management only receives their cut of the money paid and they have little interest in the extras income.
This is the case for a lot of AMP's hence most enjoy an environment free of coercion. It's that simple really.

Wasn't having a go at you Beyond aside from the tongue in cheek.

SR.

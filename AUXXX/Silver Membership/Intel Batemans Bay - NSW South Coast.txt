There is a lady who is up for all sorts in Narooma. Had a massage and she said that was all she offered but had a clandestine conversation with her and she was offering virtually anything goes but not cheap. I let it go as I was more interested in the bird in the hand as opposed to the one in the bush. However she has a checkered past. Put it this way she made it to the newspapers for being out there.

 If anyone wants to risk it happy to supply further details. She has a great rack but is on the mature side but does an excellent remedial massage. She is rather slim darker skinned olive rather than dark pigmented.
She works out of a motel come cheap stay accompanied where she lives.

Plus side is she appears flexible downside is she is unpredictable.

Reply to this thread if you wish to get further details.

Unfortunately the Why Knot shop in Rowen's Arcade Ulladulla is quite legit and I have never had even a hint of extras. I'm not aware they have a second shop in Ulladulla though, where is it?

As far as Bateman's Bay goes, there's the little Chinese RNT in the small shops on the corner of Beach Road and Corrigan Crescent. The one time I've been there the woman was large and unattractive, although ready for anything, but not my cup of tea!

Same place I posted the number for.

Over a cpl summers of coastal trips,  found this to be reliable both for an ok/good ‘massage and ok/good. hj.

Usually by a ‘fuller figured’  late 40’s plus Chinese woman. For those Spanish  lovers , DD’s though I’ve never thought to ask. 

Occasionally other staff , are rotated there. All  late 40’s plus . Once quite an attractive Chinese woman dressed very well though clearly new. I was told this during the session. Ended in her been in the room also for some schooling. I got impromptu though average 4 -hands . She got a lot of giggles and guidance 

Only once an early 30’s woman. Again Chinese. average massage . Was Offered FS by her and urged to DATY. I declined. 

YMMV Otherwise all clothed or semi clothed  $30/50 hj

Coffeectound the corner on Beach RD. Really good

So they've taken it over from the woman from Nowra? That must have been fairly recent, as the last time I was there it was still the old owner.

Hey chaps.
The massage place at Batehaven shops is good. Was there Before Xmas 2017. I have a review here somewhere about it.
It was a year ago..so...but from memory the HJ was pretty good.
There were one or 2 full service girls but from memory at the time they were on holidays. Nothing on AMM and not much on Seeking form memory or Locanto.
Thought I would add my 2 cents as I was a regular down to Narooma for over 10 years once or twice a year so know the scene quite well....not that there is once

So much for the South Coast Intel. An oxymoron. It appears to be.

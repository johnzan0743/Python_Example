Thanks

Eva at Summerville Massage Pyrmont. She used to run her own part time shop in Bondi junction doing waxing/beauty stuff only and doing RnT at Summerville, if you book her at Summerville and let her know you want to have waxing as well, you'll get both services .

Cheers

I know some here don't regard transsexual women as women, but Kim in Newtown does waxing and also gives a great handjob ( and more if you're into that) I've only done crack and sack but she does all areas of the body. Has a little studio setup in her apartment. http://sydney.backpage.com/Transsexu...er-now/5825811

There's a place on Clarence st near Town Hall that I can't remember the name of. I'm sure if you go for a walk you'll see it.

I rang Mia and she quoted $80 for Brazilian - a reasonably competitive price I guess, but I have been spoiled with a $50 rate at the place I used to go on the north side. You said an extra $20 for 20 min massage. Does that include a tug???

Many thanks mate. Tried her out this week and she did a very efficient waxing job, taking young Bill firmly in hand (and ensuring he stayed firm as well), followed by a lovely HJ. Total $80 plus $50. Will try to get topless thrown in next time (hopefully at the same price)

Came across a post on another site for a place on Victoria Park station advertising massage and waxing. After ensuring that they were bona fide (eg use hot wax), I booked and headed in today. Tina, a young a nice enough young Vietnamese lady, works Sunday Wednesday and Friday and, she reported, l was trained in waxing in Melbourne. I have been to a number of waxing professionals and she certainly very skilled in her art (Thanks Gold - I wouldn't like to trust my bits to an amateur). On the other hand - as suited for what is clearly a dodgy AMP - she was quite happy to be greeted with young Bill at full attention (thanks to a previously application of blueys) and to take him firmly in hand though the next 30 minutes.

When all was done and the last stray hairs tweezered away, she cleaned me up with a generous amount of oil and a polite request as to whether there was anything else ..... We agreed on $30 and she proceeded with a very nice - and practiced - two handed twister which finished me off in the finest of style. On investigation, I found a very fine of C-cups tucked away under her tee-shirt, but she declined any suggestion of extra to reveal them -pity. 

Anyway, should waxing be on your bucket list, you could do much worse than to visit Tina.

What a pity you have not written an official template review of this place so our members could try it as well, especially after the last sentence!

A further update on the wax + HJ (plus more in this case) front (in Melbourne), I can highly recommend Wendy at Star  Therapy, 771 High St Thornbury.

Full Brazilian with full contact attention to young Bill which kept him (and me) happy throughout, followed by a happy ending with FIV, DATY and HJ for $120 all up. Wendy is probably around 50 but with a very impressive body and a very nice lady.

Time for another trip to a nice AMP for waxing the undergrowth. This time, I made the trek out to the base of the Dandenongs to pay a visit to 

Magic Therapy（massage&waxing）
AEC Arcade, 2/224 Dorset Rd · 0410 458 851

The nice and accommodating waxing lady there is Lucy, short, 40's, quite OK looking and pleasant company.
Waxing was first rate, using hot wax and spatula and done very efficiently. The upside is that she is fully "hands-on" and, once we had passed the "where did you find out about us, what shops did you go to before" stage. she added enough saucy talk "he nice size" etc, to keep young Bill fully attentive through the work on the front. Then (God bless her) she said "you need any massage". "Maybe just a little" I said, placing my hand on her arse. "Here?" she asked (rhetorically). "That cost extra". I nodded OK and she was away with a very nice hand job and ball massage. A little tweaking of the (fully covered) arse and titty was enough to gave me over the top in a few minutes. 

All up, a very reasonable $85 ($55 for waxing; $30 extra). First rate value and a very nice old bird. A bit far for me to have on regular rotation but I will be back again when I am up for a trip.

Just went back to Clouds (Clayton) for a great wax'n'tug. The wax (sack 'n crack) was $60 and I offered the change ($40) for a really nice finish from (works Saturday and Monday). This is my third visit and third different lady - all Vietnamese, all pretty good waxers all quite happy to remain "hands on" through the process and perfectly happy to offer transition smoothly into a tug.

The good thing is that they offer a real "wax 'n tug" service where the tug is a natural extension of the waxing. By the time they do the cleanup with lotion at the end of the waxing, I am chubbed up and ready for a tug. Some places annoy me by trying trying to start a new (massage) session, for which they want to charge - plus the extras.

 Thai remedy?
				
Post Content: 
I was curious if anyone has tried Thai Remedy in Balmain or the new shop in Pyrmont? Or at least, been lured in by the language used in their ads posted on locanto, and previously, gumtree.

I visited the Balmain shop early this year, based on the 'sensual' offerings. When I arrived, the girl didn't even know what sensual meant. I tried another girl weeks later, same deal. But, two weeks ago I see an AD using the line 'New Thai girl in Sydney' for the Pyrmont shop.

In short, anyone had an interesting experience in either shop?

You could offer to teach her the meaning.... by putting your dick in her hand 

Plenty of girls don't know the language but they sure know why they're there

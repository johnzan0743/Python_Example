Post Content: 
Gents, just a quick word regarding members replies to reviews submitted in the New Members Section by Registered Users. We are getting an increasing number of replies to these reviews, so if you have posted there and you're wondering why you cant see your post, here is the reason. 

This section of the Forum is for prospective new members to submit their 2 reviews to be considered for free membership. Replies from members of Bronze level and above are automatically hidden in this section. Most of the replies from our members are very helpful, usually offering information left out of the reviews by the poster, or answering in response to a Moderators request for a name, a phone number or a link etc...

Most of the time we are aware of these missing details and could add them ourselves, but for education purposes we ask the new members to supply the details themselves. It helps them understand what is required to be included in their reviews and gives us an idea if the person is prepared to put in the effort of writing a complying review.

Also please remember if you are answering their questions, these people have registered on the Forum but are not members yet.

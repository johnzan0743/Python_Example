 Silver members posting reviews in the Bronze Lounge
				
Post Content: 
We have had a spate of Silver member Massage Parlour reviews being posted in the Bronze Lounge over the last few weeks. 

Please do not post reviews there - its for Bronze member reviews only. 

The problem seems to be when the only thread to be found for a shop is in Bronze and the new reviews are being added to it. If the only thread to be found is in Bronze, please start a new thread in the Massage Parlour section of the General forums.

I just posted a review in the Bronze section and THEN noticed I'd been upgraded to Silver - sorry. That's where I was used to posting and I was replying to a thread that got me to visit a certain place.

No worries - fixed.     I will move all your bronze reviews to the main forum in a day or so.

I posted a review on 375B Springvale Road, Springvale. Should I have posted it in Silver section by starting a new thread?
Cheers

Not by starting an new thread.    It should have been added to the existing thread in Therapeutic Massage Parlours.   I moved it there at the time.

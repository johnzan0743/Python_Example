 This is an example of why you do not show reviews to workers.
				
Post Content: 
Below is an example of why you do not show workers reviews.

This started with a horrific experience for a punter at the hands of a what i can only assume is an unstable working lady. 

He gave a negative review of his experience with the working lady.

Some not too intelligent punter then shared the review with this WL.
What was his motivation to do so???

The WL in question then signed up and started making distasteful posts before her posts and account were removed.

Now the emails start arriving, below you will see the total dialogue.

Here are her emails.

My name is ??? ??? im a private upmarket worker and have joined up as a very dear regular notified me of the disgusting comments made by someone on this site.
Pls read what has been said about me and understand that false revolting reviews such as this can be made by nasty workers who are jealous of me or clients who didnt get what they wanted eg illegal services or one of the many men who run illegal asians and try to ruin our business.
What has been said about me by this person/ persons is illegal and untrue and it reeks of someone trying to ruin my business I want all posts regarding my name and telephone number taken down immediately if it is not done within 24 hours i will go to the police i register with and the APL and seek legal advise I am furious complete strangers can write our names and numbers and this sort of rubbish

I will actually be going to the police regarding this psycho firstly i do not and never have done a natural service of any kind and secondly this psycho did not ever come into my room and do any of those things he said he has done as i would have called the police immediately. I have never accepted $50 from any client and never would i start from $200 half hr. This individual is a sick sad nasty little man but your site has allowed him to damage my business. I am beyond shocked and disgusted and want my name and number and these outrageous lies and deliberate intent to harm my business stopped. He should be banned from your site he has already stated he has texted me over 300 times on disposable sims so that should be a start for the police to intervene. Nothing this revolting person has said about me is true and i see no reason you should be allowing this disgusting stuff to appear on this site. ??? ???

My Response.

Hello ??? ???,

You know what?

The behaviour you are now displaying is exactly the same as your review history since 2013 across all the adult forums.
I have not found one decent review of you.

A good lesson in life that you should learn is if you want something from somebody then be nice to them.

If you want somebody to help you and you come out guns blazing and making threats, you know what?
I just think here we go again, another nutbag. I have seen it all and heard it all before.

Be my guest going to the Police. We very strictly adhere to the ADMA regulations.
This is a review forum. One bad review may be sour grapes or a malicious attack. 
Many bad reviews over many years across many adult review sites form a pattern of how you choose to run your business.
Feel free going to your lawyer, we are doing nothing wrong.
You will then also have to take down at least 5 other review sites that  contain similar reports of how badly you treat your customers.
If you have the money go for it!

Maybe a smarter approach from you would be to read the reviews.
If the reviews are all the same from many people on many websites then I  would suggest that you take the complaints on board. Work on them and  profit from the many happy customers you may now gain.
Along with new & happy customers positive reviews will follow.

I have given you free advice, how you choose to use this advice is up to you.

I do not appreciate the many distasteful emails so am now blocking your email address

Regards,

Support

Very well conducted... I don't envy the job of Admin or a moderator in this business.

For recent members reading this thread, a look HERE might be well worthwhile to further reinforce the folly of discussing reviews with any industry worker, whether shop, parlour, PWL or PML.

As can be seen above, even with those workers who advertise and might be expected to benefit from publicity, any review showing/discussion can go seriously pear-shape.

I have seen some stupid guys not only mention reviews and forums, but actually showing them during the booking. I remember reading a few reviews like that on a rival forum. Did I mention stupid? Taking it one step further is asking for approval before posting their review. Then it also becomes biased as well!

And as one who's been burnt before by someone showing one of my reviews of a PML to her trying to get extras off the back of my experience, this is sad to see.  It's incidents like this that make me now second guess about posting reviews and reading and rereading to make sure I cannot be identified easily from said review.  Hats off to the mods and admins who have to deal with this stuff behind the scenes due to the stupidity of others.

Similar experience Drizzt,

A long time ago i reviewed a new private girl on another site and another member used it to his advantage and her disadvantage. I subsequently removed it and in the meantime he got banned from this site for trying to deter others posts about her. I came to my senses and blocked the idiot as he kept asking me about how far I'd got with her.

I hung up my punting pen for a while after that; i wanted to write fresh reviews not add to the bulk of over-reviewed places.

This site is well monitored and maintained, and it's good to get the cap off the pen again.

I do wonder though, some prominent brothels that take pics of their girls and also paste punters' reviews of them on their webpages... Surely the girls know of this and can see reviews of themselves on there?

Brothels v Parlour and Private is a different kettle of fish though of course. 

Loose lips sink Ships.

Good point, I was pondering the desirability or otherwise of that practice as well. At least a couple of my reviews (that I am aware of) have been reproduced, in whole or in part, on parlours' websites. The reviews obviously were positive and did not divulge anything that is not sanctioned by the respective shops, so I suppose no harm done in that respect. But it does make me think twice about the level of detail to include in future if there's a risk they will be made readily available outside this forum.

The issue of showing reviews is possibly less risk for brothels where WLs are likely to be aware of some level of advertising... they may or may not read reviews but the brothel management is something of a buffer.

I've had reviews reproduced on shop websites. I've had reviews solicited by a mamasan (for absolutely no benefit to me). I have no idea whether the girls read them or not. I don't discuss reviews with WLs or MLs full stop.

I had one review apparently result in a shop changing a girl's name because they didn't like the fact that there was a reported brief BB episode during a session... the girl's sudden, unexpected action I might add. Presumably, the shop was sensitive so they just changed her name to 'apparently' withdraw the girl from the roster. But as it was her choice there was no need to dismiss her. So be careful what you choose and how you report it...

The biggest risk is massage parlours. At their discretion, some girls offer extra services for loyal patronage &/or because they like and trust you. But to then receive grief as a result of a review, either from shop management, Council or fuckwit punters discussing reviews is where major problems arise. Equally with a PWL who self-manages. There is no buffer from anywhere and such a worker ends up at the mercy of reviews. If personal ID is likely to be an issue, 'controversial' content can be minimized by delayed posting the review. That's not to say you don't call it as you see it... but always stop and think about how the girl may have felt, i.e. RESPECT. WLs are not fools and it never ceases to amaze me just how much they remember about you... often months later. If in doubt, leave it out or put in gold if accessible.

It's a golden rule of punting and reviewing. Do not ever discuss reviews, especially as some sort of lever or power trip. This forum takes a dim view of punters who transgress to the obvious detriment of a WL. Equally though... as the OP shows... this goes both ways. Even punters have rights, as long as respect is maintained

Soooo..... what a coincidence that this is a topic of discussion right now.

A PWL/PML i visited today has been shown her reviews from at least this site by one of its members. She mentioned this site by name and referred to something in one of the reviews. Though she wasn't referring to anything negative, it still indicates that the cardinal rule is being broken. I don't understand the motivation behind showing girls reviews or the forum.... do you think you're being a "friend" to them? Get over yourself.

Anyway, now that i know she has access, i find it hard to be objective in my review because i don't want awkward situations with her if there is a next time round.

For that reason, when i write it up, it will be posted in Gold, even though the review belongs out in the PWL section, as that is where the thread referring to her is located.

Sometimes I have mentioned that I review escorts during a punt to get a better punt. If the punt is going well I do not say anything but often if it is not going well I mention it and often the service increases drastically. Perhaps this punter was doing the same but happened to come across someone obviously mentally unstable. For the record I am currently taking a long break from punting hence my break from reviews (before I get told off). I do not envy mods....thats for sure. You guys do a great job

I punt almost exclusively at massage places and a couple of times review sites have come up. My reaction is always "on the internet? really?" and deny all knowledge. Very dangerous area indeed. I can't imagine many MLs would actually like reviews being posted period. Some mamasans might but your average massage lady would hate it I think. Not that I go around asking of course, but you get an impression from when it comes up from time to time. My advice would be to steer well clear.

Maybe this is your practice jamesjl. However it gives rise to the very difficulties that are being discussed on several threads right now.

Suggesting a favourable review "to get a better punt" is coercion and frankly, a form of harassment. THIS THREAD deserves another read...

Some workers know full well about sites like this, last punt I had the lady asked me if I'd "read review on internet". I laughed. I've never mentioned reviewing a girl ever, if a girl asks me where I heard about her I usually just say I read about her on the roster. I think with some of the more popular FS places the girls know about all the reviews because their shops use said reviews while advertising the ladies on their roster.

One girl asked me the same thing one time, after I made a blind booking. "Did you come from the internet?"

You **always** need to know where she advertises.  Then the answer is easy - I saw your add on wherever it was.  Beyond that, if she pushes the point, Megamaid nailed it - just look blankly at them and feign ignorance asking "where???".  Let them go on their rant if that's what they need and then say you don't know anything about them.  Works for me anyway

This girl is a brothel worker she doesn't advertise. She travels from brothel to brothel using the same name. I knew where she was working because guys kept posting where she was followed by a rave review. 

I went there and went through the intro process, didn't see her intro, but booked her regardless going on all the reviews I had read. Obviously many other guys had done the same and when we both looked at each other she asked straight out "I have never seen you before. Did you come from the internet?" 

She started going on about review sites and guys booking her, without meeting her! Then started going on about her husband and how they have split, because he read the reviews. What could I say? I said she should change her name if it bothers her and straight away she said guys will tell everyone online anyway!

Some girls do use reviews to their advantage and make the most of the increased business. This one had a bad attitude about being found on the internet. I would never again book any girl without meeting her first and never admit I know about review sites!

She wasn't what I expected from the reviews I had read.

Had a ML ask me a little while back if I did reviews - I just stared at her blankly and asked her what she meant? She then went on to explain that a punter had seen a review and asked for more than the normal service i.e. FS, She had given the regular.

I had seen this lass a couple of times and I think she was feeling me out on it. Not that I had been given the additional extras she talking about. She seemed pretty horrified that this had been shared. I am pretty sure this would screw up the regulars next punt.

Just goes to show that while sharing on this or any other punting site you need to be careful of what you share- can't trust the trolls.

Unfortunately there are guys on all sites I guess who get their rocks off by bragging about any extras they receive. The best policy is always to describe that part that you believe to be the ML's standard service and leave the extras for others to earn themselves. Punting is often like an iceberg, there is a lot that may be hidden below the surface and not seen until you explore yourself (yeh, I know, probably a terrible analogy but the the best I can do after a long days work and a couple of beers!)

I think it is this aspect that can encourage the smarter forum users to climb the ladder... to rise above the mass membership who mostly seem only to take as much as they can but give zip back.

It goes further than that - guys who get their rocks off claiming they received extra when nothing was given. Either because of what an excellent fuck they are or because they are super nice guys etc. Essentially big noting themselves.. we have no way of proving either way. The props given on other forums for "obtaining" extras is.. weird.

Reviews (imo) should be along the lines of 1) do pictures match (when dealing with cracker, etc) 2) What is she like - looks/personality 3) does service given match what is on offer in the ad (eg, dfk listed but withheld) 4) is service enthusiastic/fun or plastic/forced 5) location/premises. 

Am I missing anything?

Even then it becomes difficult because we have no frame for what the reviewer is like. For example if a dude reviewed three girls who offer bbbj at their discretion in an advert and do not give to him what are we to think when he complains?

You can read all sorts into a situation like that.
I'd assume the first that came to mind would by hygine, however it could just be the punter was young  and the WL may have feared he may Blow in her mouth, I have found the promise of not blowing in her mouth is often a prerequisite to getting a WL to provide BBBJ over CBJ. 

Or perhaps she had a sore throat and didn;t want to risk giving the punter Non Specific Urethritis .

Too many variables to read anything out of from a single punter

Hi Hard - I feel the same way. I was a regular AXR reviewer but was recently targeted by a WL who accessed this site and took offence to one of my reviews (of her - which was actually quite positive). She sent me emails with identifying information about myself and also posted to this site. 

To their very great credit the Mods took care of it promptly and sympathetically but the whole experience has left me gun-shy about posting new reviews to what is essentially a public Forum. All this WL needed to do was pay for access and she was on board. I would consider posting to a more private Forum though, but I haven't managed to climb higher than Silver yet.

You could read a lot into that... or a little. In my experience, it comes down to one simple word. RESPECT. Behaviour will demonstrate whether a punter understands respect... WLs and MLs can spot it faster than anyone writing a review later on here.

It is so obvious when reading the ever-varying reviews on any forum. Particularly in a MP, the guys who get the goods are the guys who treat women with respect. It shows in the reviews. Generally, more mature-minded guys will get benefits because they've been around long enough to realize that treating women as a 'fucking whore' or a lump of meat will get very little, except perhaps from an all-out porn queen. In the case of MLs, they are primarily there for massage... anything extra is discretionary. Yes, even a simple tug. Those blokes who rock into a MP believing it's their god-given right to shove their uncovered cock down a girl's throat are totally deluded. Respect brings reward... not some aggressive demand based on "my mate got his cock sucked..."

So, perhaps contrary to some perceptions, with a few contributions it's pretty easy to make an assessment of "what the reviewer is like". The person tends to come out in the writing style. Those who always 'gild the lily' can be pretty easy to spot... equally the aggressive assholes who demand the world and complain when they get denied.

Generally, more mature-minded guys will get benefits because they've been around long enough to realize that treating women as a 'fucking whore' or a lump of meat will get very little, except perhaps from an all-out porn queen. In the case of MLs, they are primarily there for massage... anything extra is discretionary. Yes, even a simple tug. Those blokes who rock into a MP believing it's their god-given right to shove their uncovered cock down a girl's throat are totally deluded. Respect brings reward... not some aggressive demand based on "my mate got his cock sucked..."

So, perhaps contrary to some perceptions, with a few contributions it's pretty easy to make an assessment of "what the reviewer is like". The person tends to come out in the writing style. Those who always 'gild the lily' can be pretty easy to spot... equally the aggressive assholes who demand the world and complain when they get denied

@ Hard, mate you said it all in one. Respect no matter on the initial contact is important, seen some girls that at 1st they where hard as nails, but once they seen you where a gentleman & had respect there shields where lowered into a great session. 

While I review alot of girls, I have with held some simply because of the incident that happened to me..........Its a shame but there is and always will be members of any forum no matter what its about to spoil it for the 99% who are genuine.

There is no god given right to anything. Especially from an ML. All the extras I've received have come from shy girls with solid effort building a relationship and investing in a good session FOR THE TWO OF US!

And you know what. You can be a fucking rock star or whatever, if the girl isn't feeling the mood or she might be having a bad day, then you'll just have to RESPECT THAT and accept what's given.

Unfortunately we have had to suspend a Silver member from the Forum today. He had shown a review thread to a ML and we suspect others, but the member chose to ignore requests from Moderators to give his side of the story and clear himself.

It is sad when it comes to this, but the fallout affects everyone involved. The ML involved in this has now moved on thus losing her income,  the member responsible has lost the services of the ML and his membership here, and the Admin/Mod team is left to clean up the mess.

No one wins out of showing reviews to ladies. If you are thinking that it might be a good idea to do this to score points or whatever with a lady remember this.... Dont do it! It WILL come back to bite you.

I'll add my two cents to this.

Do you go up to a girl you know and say "my friend told me he had sex with you" - implying you also are able to have sex with her?

Just because money is involved with working ladies, doesn't mean you will get something someone else has. That's called business. It's not a McDonalds menu.

I was talking to a WL yesterday who works in a FS shop near Parramatta. I was very surprised when she brought up a recent review that I had done on her services,  fortunately a good review. She asked me about the site and I did not say much but she did say that mycomments were very complimentary. I asked her how she found out and it was from another customer, again I am lucky that I have known this Wl for many years and she did not take offence.
She then told me that the other customer had also told her about another punt that I had with a private Wl at Olympic Park and I had also reviewed. Again I told her that it was disappointing that the other customer would choose to share this information with her and that it was unethical for that person to discuss with her.
As I have known this lady for so long she was unfazed by the situation as she knows me and has a deep affection for me. The customer even told her my site user name.
I am very sure that I know who the "customer" was and I do not fully understand his motivation for doing this. I also know that he is not a junior member, far from it. I am hoping that he will read this and send me a PM to explain his actions.
I was tossing up whether to send this to mods as a PM but I would like to give the person the opportunity to explain themselves first.
Again we need to reinforce the need to not discuss any matters pertaining to this forum!!!

Notwithstanding Rayo's admirable offer to the individual to explain himself, my view is the matter should be placed with the moderators ASAP.  Arguably this is their raison d'être.  By handing this matter to the mods a consistent and more fully formed resolution is likely.  

If this is true as reported, then in my view, the person should be banned from the forum.

This has been instructive. I recently began posting a few ARs again (to see how it goes) after having been quoted chapter and verse a couple, or so, years ago, and questioned by MLs.  and more!!! (One girl's boyfriend got my mobile number for @@&&XX purpose??) So I went underground, I had no fear, I knew who he was, but I did not need his "acclaim" 

There are quite a few shops I have never posted ARs on, and many girls, and never will.

So I guess we all run our own "censorships" to some extent, or completely, on whom we will share with, or not. I must admit I was not really aware of the Gold Member "forum". I understand now some limited comments I have observed. 

For now I am just rolling with it.

I get your point, understand if my action dont sit well with you or any other member. 99% of my punt I happily review.

The only review that I never post was a semi WL working from her actual resident. She was only doing escorting temp and was very choosy with her client. Heck she even ask for an id pic the first time i met her. She only lasted no more than 2 months as one punter nearly out her out to the neighbour when she refuse to perform a certain act. She is now working a normal office job.

I was nailed by a mamasan a year or so ago because of a review I had put up about her massage.     She had access to the site and recognised the review as about her.      She said she did not want reviews of her establishment posted and asked me to desist.      I still visit that establishment, see mamasan and have not reviewed that establishment since.

I took the question of her access to the mods at the time and the conclusion was she must have access to a "normal" ID.     The solution was to post in Gold.    I posted my experience in Gold at the time.

Another example why the choicer reviews should be in Gold.

It's not that hard to find out there has been a review. If you google search a place and name a list of reviews come up. That's how I found out about review sites.  

With AUXXX you can pay to join, other forums just join and you can see all the reviews. Girls talk and know about review sites. That's why some change their names and move around. It's no big secret. 

The main problem here is punters who use reviews to gain points with the girls. I call it blackmail to get better service, or a threat to post on forums. 

When you only have a small amount of time in a booking, you don't want to waste time talking about negatives. It sure isn't going to improve the service.

If you don't want to get pointed out as a reviewer there are steps you can take. Don't post really personal details. Especially if you see her often. I try not to post straight after a session, unless I won't be back!

One particular girl on say locanto knew i gave her 5 stars, she had another with 3 stars and knew who it was, said he was a ass & never listened to her request, where with me I listened & the session was great. So sure there is always 2 sides to every review that is not great.

I agree with foreman, I believe most of these girls know about reviews. I've had a situation where I have the private number of a wl, I have reviewed this lady a few times, and unfortunately due to my situation at the time, it would have been very easy for her to identify me if she were to read it. We have become quite friendly outside of the bedroom, contacting each other fairly often.
Now a while ago, another member from this forum, who has since been banned. Also visited this wl. He thought it was a great idea to not only talk about the forum, but to log on with his phone during a session, and show her! Fkn arsehole. 

I'm not sure exactly how, but her and the other wl's at this establishment, now regularly log onto this forum to have a look. I don't know if he gave her his log in details or not, but she has told me that this is what they do.
So obviously she found my reviews of her, luckily for me they were very flattering, but she was quick to contact me and berat me for it. Her side of the story is, her as a wl has no right of reply, sometimes two people don't click , some guys are disgusting etc. She also said a large majority of the things written about her and her services, we're grossly exaggerated.

Well said tripod.

Just to add a bit more on the top of what you already said, the problem in this situation is that the WL thinks the bigmouth is the "good guy" by showing them the reviews. But these bigmouths know that women love gossip, so they manipulated WLs by showing them reviews in exchange of getting some brownie points. But these selfish cunts don't realise the damage they are doing - it reduces the number of reviews, it can damage punters relationship with WL and it can put punters identity at risk. In one case a punter showed the reviews to a WL whose, unintentionally or not, spoke out the reviewer name and where he works. So by then you can imagine how shitty this ended up: the bigmouth member harassed the other member through pms: "I know your name and where you work "...

Luckily the bigmouth member was banned.

Silence is golden at times. Less is more. All those other relevant sweeping clichés.

I had a few points to the above. Some girls are able to determine who wrote a review about them, without being showed by an unscrupulous punter. Many girls know about review sites and can sometimes work out who that punter was. This is what happened to brauniac recently. I also know another punter who was singled out, because of his detailed reviews. Now his reviews have dropped off to virtually nothing!

It is a tricky one. I got burned by a WL, that I knew nothing about, apart from a few reviews on her. Name withheld. I booked her sight unseen. 

When she met me, she quizzed me and said 'have I seen you before?, because you don't look familiar'. I lied and said,  'a friend recommended her'. It turned sour in the room and she said 'I hope you don't believe the reviews because most of those guys are full of shit & claim I do all sorts of things, which are untrue, so don't expect it to be like that OK?', she then left me to shower. When she returned I decided to fess up. I am a shit liar anyway. I said, 'look I had read some reviews of you'. I told her how the shop was quite far away from where I live and because I had a bad time with a girl one time who did not suit me.  I decided to make sure I chose a girl that would suit me by getting a bit of information first. All true, so I wasn't lying. As the session went on she started to warm to me. By the end of it we had a great time. She even offered her number. I tried to build the rapport by saying that I will come and see her another time and if she felt comfortable with me, she could give me her number then. I might add, it worked. She is a really hot girl too. Better to tell the truth I reckon. Unless you're a good liar.

Another time I told a WL about a review I had read and that is why I saw her. This WL, openly told me she has an account with a certain forum. She was fine with it, as she claims she gets many clients from the forum. So sometimes, it is dependant on the WL. But as a rule now I don't book someone sight unseen. If I have seen them in an intro, I will mention that I saw them in the intro and came back for them. Never had a problem since being straight with them.

Whenever a private lady's review makes me want to visit her, the first thing I do is to Google her mobile number which will bring up her advertisements.  I can then truthfully tell her that I saw her ad in Backpage, Private Girls or wherever.

A little more problematic for parlour girls, but at the very least go to their website and see if her name's on the list of girls so that you can then tell her that you saw her on the website.  No lying involved whatsoever.

Exactly.

There are many strategies for visiting a desired provider that do not involve mentioning a review or even a mate's say-so. First of all, you saw the ad. For a parlour, it's also simple just to say, "I've been here before and I like to meet new girls and I liked your name". Or... "Reception suggested you."

It's not that difficult. If someone is worried that a provider will ID you because of what happens in the session... surely that is only a problem if the session didn't work out. In which case, who gives a shit? You won't be going back.

If sex workers are advertising, then reviews go with the territory. If girls are working in a parlour that advertises, then again, reviews go with the territory. However, most problems arise when the first a girl knows about internet reviews is when some idiot tells them. Don't do it.

I actually said that I had read some reviews of her and I told her this. All true. In fact, she has her own webpage, which i had read and I told her this as well. So I had done my research and I had come to see her specifically, as I had booked her. But her issue was to not expect what reviewers had said about her. I can't control that. When we finished she also told me not to review her.

I once booked a girl named Tinga, going on a review at Pussy Cats. No intro! They put me in the room and I waited for her. She came in and the first thing she said was "I have never seen you before! Are you one of those men from the Internet forum?" She was attractive but her attitude really put me off. She did become more enthusiastic as we went along. There is no way I would do that again. I always have an intro and decide if they turn me on, or not. Reviews can give you a good idea on services, but not actual physical attraction.

Too true.

I never mention reviews or associated to sites to any of the ladies I have had the pleasure of visiting. Except for ladies on this forum (god bless them all). I never talk reviews just that I am a member of the same site.

I think that people mention reviews for two reasons.
1) to try and get similar services as to what has been mentioned in the reviews they have seen.
2) to make themselves look important to the WL and to try and show how "trustworthy and honest" they are. Rather than build up their own rapport with the lady.

Many members visit the same ladies and and build a rapport with them. They develop their own trust and may even have special services offered. This is special to the two of them. Some troll that tries to use these reviews to get more than what is the normal only offends the lady in question but could also open up the reviewer to a difficult situation if the lady realizes that he has written the review.

Remember men. Most of the ladies I have visited are quite smart and very savvy. One lady I had not seen for 10 months (due to work commitments) remebered my name and a lot of the things we discussed 10 months ago. A lot of WL's can put 2 and 2 together, dived it by 37 and then work out the square root.

The members that try to use the review scenario to make themselves look honest etc, are the worst. All that happens is that they are standing on the shoulders of their compatriot whilst they are drowning, the very same member, in the mire. 

A lot of members punt and report. A lot TOFTT. Unfortunately. A lot also troll the reviews and won't spend their money until several members have spent theirs and have mad them feel they are on a sure thing. Nothing is sure. Some punts can still go bad. It is up to you and how you treat your lady and how you behave yourself.

Never mention reviews or the fact you are on a review site. It leads more often to trouble. Maybe not for you.

Absolutely true Bluey. The genuine seasoned punter covers new ground... finds new experiences and conquests. Then writes a review.

Hahaha... I suppose then, the bulk of a forum is for sheep... sigh...

Hi BA,
You don't necessarily need to lie, there are heaps of other ways to overcome this situation. I usually ask the reception about a particular lady so i can safely tell to the lady that was the reception who recommended. So it's not lying.

There's nothing wrong in booking a lady sight unseen just based on the reviews. I myself have to confess have done it a couple of times, and I believe others here too. But you have to be prepared that you might get questioned by the lady. I wouldn't say it is lying, but instead not entering into too much details.

In my initial punt days I used to use "Dave" as the "punt friend" who recommended the lady (Dave is one of must common English names - classic excuse), but got myself in trouble when one WL told me "oh really? Tell ur friend his an arsehole!!" Haha, apparently fictitious Dave was her real regular!

So reception recommendation still the best approach, and is not lying cos you have to talk to reception anyway to book.

in all my punts, obviously not as many as some here, I've had one lady mention the internet to me. It was Julie at Roseville and she laughed when she asked me if I'd seen her online. Unsure if she meant on a forum or their site but I primarily see parlour workers so if one ever asks me where I heard of them I'll just tell them it was on their site.

I also know another punter who was singled out, because of his detailed reviews. Now his reviews have dropped off to virtually nothing

Although virtually retired these days I have to agree with the above.  I learned a long time ago to be very vague with regards to times of visit and anything I think may be not on the usual menu offered to everybody.  Been burned a few times with a few great finds but found a few good ones on this site so same same.

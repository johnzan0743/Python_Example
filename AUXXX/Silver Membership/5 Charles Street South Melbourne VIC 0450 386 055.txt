I came across this shop today walking between Dorcas & Coventry streets when out for a coffee with a female friend & couldn't stick my head in the door.  Does anybody have any intel of goss about this shop, I intend to TOFFT as looks promising hidden away from all in a laneway. Nothing flash too it has a red door is opposite the tuck shop couldn't find any reviews on our site but did find this add on Locanto.

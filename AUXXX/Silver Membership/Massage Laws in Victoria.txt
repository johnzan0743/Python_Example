 Massage Laws in Victoria

All I know is you don't have to be qualified to do massage. Sexual services are illegal, including hand jobs.

I'm assuming getting naked isn't sexual unless there is touching of genitals. Otherwise there wouldn't be any strip clubs in Melbourne!

If they are qualified they usually have their certificates on display. It's very easy to spot a dodgy shop. Flashing signs are a give away.





			
				Massage therapists don't have to be qualified. Umm...
Ever had a professional massage that just didn't feel right?

I've had a lady who tried to "burp" the air out of my body. Another time a man insisted on lowering the towel to places he didn't need to see.

But most recently, when I was left with more than just a headache after a visit to an inner-city Brisbane massage clinic, I couldn't shake the feeling something wasn't right.

The place was legit, well, that's what I thought, anyway. It wasn't down a dodgy dark alley in the backstreets of the burbs. It was in a well-known shopping centre.

After chatting with the so-called therapist, he informed me he found the job listed in the local paper and that he had no formal qualifications  "You just come in and they teach you".

Umm what?

The young university student embraced the "hard massage" I had asked for but his technique so close to my spine had me second guessing my request. And the next day actual concern set in as I woke with a very sore back.

I cringed at the thought this man could have done some serious damage to my spine.

A quick call to The Australian Association of Massage Therapists later and I discovered you actually don't legally require any formal qualification to practice as a massage therapist.

The industry's unregulated practice is astounding. Have you ever thought about who is massaging you? Do you know anything about their background. Or if they have a criminal history?

Most of us assume we are in the hands of reliable, qualified therapists. But the reputation of massage clinics is being jeopardised by unskilled therapists.

The AAMT has called for the introduction of a formal register to ensure the public receives legitimate, safe massages but this has fallen on deaf ears.

Surely this isn't asking too much?

Last year, the AAMT had 18 formal complaints (mostly about non-qualified individuals) across Australia.

The business I entered had enticing signage  a 40-minute back, shoulder and neck massage cost $45  and touted available health fund rebates. I had a sore neck and liked what I saw.

But the AAMT is warning us not to be fooled and recommend people see qualified therapists registered with the organisation.

CEO of AAMT Tricia Hughes says: "There are no legal requirements to have qualifications in order to practice massage, there are national qualifications and degree programs but there is no regulatory framework such as APHRA (Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency) for Allied Health."

So basically, the lack of regulations means any individual with a dodgy past could be laying their hands on our bodies.

And who's to say business owners are not abusing the system? Or exploiting individuals on work and study visas with poor employment conditions, inappropriate billing practices  particularly in high tourist areas where people are transient?

Having a massage is a very personal enterprise. There is a need and want to trust this person to be respectful and professional with our bodies. We expect them to be reliable, truthful and have ethical boundaries.

"There is an opportunity for individuals who want to prey on victims in all health practices to use treatment for inappropriate and illegal behaviour," Hughes says:

"You cannot regulate for criminal activity but you can educate the public about what is appropriate and what is inappropriate. They should always use a trained professional and request to see their membership or professional association."

People should know they have the right to refuse or stop treatment at any time and have the treatment explained to them.

So, lesson learnt. The next time I'm suffering from a tension headache or need a remedial massage, I'll be asking to see some documentation first.

Lol what a load of cogwash.
If your looking for a massage with hand relief I'm sure the lady with the certificate hanging on the wall is hardly going to give handrelief.
It depends what your looking for.
There are a lot of great massage therapists that give a fabulous massage with hand relief.
Now I'm saying that if it is highly illegal I think admin should be watching what is posted on the site as they maybe leaving these ladies open to prosecution.

Have you ever been to a RnT? Obviously not! There are no rules. Certificates on walls mean nothing, especially when all it takes is a short course, or pay for one. I'm not really sure what you want to know. There are no specific qualifications in the massage industry, or the sex industry. You don't need to do a training course to be a sex worker.

I my 25+ years of punting I can only remember one private massage lady being prosecuted for giving hand relief in Melbourne. That was a Chinese lady doctor providing RNT for her clients from her surgery with the guys claiming it on Medicare.

The only prosecutions are Massage Parlours, usually in a shopping centre or a shopping strip etc, and only when they receive a complaint.
The police dont have the manpower, time and resources to put in to the real crimes they have, let alone investigating private massage ladies giving handjobs.

nextlife, if it's the one I'm thinking of, the Herald-Sun had the superb headline of "Medibonk".

There was more than just HJs going on there though; I visited several times and got FS on one occasion.

Why ask then? I'm guessing you're worried about the legalities for Chloe. Basically if you're offering sexual services in Victoria you need a SWA. You can apply for a brothel exempt license for 2 girls. Once you go through all the hoops you're set! Good luck.

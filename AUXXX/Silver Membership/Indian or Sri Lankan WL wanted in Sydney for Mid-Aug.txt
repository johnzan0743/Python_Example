 Indian or Sri Lankan WL wanted in Sydney for Mid-Aug
				
Post Content: 
I'm looking for a young Indian or Sri Lankan WL for mid-August (12th - 15th) in Sydney area or slightly south.
Any SILVER or GOLD member recommendations will be appreciated.
It doesn't have to be a recommendation even. I'll TOFTT if your many eyes can help me scan the paper & online menus

Hey, maugoat... I just did a backpage search for "indian" under Sydney Escorts. There's quite a list HERE

I can confirm that this advertiser is using fake pictures - Indian Babe With Big Boobs and Pretty Face 200 p/h ? - Sydney escorts - backpage.com

A few other punters and myself have reviewed her on here - https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f100/...indian+locanto

Thanks Hard!
I'll do a search like you did as I get closer to game day!
BTW, there seems to be a few dodgy ads there from the Parramatta area.
Buyer beware. If it seems to god to be true it normally is.

Hmmm! New unchartered territory for this little goat! I rang & was told the manager is the person I need to speak with tomorrow. 
Spank you Wotan, spank you very much!

Cheers mate! Yes always caveat emptor... but while you have to exercise discretion in sifting the junk, backpage/cracker is a pretty good source for a variety of activity.

Indians can be a bit hard to source... good ones anyway. Good luck!

If you don't want to waste your time go and see Sonya at Liaisons.

If you want to live in hope then search through cracker, backpage etc and most likely you will go home disappointed.

I'm about to see what the new Indian jasmine at 142 is like. Ill report back if successful. Sounds like she's a bit unreliable in terms of attendance.

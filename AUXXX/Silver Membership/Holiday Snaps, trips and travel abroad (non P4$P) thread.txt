Granox,

I have moved your thread to Silver now as these type of pictures do not conform with the bronze area of posting..

I have created a new thread for those who wish to post pictures, snaps of travel and adventure abroad..

[COLOR="#FF0000"]We like to add that all pictures shown and posted have the "consent" of the said person to be posted.. this is just common curtesy and hopefully release photographic waiver..  [/COLOR]

Any further questions can be addressed accordingly..

Met her on Filipino Cupid and corresponded to her for about 5 months and decided to go and see her.  Unfortunately the resort we had booked was closed because of a typhoon.  So we headed into the mountains to Batangas to a nice little resort there.  
She dosen't mind me posting the photos as long as she sees them first.  The cost was treating her for the week and a little shopping and everything was on the table except anal.
I will be saving up and go back to see her again.

You can "review" whatever you like within the rules of he forum code of conduct.. 

If there is a demand for it I can start a thread for it and you may post away?.. If not we may edit this thread to reflect it.. 

It maybe a seperate dating "success" stories thread different from the other thread on Ashley Madison etc

Just let me know..

Perhaps I'm allowing my conscience to intrude too far in what is already murky territory, but I'm grappling with the ethical dilemma of members posting 'reviews' of women they meet via dating sites on a forum designed for reviewing sex workers who offer their services in exchange for cash.  Granted, in Granox's case there was a financial consideration of sorts for his extended GFE, but I'm just thinking about those women whom members might meet via dating sites without any direct exchange of money/goods for services rendered (I'm not counting buying them dinner or footing the bill for a dirty weekend).  It sounds like pushing the envelope a bit, particularly if it's without their consent, because they may not wish to hook up with just any guy who propositions them.  

The exceptions could be semi-pros who are openly looking for blokes to pay them or buy them stuff in exchange for sex (without being full-time WLs), or those floozies who are quite happy to let their promiscuity be broadcast in the hope of snaring new partners, but that would be after asking their permission (like Granox says he did before posting his lbfm's pics).  Or the 'reviews' could be anonymous so that the subject cannot be identified, even by people who know them.

Apologies if I'm over-complicating things (and betraying the Dark Side!) but just my initial reaction to this idea.  Maybe I should have chosen Look Skywanker as my handle.

I think the key is consent. I would also think that few amateurs would give such consent. But if it's P4P and a girl is happy for the "publicity" then I see no issue.

If identifying images are posted without permission on an essentially public forum, then IMO, it's out of line. The key in that second viewpoint is "identifying".... which can be features other than just face.

Seems the girl in the OP was happy... just wish I'd taken the snaps!!! I do like Granox's persistence in setting up the holiday

Post Content: 
It is correct that what LV has noted..  we are P4P review website.. But in saying that.. The "cost" associated with any of the dating sites is correlated?.. Still have to pay for access?.. Then the added costs of wine and dine etc?.. So it is still in "theory" P4P?.. If you like look at it that way askewed?.. 

So I guess it boils down to your own personal ethics and values?.. 

There are a few other forums which have his very same "scenario" and seperate areas were created for it.. 

As such like sugar babes, milf sugarbabes etc.. 

Those considers to be "part time" and not "associated" with the stigma attached of being a "professional" worker if you like put it!.. 

Casual hookups and booty calls.. 

Where payment is still expected in the forum of split hotel room costs etc.. 

So in saying that.. 

You can decide what you would like to do?.. 

And we can go from there?.. 

It is "your" forum and if the demand is great enough then it will have the attention of the forum membership to contribute..

Well as far as I'm concerned AB i like it just the way it is. I think unlike a ML review where it is a similar scenario each time the scenario's here may be so varied they don't fit into one style of review format.  Maybe rather than a review format a set of general guidelines would be more appropriate stating please include....where this was....how contact was first established and for how long....cost of the rendezvous ....direct cost to the lady ...associated costs..... just as an example

Good thoughts Granox... we would all be interested e.g. in how you persist with all the logistics of establishing the long term 'geographically impossible' contact and eventually pulling it all off... very impressive!

ok
Well saw her profile on Filipino Cupid and tried to talk to her she would generally say hi but not much else.  She wasn't really interested in me.  See she's 29 and I'm 57 but i just persisted saying good morning every day and good night and told her she was stunning.  Like they say piss and perseverance will wash away mountains.  Eventually we spoke more and more and our talk started to get raunchy.  Finally I agreed to come over and spend some time together so I made all the bookings from here and the rest is history.  I spent a very nice week with her all to myself and considering I look like Smeagle I was in heaven.  I think if you are complementary, not too pushy, and patient the world is yours.   Oh and yes yahoo messenger is your friend in this scenario oh and one more thing...I would advise to be funny.

As for you Goldies - I don't know how you select entrants into your holey order but in my day job a very high performance rating can only be achieved when the candidate manufactors a "how the fuck did he do that" moment.

There are four types of sex in a marriage:

Kitchen Sex:
  This is at the beginning of the marriage; you'll have sex 
anywhere, anytime, any room.  Hence, in the kitchen.

Bedroom Sex:
  You've calmed down a bit, perhaps have kids, so you must 
only do it in the bedroom.

Hallway Sex:
  This is where you pass each other in the hallway and say 
"Fuck you."

Courtroom Sex:
  This is when you get divorced and your spouse fucks you 
in front of everyone in court.

A nice thought Hard - but I don't really have the opportunities to (schedule wise) do enough punting to qualify I would think. An even bigger impediment is that I tend to settle in to a routine with a couple of ladies and stay with that for months at a time. A combination of lazy, chicken hearted and unimaginative I guess!

For instance I would love to dive in to one of those EMP/Jenna inspired orgies but even if I lived in Sydney I don't think I'd have the bottle.

It's nice to dream though!

It is reminded that the pictures contained which has been provided as gratuity by Granox have been in the spirit of the thread and discussion.. 

Granox sought the Admin permission before posting.. 

Which was granted upon the grounds of the spirit of the thread.. 

By no means is it gospel and that although R18+.. We are still bound by the oz classification code and we cannot be seen as promoting "pornographic" material even though the content and nature of the forum and site says and demonstrates otherwise.. 

As we are a punting and review site.. Not a "sex" site.. With XXX rated images, video and material.. 

So in saying that the rules and code of conduct still applies in his area and throughout.. Pictures are to be of a softer nature and others of more graphic nature be placed in GOLD if you are of that level..

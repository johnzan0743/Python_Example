 Rimming in/around strathfield
				
Post Content: 
Hi guys,

I live in homebush and find all the best shops for rimming are quite far away, I know there's Melissa in strathfield from searays recent post and have left her a message for a booking.

Was wondering if anyone else knew if there were any shops or pwl/pml with rimming and bbbj as a service?

Thanks guys, just sucks sometimes I don't have the time to go Hornsby/533 as its a bit of a drive when having limited punting time.

Cheers!
SS

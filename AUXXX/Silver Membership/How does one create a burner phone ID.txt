This has been my experience every time including recently. How do you do this without ID for an Australian SIM card

It’s easy you do it online. You make up a name and use an address ( real one) and  then you look at your drivers license. You take the card number from that and use that as your ID for your new alias. The system has no way of checking the veracity of the details you supply them. As long as the DL card number on the card is the correct number of digits long it will be accepted You need an email address and a second address to backup and recover in case you have issues with lost sim phone or a reset of your PUK codes. 
You will need to create an entity that has all the usual details of a living entity such as an address ( best be able to access this in case of correspondence) a full name two given one surname a date of birth and any other details normally used by a real entity.

This is in Silver as it is suggesting something that is a. Guide only not a set of instructions to enable something that might be against the Australian Telecommunications Act.
Disclaimer. Ensure you use this on a pre paid mobile phone number and turn off GPS enabled devices when using creative ID’s. Nothing in the above statement or instructions suggests in any way that you are being encouraged to break the law.

By the way it is extremely important that you do not use your drivers license number for the ID number but rather utilise the card number which can be found and is used for verification by the database to ensure the validity of your actual drivers license. It cannot be backward engineered to obtain your ID.

The above question was asked by a bronze member in General Discussion But is being posted in Silver as there likely are way too many dickheads who have access to bronze who simply put cannot be trusted...

Hopefully. Those on here who have access can be more sensible with this discussion.

Thanks for reading.

Which app gives you a AU number? They're all US as far as I saw when I looked. No use!

For those who don't know and might be too embarrassed to ask a 'burner' phone is an unregistered sim that is required to log onto a mobile phone network. The SIM card is the chip with an IC that is supposed to be registered for the purpose of being able to track it down and assign it to an individual who basically is to be held responsible for its use.

Well that is the general idea. Not foolproof only because fools are so ingenious..

Wikipedia describes a burner phone as such...

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn...e_application)


Effectively having a mobile with a sim card that is logged into the phones ID numbers requires taking a few steps to avoid pinpointing the individual who owns or operates the phone and therefore can be placed in possession of the phone.
There are many programmes that assist in preventing the detection of the source of the phone. This is done by triangulation of the signal.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobi...ication_number

Every mob phone has a unique identifier number assigned to it. If you have a burner SIM best use it in different devices if you wish to avoid detection. Be aware that if you want to remain anonymous then you remove both the SIM card and the Mobile phone's battery. Best do this before you travel home if you don't wish to be traced. 

Now this is extreme paranoia however it remains prudent to practice if you have another significant individual that you wish to keep in the dark ...
It never hurts to have your burner prepaid switched off save for when you need it.

A lot of these service providers think nothing of sending you broadcast messages announcing their latest offers..... that is both the adult services and the mobile phone services provider...

Now this is a topic that is meant to provide information not direction. It is up to the individual member to elect to use this thread for Educational purposes to effectively disguise any trail left that is their decision to elect to remove.

It in no way is meant to provide readers with an opportunity to evade or break the law.

The idea is if you have a wish not to be tracked then the best way of doing this is simply to leave your mob phone at home or at work. After all 30 years ago that likely would not be the option cause mostly no one had a brick....to leave or take anywhere.

You can get an AU number with the Hushed app although you still have to go through standard ID checks.  Better to get a US number with a 30 day worldwide plan.

Backpackers returning overseas are also a good source of already-registered pre-paid SIM cards. Give them $50 for the card and login details to top up. 

The problem then is topping up. You can use paypal with Optus, and setting up a fake paypal is easy. But at the end of the day getting money into the account without using a CC or Debit is a pain. So it's not entirely untraceable.

1. Buy a prepaid SIM from a backpacker
2. Buy top ups in cash from Coles/Woolies etc.
3. You're welcome

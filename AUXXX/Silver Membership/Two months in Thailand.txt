 Two months in Thailand
				
Post Content: 
G'day guys, just shooting the breeze here.........no reviews or anything. I've just returned from another 2 month trip to the Land of Smiles, in particular, Phuket this time. I'm posting here because I have an issue with someone who is able to see posts in the Bronze area and after reading this, it would "blow my cover". I don't want any of my info being passed on to others if you know what i mean ;-) Admin, if you feel the need to move it to another area, open to others, let me know and I'll delete the thread. Anyway, heres a few of my observations from the time away. 

1.....The first thing i noticed.....the crappy exchange rate and the fact our dollar doesn't buy as much as it has in the past. Most massages have the standard 300/350tbht ($15) starting price, but if you're after a "hamburger with the lot", you can expect to pay around 1500tbht (Aus$58-$60). Not really as cheap as it was in the past, with the current exchange rate. Of course, thats always negotiable, the girls usually start a lot higher, but that seemed to be the average. One lovely lass &nbsp;accepted somewhat less, but it was late in the evening and I suspect she hadn't had a busy day. I only use the services of massage ladies and don't frequent the bar scene or the Go Go girls, so I can't comment on the pricing structure there. I have heard prices in the 2000-3000tbht (Aus$115) for a bar lady and even more for a Go Go dancer, who is another rung up the ladder in terms of looks. Then theres usually a bar fine imposed on top of that as well. So really, its not that cheap any more. In fact, none of the prices have really changed that much over the years, it's just the shitty exchange rate thats killing us at the moment. 

2....The resort where we stayed was full of Chinese tourists. I'd say it was 80% Chinese. They are mostly youngish couples, some families and some travelling with their mums n dads, who seemed to looking after their one grand kid. The Chinese, at least the ones where we stayed on the whole were dirty bastards. I had an issue with one guy, swimming in the resort pool and blowing his nose into the pool. He had no English language skills, but he had no trouble understanding the tirade i fired off at him when I saw him coughing and then hocking loogies into the pool. It was disgusting. He wasn't the only one doing it either. They are also loud and have no respect for others, by swimming in the resort pool late into the night as they have been out on tour during the day. So when they return to the resort, they all head to the pools, which are supposed to be closed at night. They all got together around midnight and yell and scream, kids included at the top of their voice, acting like it's midday. I really started to dislike the cnuts. Having said that, there were a couple of pretty impressive young lasses, travelling together, who were a cut above the others. Had a pretty nice morning with them as one of them was taking model pics of the other, in various positions around the pool and surrounding gardens. My mate and I palled up with them for a while, but I ended up walking. They couldn't speak a word of English, and the "model" was so far up herself, I was getting the feeling we were wasting our time, I believed they were lesbians. They both had the most amazing Mons both protruded incredibly, especially once their bikini bottoms were wet. Beautiful stuff. The photographer also had the biggest natural titties for an Asian. Would've love to have seen them naked, but it never happened.

3...Still quite a number of Russians as well, but didn't seem to be there in the numbers Ive seen in the past. Once again, they are an arrogant race and treat the local Thais like shit. Never tipping for anything and just plain rude/arrogant to most other people, especially the Thais. The one thing I did like, is that a lot of the Russian women seem to think nothing of prancing around, either in their bikini's or tight shorts......and displaying the best fucking Cameltoes. It must be a national identity thing, like something they are taught at school, that and the straight cut fringe, but some of the cutest young women think nothing of "flashing the toe" as they walk down the street. And I mean massive toes, the ones you can see coming&nbsp;from twenty metres, walking towards you. I loved that aspect, but thats about all. There was young (20ish) lass, staying at our resort who was travelling with her Mum. Every day, she would do exercises around the pool, in her bikini, the sort a gymnast would do to limber up. It was amazing stuff. I watched her a few mornings as she bent into all sorts of shapes, legs wide open at times, standing on her head etc. It was a beautiful thing to watch. But once again, they were arrogant and had nothing to do with anyone else at the resort. Wouldn't even acknowledge a "g'day" at breaky etc.

4....As I said, I don't frequent the bars etc, but met some friends from home one night and they wanted a "tour" of the Patong nightclubs etc. So we ended up in one bar/disco that also had a live band. I was embarrassed by a group of Aussie bogans who came in and took over the dance floor, shouting the usual Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, Oi Oi Oi shit. Its so embarrassing and makes me cringe to watch and listen to them. All the guys had fresh tattoos, covered in glad wrap. Ive mentioned in other posts in the past, how I dislike the Aussie tourist. These people didn't let me down.

So, apart from the above observations, we had a great trip. Just three mates who have been travelling there for a number of years, sometimes three times a year. Next trip is planned for October/November, all being well.

Ciao.

Thanks, appreciate your Thailand posts Lofty  Also had a recent trip...but to Bangkok. 

I found the beach lifestyle in Phuket a lot more preferable than the fast craziness and sprawl of Bangkok. Punting and getting women is also logistically much easier in Phuket.

Would be interested to hear about Koh Samui or even Pattaya (apparently the sex capital of the world) from punters perspective..love the land of smiles and always keen on going back!

Oh mate, this is vintage!  On vacation in Norway, the Chinese there were scum too, shouting over the top of all train announcements not in Chinese, smoking when smoking is banned. Before the train stopped they'd rush the doors trying to rip them open, shouting, shoving other tourists out the way ...and that's just the women! I had no guilt in shoving the bitches back and holding them all back until the other tourists exited. Pure filth!"

"Still quite a number of Russians as well, ...Once again, they are an arrogant race and treat the local Thais like shit. Never tipping for anything and just plain rude/arrogant to most other people, especially the Thais."
I had the misfortune of being married to a Russian for a while. Most Russians have had politeness-ectomys, replaced with arrogance organs. The fact that a big majority vote in a cheap thug like Putin says it all. Best day of the marriage was the day she left. They stink. 

"...Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, Oi Oi Oi shit. Its so embarrassing and makes me cringe to watch and listen to them."
Unfortunately the cheaper SE Asian destinations are all that the bogans can afford, so they embarrass us all there.

I've posted previously about punting in Thailand, but I'm off to Thailand tomorrow and will try to make time to post an update of what the scene is like over there at the moment.

I've (unfortunately) got 2 nights in Bangkok for work, but then heading to Pattaya for a week. 

I say "unfortunately" because even though I love Bangkok and feel a great affinity for the place, (mostly after living there previously for 7 years), the cost of drinking/punting in Bangkok is getting ridiculous and more-often-than-not more than punting here in Oz. 
Pattaya is MUCH better for punting in my opinion and more relaxed.

No offence to the OP, but I'm happy never to set foot in Phuket again. If I want a beach holiday in Thailand there are far nicer options - Krabi, Ko Lanta, Khao Lak etc. Each to their own of course. 

Will try to post while I'm away and some pics as well if possible.

Good read lofty and pretty much the same last time I was there.
Hated the arrogant ruskys, didn't have much of the Asian experience from China but definitely the cringe worthy Aussie bogan.
I stayed at Karon beach about 10 minutes south of pat-tong  and loved it.
Found an awesome bar with live music and accidentally fell into bar girls pussies.
Rates were pretty good. Rooms were $10 if you didn't want to go back to your apartment . 
I would love to get back there soon, am definitely interested in pattaya and other places, wahin ? Krabi if anyone has any info would be good to hear .

Aussieco, we prefer to stay away from Pootong as well and always head to a favourite place at Kata Beach. Twenty minutes south of the rat race of Pootong and a lot quieter for us old guys ;-). Still heaps of pussy around if you haven't got your own favourite to take care of you as well.

Just a comment on the exchange rate issue. Currently at 26 Baht for an Aussie buck, this hasn't changed much in the 35 years since I first went to the LOS. It's our AU > US$ rate that fucks it.

So, buy your Baht direct from AU$ either here or there and bypass two forex transactions. Of course we all know that we always lose and the banks always win in any forex deals. But it is possible to minimise losses with some careful finance pre-planning. Shop for a good travel-cash card and do your xchges when the rate is up. Some cards now pre-load with Baht.

Thanks for the appraisal Lofty... a useful recap. Thailand isn't what it once was but away from the busiest tourist hangouts, there's still great fun to be had. On Phuket, old Phuket Town is a much gentler experience than the beaches it seems. Last time there (gestapo accompanied  ) there was plenty of possibility without the brash tourist attitudes.

Hard, thanks for the advice on the exchange rates and use of travel cards. I already use a local travel card that I pre load before the trips, but I'm just finding we aren't getting the same value for money. I thought we used to get around 30 baht a few years ago, now its like you say around 26 baht. I was actually getting 25. something most times I withdrew from an ATM. Funny you mention old Phuket town as a destination. I'm currently looking for somewhere to stay on the next visit and have been searching the hotels around the old town as an alternative to Kata/Karon Beach, where we normally stay. I've also been given a pretty good heads up on an establishment in old Phuket Town, where my local mate who drives a taxi wants to take us. He was telling us about it on the trip to the airport last visit. Apparently there are lots of local Thai lasses who work there when they need to top up their cash flow. The place is frequented by local Thai's and not many faring know about it.  He promised to take us there next visit. So I'm gonna take him up on it. I'll obviously report the findings here for others.

Had a holiday in Phuket a few months ago and went to a local bar in Karon. Ended up having a chat to one of the local bar girls for a bit down near the Centara hotel. It was a hoot of a night and I ended up shit faced....the girls sure can drink. I asked how much it would cost for FS...300 for the bar, 500 for the room and 1000 for the girl which equates to about $70 aud...she knew nothing was going to happen as I had told her from the start and that if another lad rocked up to walk away and do what you have to do....as she has to make a living...

I must admit that it is a strange old world over there....seeing 20 something yr old western guys having toungies with ladyboys to an old western granny going nuts with a young thai boy on the dance floor and the antics of the local girls. Both myself and the thai woman I was chatting to were killing ourselves laughing...but the show stopper for me was seeing the girl I was with sneer at a western guy about 60 yrs old as he came past only upon my enquiries as to why to hear her reply that he was a cheap bastard....guess you can get a cheaper rate but I was there to drink and have fun and not to roger some thai chick senseless.

Gotta admit to falling in love with the thai people, they are just a nice bunch of people but could see myself having a world of fun given half the chance.

Low season at the moment (September), Lofty's post is spot on regarding the Chinese tourists... there are literally swarms of them in massive tour groups (seems like a horde  of 70-80 people especially James Bond Island). Literally herded like cattle in a boat, taken to tourist spot...take a photo for 5-10 mins then herded off to the next destination. 

Best to avoid the cheaper tour groups and avoid the crowds.....just hire a motorbike and cruise the island...its the best!

I'm kinda over Patong to be honest, Kata and surrounds is probably the most appealing on the island. Haven't really seen many Russians at all either .. just small pockets of tourists from all over the world which is perfect (apart from the Chinese) 

Will do a punt report if it happens (its unlikely though)

Cheers, 
HB

Person's Name : Noky

Establishment : Massage place at Patong (....she was at AOM massage but moved last week)

Date of Visit : Sep 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : n/a

Hours of Business : AOM massage is 24/7 

Rates : Gave her 2500 baht (approx. $100)

Age : 20 or less

Size/shape : Slim petite, curvier meatier but now (she's been working out apparently )

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : FS

Value for money/recommend? : Yes and yes.. she's one amongst thousands of massage ladies in Phuket though. 

My experience/comments :

Ok this may not really qualify for a 'proper review' since I already know and have seen this chick about a year and a half earlier. (https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f167/...nd-noki-27235/). The majority of the reports I do are mainly for myself as a keen punter to keep a record... so this one is mainly an online journal entry. 

I actually couldn't believe and wasn't expecting to see her again after the first time (it is Thailand after all) and didn't intend to punt in Thailand for this trip at all...Thought I might give it a shot though since this chick was one of the best looking Thai girls I met on my last trip. 

Went to AOM massage place again and chatted to one of the ladies I talked to before and met previously... luckily enough she knew Noky and had her number. Thank you the punting gods  A phone call or two later she arrived soon enough in her little scooter. Wow same old (young) Noky.. cheeky schoolgirl with her braces and funky stylish clothes. I couldn't believe it, soon she was following me to the hotel for some relax time and massage  Arrived at the hotel and relaxed with a back massage (she is really good at it) then before I knew it I was on top of her slowly taking off her little denim shorts, tight top, bra, then sliding off her panties. 

The sex part: 
Her pussy is big and meaty for such a petite girl.. also impressive she put on a tiny bit of weight with her tits and arse meatier than last time, more of a small hourglass shape now. She is still the same cheeky girl. Good cock on pussy rub, then fucking in many positions with the condom on (I did get tested previously and was all clear). Her skin, softness and curves were amazing, super flexible too and responsive to the best angles of penetration and rhythm. She is light, flexible and easy to manage so little subtleties of position really impressed and had me thinking....holy shit, now this shit is the best thing in the world!. I mainly prefer my girls on the thin/lighter end of the scale, (meaty/heavier girls have their merits too but it is just v e r y different fucking them.. heavier or meaty girls are more for pounding than a 'kama sutra' type of style).

We took our time with the sex and really moved slowly changing positions and speed of the pleasure. Cowgirl variations (squeezing dat arse and really working her pussy on my cock... What really impressed was a very passionate rear doggy but bouncy from behind kneeling style, appreciating her hourglass figure, massaging and squeezing her tits from behind as I worked up and under her arse for a nice deep access. Spreading her legs and just taking in the moment, again from slow to fast... Ok no more play by play but action since the session went for over two hours but we weren't really counting as it was a private arrangement. 

Eventually came in missionary for a prolonged spasm. She cheekily acknowledged my flexing/spasming cock inside her with a priceless smile. Damn what a funny girl. Showered, relaxed, massaged again, massaged her got behind and fucked her again, spread those arse cheeks while masturbating over her bald peachy pussy lips from behind and spreading and grabbing her arse harder and harder. Came again all over her butt, cum flew to the floor and on her hair and also on the ground... Holy shit, it cracked her up again with some giggles... Showered got dressed, exchanged numbers and walked her out to her scooter. Might be round three or four in the coming days who knows... This night already exceeded every expectation and just glad about everything. 

End.

Theres just an abundance of massage shops in Kata/Karon. Personally, I'm more a fan of the Kata area and don't head to Karon that much. Theres a couple of soi's in Kata that have massage shops that will see you straight. ;-) Not sure of the name of each soi, but they are perpendicular to the road that runs along the boundary of the Club Med site (not the beach side obviously). Personally, I had great luck in all but a few. You will even get a lady to spend time with you on your holiday if thats your want. Most of them will offer what you want.........the Baht rules supreme my friend.....

Try Titephon massage in Karon near the roundabout north end, the girls usually sit under an umbrella that leads up a set of stairs....U can get everything U want and the girls are good fun 1000 thb for massage + bj + about another 500 if u want the lot. I saw a girl there called Emma, about 40yrs old with a stunning body and cool personality too...If going there soon, there is another girl who has braces on her teeth and about 30yrs old...U wont be disappointed, reckons she wont be there too much longer...

On the corner of the roundabout is another shop where the girls wear pink t shirts...no complaints from me...

Apple or Mango massage on a side street near Centara Karon will give good massages too...

Hope this helps...

Lofty14u spent 2 months in Thailand and I just clocked about 30 months in Thailand.

Contrary to media life has not change much for the normal people since the coup.
The Shinawatra influence is too strong and they would win any election because the normal people supports and love them.
Taksin was corrupt and looked after his mates but every Thai government before him was no different.
The current junta is bogged in corruption and scandals too.
It helps when you control the army so they just suppress everything and throw you in jail or "attitude adjustment" camp.

Sex in the land of smiles also unchanged.
Pattaya is still the sex capital of Asia. 
You don't need a guide to find pussy there.
Even the ugliest guy can get laid if he has the money.

Admittedly Pattaya is almost a Russian satellite town.
They just love the beaches and sun especially coming from such a cold country.
You can see all the streets signs in Pattaya are also in Russian (and now Chinese).
They got Russian bars with Russian, Euro girls working in them.
Past year Russian tourists have reduced greatly to Thailand because of the crash of their currency.

Fortunately for Thailand, Chinese tourists have overtaken the Russians.
Thai government also increasing ties with Chinese and gave them visa free access to Thailand.
The gates have opened and the Chinese have flooded every tourist city in Thailand and even the high class brothels.
Most of the Chinese tourist are bad manners and really low class but I see many Aussies behaving worst.

All you guys who want to live in Pattaya, Phuket, Bangkok, and resort Islands you paying more for everything than in the north (Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Udon Thani).
Petty crime also higher in the southern places too.

Most of the WL end up in those places in the south because the big demand for them are there.
That is why Udon Thani has the record of the most Thai girls married to foreigners.
Isan girls flock south to make a living selling their bodies.
Hunters stalking WL get trapped by the prey they hunting.

Finding pussy in Bangkok is too easy.
I always get a taxi or tuktuk driver if I looking for anything "special".
Who else would know where all the places are?

If they make something on the side I am happy for them since I get paid in AUD and the only earn a pittance compared to me.
Just be careful of some scams where establishments over charge for entry or drinks but you have to make sure at the beginning before you enter.

If you are a FARANG (foreigner) then you can pay more so expect to be given a higher price.
It is always good to have someone local with you to make sure the prices are not too inflated.

Bars and nightclubs frequented by foreigners already have fixed prices.
If you get too pissed and drunk, you deserved to be ripped off.

If you go to Bangkok, you must try one of the high class brothels.
You pay B3,500-B6,000 ($120 -$250) for the most beautiful girls to give you a 90 minute wash, massage and sex.
Price depends on how pretty and "fresh" the girl is.
That is CHEAP when you look at what the high end escorts charge in Sydney.

If you going to marry a hooker then marry one of these WLs.
Most of them are not dark skinned Isan girls but the fair skin girls from Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai.

(Personally I love the black ones).

Any of you guys ever check out www.streetmeatasia.com?

Great porn site of the old British guy fucking all these young Thai WLs.
He had a heart bypass about 2 years ago and now got an American guy doing all the fucking for him for his website.

You can do what you see every day for $100 in Thailand.

Some of those girls really really look young and borderline 18s.

That is so real and true what happens.

Too easy it is to fall for one of them.

If you see Thai girls plastered with tattoos then you can be 90% sure you can make an offer for sex and they will accept.

Not if you plan it right my friend. The three of us who travel regularly (for a few months at a time on some trips) are very much all in that same boat!

Mate, tattoos are quite popular with Thais across all demographics and unless they happen to be hanging out in a readily identifiable bar area for foreigners propositioning a TG based on this criteria alone could catch you a beating. I don't want to sound like a prude but have spent a lot a time in LOS, learned some of the language and have a great deal of respect for Thais but you are not doing foreigners any favours in the eyes of Thais.

You will rarely find respectable Thai women with the tattoos which you see plastered on Thai WLs.


Tattoos are common and acceptable with MEN.

There are no perfect identifiers for a Thai WLs but if there ever was one it would be the tattoos.

Traditional Thai people look badly on women with tattoos. I wonder why?

I have a couple of female thai friends who have extensive tattoos but are not hookers however I have recently had three Thai chicks in the MP's at Suk Soi 24 who had no tattoos whatsoever.

What does this indicate to you?

I don't think your criteria is one that should be acted upon if a punter spotted a tattooed girl working in a 7/11.

A perfect indicator for a thai prostitute would be if she was working in an area clearly associated with prostitution as a prostitute. Logically this would not normally include a 7/11.

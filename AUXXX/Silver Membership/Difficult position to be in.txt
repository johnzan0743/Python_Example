 Difficult position to be in
				
Post Content: 
I had been going to a different brothel to try out a young cauc girl. One of the girls in the line up is the daughter of a good mate of mine. She turned 18 last October, I went to her party, she is stunningly hot. Needless to say I picked her out of the line up and she agreed to the session too. 
The session was a 12/10. Simply amazing in every way. This girl is a total fuck fest horn bag. Don't ask for a review or even the shop because I won't say. 
I've seen her 3 times now and it keeps getting better.
She approached me with an arrangement to see her privately at my house. She is a lovely young girl, fantastic upbringing, motivated, her parents are on the conservative side. If they found out she was a SW, there would be some serious issues. She obviously loves sex. I have to admit these sessions are fantastic. 
But I think seeing her privately might be going too far? I know she is an adult but I also think things could get messy. 
So some advice from the floor if you will. Thoughts on the matter?

Sorry Sunny i like the initial part that was just amazing, sorry to see you are now having worries now it seems to have gone too far. I hope it does not get messy in that she may blackmail u in the future with a " i will tell my parents".

I very seriously doubt she will try to blackmail anyone. I have known her most of her life. She is a fine young lady and if anything got out it would affect her far more than it would me so I know that is not going to happen.

The situation you describe is very dangerous, particularly if you had any social contact with this young lady before she turned 18.  Eventually things will go wrong, ie when she wants you to make a commitment to her and you decline, and then she may very well accuse you of having groomed her, even of having had sexual contact with her before she turned 18.  If she does do that, how will you be able to disprove her allegations? She will be able to describe sexual sessions with you very convincingly to the jury.

You say you have known her most of her life.  Did you at any time before she turned 18 compliment her on her looks?  If you did, the Prosecution will allege that you were grooming her.

Daughter of a mate ?
Somewhat of a red flag !
How do you look him in the eye again ?
Personally I would make any excuse to bail out, and hope like hell that there are no repercussions down the track.

My biggest concern is if things get messy if, when, I end the private arrangement. At least at the parlour is neutral ground without any ongoing commitment.

I certainly understand what you are saying but in the heat of the moment it's easy to let the little head to the thinking for you.

It sounds like a dirty old man's wet dream cum true finely balanced on that line between ecstasy and tragedy. 

So many variables to consider:
- just how good a mate is her dad?
- how often do you see him and her at the same time?
- if you're married/attached, how cluey is your gestapo?
- are you loaded and does she know this?
- do you have kids and if so is she tight with them?
- is she besotted with you or just in it for the (paid) sex?
- what's your risk appetite in general?
- if everything turns to custard, will the great sex have been worth it??
- which shop and what's her name? (Just thought I'd slip that one in )
etc. etc.

If you continue seeing her, at the very least it would be prudent to set mutually agreed boundaries, protocols and exit point for the arrangement if it continues in whatever form, whether at the shop or privately. I think you already know you're playing with fire but you're best-placed to know if it's worth the risk or if it can be managed and the 'affair' concluded amicably. Good luck!

3. No attachments
4. Not loaded 
5. No kids
6. Just paid sex which is mutually beneficial
7. For this? Very high
8. Probably not but that thrill while it is going is great

Thanks for the replies men
 I know what I was going to do, I just had to put it out there. Seeing her privately is a no go for me. Even seeing her at the parlour isn't going to happen any more. Best to start thinking with the big head instead of the little head.

Thanks for putting it out there and thanks for trusting the wisdom of the forum members mostly wise all of us wiseguys.

The decision you have made should sit well with you. The bonus is you will have both funds and time to punt and enjoy elsewhere. 
It is a precarious situation that many encounter in life. I trust you can explain to her that it is best left this way and if she needs to chat you will be there on the end of a phone if she has difficulty dealing with anything.
Life is full of choices. Indeed you have made the right one. 
At least you don't have to wonder. 
Take care.

SR.

Great decision shows you can see the big picture. 

Now can you tell us where she works? 

Cheers, wanderlust.

Sorry to say but for me personally and my opinion only, that was a no go zone, specially cause it's your best mates daughter, and how could you sit there in front of your computer and say he is a good mate of yours?
I don't think good mates do this, but to me your not a good mate at all, what if you had a daughter and she decided to do this and your mate or mates was banging her? See where I'm getting at? Of course you don't feel anything because you don't have kids of your own, only a parent would know, specially if you have a daughter.
If I was in your shoes I would have handled it very differently, I would have not chosen her and when you did meet up with her again, pull her aside and have a chat to her and ask questions about her new found career, be like a father figure and have a chat. No one wants their daughter in this industry where there is dirty men like us around. Yeah we all like a good bang, but there will come a time where there is a fine line we don't cross, and you sir just crossed that fine line.

I wish you all the best of luck in this situation that you got yourself into, from this point, it can go either way.

Some comments are best left unsaid or unstated.

This was such an occasion. 

Best keep your opinion to self rather than expose the hypocrisy in one's soul.

You are completely right. The more I think about this the more I am dissatisfied with my behaviour. I do consider myself to be a good person however I know I have overstepped the line here. I should never have chosen her. It's not what mates do.  Amazing how time away and a bit of discussion clears your head to make you think straight.

I have refrained from making comment on this but you seem to have come to a good decision. I hope you can extract yourself from this situation with as little damage as possible to both of you.

Sunnyboy don't beat yourself up over this.

Mistake it may have been but plenty of us have clouded judgements and live to reflect or regret.

Life throws opportunities our way often. Some we just grab hold of and ride like there is no tomorrow.

You did probably what many would have and reflected regretting that decision and direction.

The thing here and now is you have exposed yourself to the forum and for that you should be respected.

Each one of us has different morals. Some of us nod in agreement yet others condemn what they have yet to experience.
None of us really know what we would do until the situation confronts us or the opportunity arrives.
Hats off to you for being open and eventually seeing the path you took was the wrong one for you.

That being said it probably is best to not pontificate over this path for longer than you have.
Get on with the future and learn from the past.

Thanks for sharing and also for listening to the conscience inside of you.

Thing to do next...Punt Punt and then Punt.

Probably not an appropriate comment to make light of this situation. I assume you have little insight by that comment.

Yeah nah don't do that to your mate. For me it's morally wrong.

In saying that though, I would say if her parents are conservative, as long as you're only meeting at the brothel, her telling them that you're screwing her damages her position too.

So I wouldn't get her over to your place under any circumstances.

Probably best this thread gets the bow tie treatment. It has been canvassed and probably needs little else or another opine.

So this thread whilst interesting is possibly a touchy subject ( no pun intended but you may chuckle) for the OP.
It has likely been resolved and new silver members should understand not everything needs commentary.

Over to the Moderation Team now.

Has anyone met a WL who you used to see walking on the streets?

Funny thing it actually happened with me today. I had a punt at Riverwood CT this morning and on the way back to city I saw at Central station Victoria, who I used to see her at Blacktown (I wrote 2 reviews). I was seating at the upper deck of the train when I saw her waiting in the platform. I thought for a sec if "should I stay or should I go", so flip coin in my head run out of the train to say "hello" and maybe exchange phone numbers, but too late she disappeared in the mass. Damn it!

So, what you guys would do if you meet on the streets a nice WL who you used to see? How would be your approach?

There's been a few threads on this topic previously. The general consensus seems to be that approach is not the done thing. Many WLs value their private life and remain anonymous away from work. Such an approach may not be welcome.

It probably depends on individual circumstances though.

Totally depends on the girl. Some have moved on and started a new life . If they want to talk to you they will.

Ok, mods please feel free to delete or merge this thread.

Yes agree that we should respect their privacy, but I was refereeing to a WL that I use to see as regular.

As Hard said do not approach!!
Remember the name they give you is not their real name so you will be the one who is embarrassed if they choose to ignore you.
I have run into many a gentleman I have seen I had a giggle to myself because I was shopping one day and a young guy I had seen was shopping with his mother.
I never ever say hello but will always reply hi in this instance as long as I'm alone otherwise you get questioned.

Thanks Leah, its good to hear advices from an industry person.

Agree that respecting privacy is very important, and was not my intension to be pushy or inappropriately approach her. She was by herself and it would never cross my mind if she was with someone.

The only reason I thought in saying hello was because I used to be her regular and we were close, but I guess the common sense here is not to cross the line. Lesson learned.

Stay clear, much like alot of members here who have partners, they deserve respect & discretion, no matter how you perceived your relationship, in the bedroom you might of got along really well, but it dont mean she will want that attention outside of her job, remember alot of working girls know how to get you back time & time again.

When I worked in the CBD (melbourne) I sometimes went to a lapdance place where the girls gave hJ, and some did FS.  One day when I was going back to my car, one of the girls was paying her parking ticket, and I tried to avoid her by walking very slowly, but she noticed me and said hello.  I was the one that was embarrassed, but did say hello.

I recently had the opposite experience to many of those in this thread. After I got off my train I was approached by a beautiful youngish Chinese woman who was very friendly and asked how I was and touched my arm. I was polite and friendly but couldn't remember who she was. After a bit of chit-chat I eventually asked her where we knew each other from and she said Enfield. I knew the (now closed) shop immediately but still couldn't place this woman. She told me she now only worked one day a week in a shop near Parramatta station. Later I twigged this was one of my favourite MLs of all time (Mr C&B was also a great fan.) I knew her as Sally but she changed her name to Lisa. It is probably 3 years since I had seen her and that was mostly in provocative shop gear or in the nude. Not the conservative and stylish clothes she had on. I am very sorry I didn't get her number as I would love to see her again and I very rarely get to Parramatta. First time this has ever happened to me. I don't know what she would have done if I was with someone.

it was the start of the NRL season this year I was in the  Eastwood business club they have a tinted glass area that you can watch all the beautiful young Asian girls walk past have a good look because they cannot see you ,perfect  for a perve especially on a hot day when they have white see through singlets & those lovely tight shorts they wear 
To my surprize who should walk past Lynn from 142  looking delicious in a summer dress , this girl knows how to dress.

because I have seen her for coffee before , & she was by herself going to do some supermarket shopping .
 I finished my beer to catch up to her Lynn was a bit startled  but also happy to see me also I said you take me supermarket shopping for some Chinese  tea& herbs & I will pay for your shopping  we had a fun day with all the different  Asian supermarkets there are so many very interesting hearing her talk in Chinese
I don't know what she was saying but they would always laugh so I might of been the butt of the joke still never felt uncomfortable .
 took her home saved her legs by car gave a kiss on the cheek and said my goodbyes.

Yes, it is reassuring to realise that sometimes we make a real connection with these ladies. I was stunned she recognised me. She must have had 100s of customers over the last 5 years and I would have thought most of us older caucasian guys would look pretty much the same to these younger Chinese women. I will make an effort to find her again.

Really now?!.. Interesting.. But then again expected.. Since Giselle comes from a real estate background.. And the crow bar was for sale two years ago.. Hence the current refurbishment.. Probably wanted to stick it to there other haunt Small Bar!.. Down the road!..

Should I see a WL from my old regular punting days I would give her a weak smile, by which I mean you smile with your eyes but keep your lips closed.

That signifies to her that you recognise her and leaves her with a variety of response options, which could be :
.  no response at all - either she doesn't recognise you or doesn't want any contact,
.  a weak smile back - an acknowledgement that she recognises you but doesn't want to initiate anything further,
.  a broad smile - which, assuming she's unaccompanied, I would take as an invitation to stop and say hello,
.  she smiles, stops and talks to you.

I agree with the rule of playing it cool and NOT approaching a working girl outside of work, unless she initiates it and you're both on your own.

Funny thing happened shopping yesterday. A tranny who lives close by, who I had seen, was in shop I walked into. It was bound to happen - we virtually live on the same block. When she turned around and we clocked each other, I gave the 'firm smile'/acknowledgement and she smiled back and started chatting to me. In fact, she had started teasing and flirting with me: "Are you stalking me?" she says while poking me with her Xmas cane. "Yep. You've got me." We made small talk, she walked off, then came back when no one was around and says "I really thought I'd see you again." I couldn't really say much, 'Umm, yeah. Are you still working?" Yes. "Ok, I'll try."

Point was, she couldn't take me in, said I was too big, and there's no point paying $150 for no sex. We kept bumping into each other and smiliing. I love her slim, tight body.

I saw her swan by another shop as she left, I left soon after, and I think she thought I was really stalking her as we were on different sides of the street, and she took a longer way home. When I got home I sent her a text saying I'd love to see her, but no point unless she dropped the price, and she was looking hot, and I promise I wasn't stalking her  She had me feeling horny.

Next day, I get a message back, agreeing to special price, no sex.  I say I'll be dropping by very soon... I look at the clock, think I can make a quick visit before the first race, then a mate calls and he wants to drop by. Damn. But this story will have more than just a happy ending.

She looked like a lot of 40 year old Chinese woman, attractive,  nice style of woman, ageing gracefully, minding her own business, doing her shopping at Coles.

Just  an ordinary Chinese woman . In the real world I would have no reason to even talk to her , let alone cum in her mouth.

In the alternate world of Chinese massage for a $50 tip you can know this woman very well indeed .

We pass each other with a hint of a smile and go about our business. I'm reminded of why I love punting. Sex with beautiful woman and no commitment .

I remember I ran into Mimi from Burwood in Burwood one morning. We were both very surprised but we had a brief, friendly chat before  she rushed off to see a customer and I continued on my way to see one of her old friends and another ex from 252B. It was one of the few times I have seen Mimi clothed and the only time I have seen her in mufti. An eye turner even in her street gear!

I had a similar Mimi sighting a few months ago. I was walking back to where I had my car parked and saw a striking looking asian woman dressed in tight jeans and blouse. It took me a few moments to recognise her because the ladies really do look different in their street clothes. In this case there was no question of saying hello because she was with someone.

Experienced punters have probably seen the reverse of this from time to time. You show up to see a regular and she arrives to the shop in her street clothes looking very different, unremarkable even. Then she disappears for a few minutes does her makeup, hair and puts on her working clothes and voila a dramatic transformation in a goddess

Wandering around the shops with my father of all people and I'm grabbed on the arm and turn around to find Ping from "Pink Pings Massage" standing there saying, "how are you? Long time no see! Why you not come any more?"

I was mortified to be honest as, of course, my father doesn't know about my punting - and I don't want him to!

I mumbled some excuses and got out of there pronto. Ping just laughed. 

Dad quizzed me on who it was and I made the excuse along the lines of it was one of my clients I see during my work life in the sales area of things and I hadn't done a "sales call" in quite a while. 

To be honest I was a bit pissed off. Ping's a good lady but respect and discretion have to work both ways.

That is very bad form, especially as she would have seen you were not alone. 

Surprisingly perhaps, given Canberra's toy town size, I have never run into any ML/WL on civvy street yet.  However, I did have a ML mention to me once that she saw me walking in town while she drove by.  It's not a big worry for me since I'm single and not breaking any laws, though my preference would be to keep my punting life discreet, so I'd be pretty annoyed if I got bailed up when I was with somebody else.

In the local shopping centre a while ago, and after buying a few things, saw a Chinese ML I had sex with a few times walking straight towards me, I saw her, she saw me, we both recognised each other, she put her head down and I did the same and we both kept walking. I must thank her for this...as I wouldn't know what to say...

U would shit yourself if a ML came towards U when your other half is with you...or think..."dear God. If U get me out of this I will...."

Not sure the strategy of not punting near home is an effective one as in my experience most MLs don't work near home for exactly the same reason. I nearly always punt near home and have only once seen a ML lady on the street. The danger of seeing a ML on the street would depend to some extent on which suburb you live in as different nationalities often congregate in certain suburbs areas as we know. Many of the ladies I see live in the Auburn/Lidcombe area which is well away from me.

I only knew of 1 ML lived close to where I lived and she was pretty cool. Same as what MB said...I punt close to home and most of the ML are from outside my area too but there is always a chance and depends if u r flying solo or with your partner....I have seen a ML walking back from the shopping centre to their shop...usually with a few bags of groceries...

My problem is as a local growing up in an area, being seen by someone who knows you, I am more worried about this than seeing a ML on the street.
A mate who punts even heard me chatting to a ML in a shop after I had finished...

Must confess I'm always amused at the paranoia associated with indulgence in therapeutic massage. I will say that personally, I would not bowl up to a known ML in the street and glad-hand her. That is simply out of respect for a woman's privacy.

However, I make no secret of the fact that I have regular massages. It's a healthy pastime. Often, I tell the gestapo I'm going for one... she doesn't need to know about extras!!!

I occasionally see MLs around Chatswood. Sometimes there's acknowledgement, sometimes not. Occasionally there's a chat.

If I were with the gestapo and a ML spoke to me... so what? It hasn't actually happened but if it did, it's not as if she's going to say, "Oh BTW, your other half fucked me senseless last week!!!"

Obviously my brothel visits are clandestine and an unexpected WL encounter would be more circumspect.

But each to their own...

Two of which have subsequently asked me for professional help to help set up their (post ML/WL work) businesses, golden rule don't mix work with pleasure and luckily they are no longer "in the game".
 My wife has met both! 
Always an interesting conversation as to how they became clients!!

 Sugar Daddy - Where have all the young Caucs gone ?
				
Post Content: 
Over the last 10years I have noticed a definite decline in the amount of reasonably priced ($300 hr) .  Aussie Caucs (20 - 30yrs, size 8-12) that are available.   Normally you would be able to always find a half dozen on cracker, backpage or locanto that would meet you in a 5 star city apartment for an hour of sin... At a stretch you could have popped  into one of the high end establishments like stilletos in sydney or Gotham city/centrefolds in Melbourne and get $300 for 45 mins....  These days, unless you have $500 in your pocket, your just getting a very basic service....

I do think that  due to  "Sugar daddy" and possibly other "arrangement sites" all the young smart caucs are going on the site and choosing their clients and the fee.     


Am i missing something ?  does anyone else have thoughts on this ?

It's simply supply and demand. Australia is a wealthy country getting wealthier so there's a lot more men with disposable income willing to pay more for a root. And unlike Germany we don't have several nation's worth of hot poor women on our doorstep willing to pop over the border for work. Instead we get lots of Asians which is fine if you can get a good one. But there's a lot of not good ones around too.
This only makes it worse as good Cauc girls are even more rare, hence pushing prices up even more. Someone needs to charter an A380 worth of workers from Hungary or Poland and set them up here for 12 months to balance out the market a bit

Fuzzynuts, I fully agree with your comments. I regularly travel to the UK and Europe, the abundance of working ladies, of varied nationalities, is simply amazing. Yes, some of the ladies from Eastern Europe would be most welcomed here, and they would make a lot of money. Why is it that quite a number of establishments can import girls from China for a few weeks and thus have a turnover of girls, which unfortunately all seem to offer the same. Where is the innovative entrepreneur willing to take a chance and import some girls from Europe? Young female backpackers all over Europe supplement their earnings by working on the side (or on their backs) so why is there little of this activity here? What we really need here is more variety.

It's pretty shit. Even the ones that are still around are not as hot as they used to be. Queensland does tend to have a lot more still than nsw and vic.

Totally agree to this, most of the girls I see are either teens or early 20s with the occasional older girls but they are plentiful up here & if your paying more then $300ph your paying over the odds. In many cases $150\30min is still the normal rate & mostly that's all you need.

I did dabble on Seeking arrangements just for curiosity, where I live its a far better bet then any other site, way more younger pretty girls available, tho the issue I found was a simple one, while you may make a arrangement, a lot never follow through tho a few did & I guess a lot where around $300 for a few hours, up to $400, a couple wanted stupid amounts but I won't lie I had some very pretty girls at bargain prices. But it can be a lot of work & a lot of false hope.

 WLs and PML transiting through call it a tour.
				
Post Content: 
There are numerous opportunities for partaking in a session or two with a lady who is simply transiting through a city or a town and puts an ad in that may appear to set the radar off for an opportunity to take a punt.

Having taken many punts in my day I was wondering what level of tweaking was the point that tips one over the edge.
For me the idea that I am setting out to a punt after having made contact with a PML advertising on the chance of earning a quick dollar or three turns my brain to alert when I get an unsolicited text or two saying things like bring an extra hundred or $50 if you want full body style. Can't get away from it lol.

Followed by "Can do therapeutic or Seems there's a call for it. And I can't seem to keep it without you guys getting excited. So either one is fine. Let me know. Will pop on a sexy dress if u want body to body. Am qualified too So can be whatever Just pricier obviously with nude and hand relief x"

Q How much is nude with b2b for the hour?

150 for the hour with no extras xx

Q What do you mean by extras?

Like a head job.

Reply to PML So nude b2b with relief $150 hr

Yes but will be like 40 mins massage then 20 hand relief. You can touch my boobs x

Response to PML You will be nude for the entire hour?

Just when I turn u over xx Will wear a lingerie dress till then


The above is an extract of a conversation text between a potential punt and a PML...

What would you do?


A./ Sure of course go ahead a punt is a punt It's only money after all

B./ Maybe need to think a bit more after all the goalposts keep changing and it may be a little dodgy

C./ Clearly making it up as she goes along perhaps meeting her and getting a feel first and then walking if it is suss.

D./ This is a no brainer get in get off get out $150 a punt who cares if it was only 25 mins including

E./ Perhaps this is a hippie chick or an old piece of strange trying to turn some time into cash at another's expense.

F./. Alarm bells ringing total timewaster who has no idea about massage save for pulling cock and thinks that should be enough just bullshit and take the money.


So what would you do?

Would you venture out or just cancel ? 

When you are in Sin city you have so many options. The great thing about living in Sydney!

If you are paying above standard market rates  then you should get better customer focused service.   Generally you get full nude from start for $50 extra so on top of $60 massage that's $110.  Most girls will happy to engaged naked from the start so why go through all that bullshit unless you are going to def get a Bombshell and outstanding service. In my experience your first gut instinct is correct  - pass on that one

Try a site like Scarlet Blue which has a reputation to maintain.

Or get a search in this review site about the lady in question for some intel

Or find a parlour/brothel that offers the services that you want. That way the main price is set by the house and you could of course get extras in the room. e.g you will get a fuck in a brothel but ask if its be or an extra. Anal will be extra and depend on the girl.

BTW the punt was in Coogee. I stiffed her as I don't enjoy being played by idiots.

She eventually figured that I was not going to show. Mind you I consider what I did as normally being very bad form but in this silly season my time is way more valuable than at other times of the year and figured if the conversation had by a com device was going to be the best part of the punt (it often turns out the anticipation is the anticlimax) then my time would be best spent elsewhere and not attending a punt which no doubt I would regret.

How prophetic I really dodged a bullet. Turns out this was not a transiting chick looking to earn extra cash but rather was Sabrina the T girl with fake everything including balls. 
It appears my radar is working really well.

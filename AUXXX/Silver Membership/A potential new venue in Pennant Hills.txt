Post Title: 
 A potential new venue in Pennant Hills
				
Post Content: 
Yesterday morning on the way to work, I was idly staring out the window of the train and as it pulled out of Pennant Hills Station, I saw some bright orange signs (hi-vis type orange) on the upstairs windows of a building in Yarrara St. I did not remember these being there earlier and I was sure that in the short glimpse I had I saw the word "Massage". So today I made sure to look more closely. The signs are advertising a business called Aja (or possibly Aya) massage. It is in the building next to the Wild Caktus cafe (on the right as you look at the buildings). Hornsby Council's website shows the documentation for the change of use from Art Gallery to Remedial and Theraputic Massage was submitted on 15th Oct and that the shop seems to have 2 rooms.

It might be our sort of shop - it might not be ...

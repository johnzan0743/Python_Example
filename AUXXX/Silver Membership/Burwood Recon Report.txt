So, last week my curiosity got the better of me and I called in. The shop is known as Sensai Thai Massage (both on the sign out the front and on their business cards, but from the advert, there seems to be more than Thai there. The door marked in the photo in the advert leads to a lift lobby with one small lift. The button for the first floor has a Sensai Thai Massage sticker next to it. When I walked out of the lift, I was inside the shop. straight ahead against the window were three or possibly four curtained off massage areas. To the right is a reception desk and beside that a curtained off area I took to be the girls' waiting room. The price lists stuck to the wall are in English and Traditional Chinese. The only obvious Thai influence I could see was a poster of Thai Boxing. Reception (a young Chinese lady) asks if I have a booking. I do not, so she tells me there will be an hour wait, so I decline and continue on my way.

It also turns out that in 41 George St's advertising on Cracker uses almost identical words - albeit in the simplified Chinese Script:





			
				是一家专业的按摩店，每天都有不同的四位按摩师在这工作，她们来自韩国，新加坡，泰国，台湾，中国，有中年  少妇，有年轻漂亮学生妹，每位按摩师手法一流，能让你解除疲劳，身心无比的放松和愉悦预约电话974416  66，营业时间：AM10：00-PM7:30
			
		

Perhaps the shops are related in some way. maybe the girls move between the places. My curiosity has not been satisfied. I will try another visit.

Interesting as this shop was always totally legit in my limited experience of it. I must give it a try if I can drag myself away from Cherry's girls at 48 The Strand. Thanks for the heads up.

Remember massageboy, this is all guesswork on my part. The lack of aural privacy due to the curtains may limit the "extracurricular" activities (although that wasn't a problem at a certain place of fond memory on the Lower North Shore ...). Still I am tempted to try. It is only a small detour from my usual journey home from work. Time will tell ...

This is the shop with the private lift that Ahlungor was saying his friend would take over a while back. Either it only happened now or someone else has taken over. It was legit before but from cracker ads, I would definitely say rnt now

I don't think this is the shop that Coco was looking at a year or so ago. That was around the corner in that huge complex along the railway line opposite the mall. Last time I looked that was still a legit Thai massage shop. I think this is the place virtually above the Westpac Bank on the corner of Burwood Rd and Railway parade.

Yes. Sorry you are right. I didn't look at the pictures. The place above/near Wespac is Sen Thai. The names are so similar I assumed it was this one.

Well then people, whoever has the time and resources please do check this one out, I'm terrible with new shops and definitely not interested in exploring any could be RnT or is it legit places !

Sorry, it's just me, chicken and no time especially all the way out to Burwood ! And the fact is even if I have a chance to make my way out there, there are 14 Concord, 48 the Strand and 8 Railway Parade all tested and proven, not taking any risk that's for sure.

And just for this shop from the OP, if it is through a small lifts and the place is partitioned off just by curtains then it sounds like the same shop that Coco was looking at, how things have changed now ! This shop had no current shower but had a very large toilet where they also have the washing machine inside and I was telling Coco that if she does take over, she got to convert this bathroom into a shower and then at the back of my head I was already thinking how much fun I could have there with Coco or Amy or both ?? All water under the bridge now !

So sad !

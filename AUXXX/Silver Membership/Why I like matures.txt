 Why I like matures
				
Post Content: 
In a conversation with a punting mate he asked why I like matures so much.
In perspective, he is the same age group as me but he loves cheap, young asians. He says it's the thrill of getting something that isn't at home.
Me on the other hand, I am single so I guess everything is a different experience.
I'm had some pretty fantastic sex, as well as pretty bad sex, with younger ladies, mostly at ATMC and Liaisons. It can be mind blowing to explore a hot young body knowing that the only way you would ever get this person to fuck you is be paying for it. 
Cheap asians are not really my thing. I'm going to try it again but I feel as though it is the "cum dump and dash" move for me.
Matures on the other hand, I have found more of a connection with. I find their sexual experience, willingness and work ethics to be a bit better than that of younger ladies and to be honest I just feel more comfortable with them. 
On the other hand I have heard a young bloke at work going on about how he likes the older ladies on Tinder as he loves the mummy, son fantasy. 
What about you guys? Are you older and go for the younger ladies? Or vice versa? I'll like to hear your thoughts.

Good question.

I like a bit of both. Some of the matures are excellent value (not just in $), and as they have been around, they know what they want, and what to give.

And then sometimes there's nothing like spending some time with a pretty young things too.

On balance, I probably prefer the matures. There was one French mature from SYdney who used to visit Melbourne... big busty lady. She wasn't much to look at (but would have been 20 years ago), but was absolutely first class in the bedroom.I find it rare to get that in a younger package, probably Olivia in Brisbane was the best at that.

I love to fuck mature Chinese or Asians as I get off on their twisted faces, genuine moaning and cumming as you poke their pussy with a decent white sword. Have never had one not beg me to return and many turn into freebies as they liked the way I fucked and treated them as special. Simple as that, treat them like the only woman in the world and it’s gold.

Twisted faces?

I've really only had one young un that I really connected with, German Bella out at Rydalmere. I hit the matures as well I might try some Asians but I don't expect much.

My thoughts exactly. While my experience is pretty much limited to the RnT area, I have a strong belief that the more mature lady offers a lot more than the youngsters (and particularly the 18-21 year olds) who make up for their lack of experience with an over-estimation of their own desirability. 

I consider two ranges of mature - the first in their 30's, often still gorgeous and with much more sexual development and worldliness than the "young things". They may not be cheap but, for VFM (and for my preference of a more "womanly" body) they would be my preference. Then there are the ladies in their 40's (or even 50's). With them, you can often get fantastic bargains with really great ladies who are appreciative of your custom - and often go off like a cheap alarm clock given the right attention.

Sent her a text, probably was 2017 thinking back, might have been early 2018 - she had stopped advertising though. She said outcalls only at that stage. Couldn't host her, so left it at that.

Responding to the original question, I have to say I like both Asian, Caucasian and mature WLs  However each comes with a catch.

Young Caucasian ones can come with princess syndrome so though they are hot but I am very sceptical of what they actually offer. There are exceptions of course.  So I usually I wouldn't try - Unless it is something that I have liked or felt that it could be value. Have had some good and some average experiences. 

For Mature WLs: My age range is max 50 and I don't like really wrinkly grannies - not my thing. However have had some amazing experiences with matures from old days in Amanda Heavens with Brigitte, and famous Paris- She was the best mature- milf I ever had. WOW- I still remember it. Vanessa at Harris Park was good as well but with change of management she has disappeared. I am very lazy to travel for a punt. So I really can't justify spending more than 10-15 minutes drive so never been to Cougartown / Belmore.

Asians: I was never a big fan, but Recently I found them to be of much better values compared to young hotties  ( In value I mean both service and money) so yeah I like little bit of everything!

I feel like both of these are an issue with a lot of girls doing this work. But I feel that their egos are propped up on punters making them feel like it so idk.

To the original question, with the few mature ladies I see, I generally think of them as comfort food. Generally speaking, comfort food isn't the most expensive, and isn't the most attractive, definitely rough around the edges. In fact it might not be the most tantalising for your taste buds either. But you know when you eat it, it will hit the right spot and leave you with a great sense of satisfaction. You could go expensive and get something that's much more attractive, well put together, and is punchy in flavour, but on the way back you might still yearn for some home cooking.

I honestly don't know if that's a good analogy but it seemed right in my head lol. But yeah, the couple of mature regulars I see don't seem to do a lot different in the service area. But it's just pure comfort being with them, cuddling, kissing. Not to mention the pricing is generally competitive too.

Likely because the mature ones trigger comfort like your Mummy issues have been or are about to be resolved. The other point may make senses is you feel more comfortable with peers that have life experience contrary to younguns who you share little in common with.

Post coital glow soon disappears when the oxytocin rapidly declines and you start viewing the wrinkles and age spots and signs of wear. In the glow of the moment and just before you climax you feel this level of euphoria that has you mesmerised and makes them appear like Goddesses giving you their all.....
Question begs What are they thinking?...

For me, I would say after climax, I tend to regret my punt only because of finances after.

Generally it's something along the lines of "why the hell did I just spend $300+ for an hour with a girl with a princess attitude, body odour, and because she's my age, she has the organisational skills of a uni student which means I've been cancelled rebooked and cancelled several times".

After being with a well priced mature women, when I'm in my post climax cuddle it's usually "gee that wasn't bad for [insert dollar amount], and it was so easy to organise. All I had to do was call."

Again everyone is different, and I tend to prefer a true GFE most of the times with a lot more intimacy than something like a PSE or escort experience which many young girls advertise for insane amounts and questionable deliver-ability. This is of course the typical case.

Hahaha... Not sure about your particular "Mummy issues" SR but Freud's Oedipus Complex never ends well, for obvious reasons!

As a 70yo mature living (sexless) with another cauc mature, the notion of sex with "working matures" has no particular appeal other than it's a different person.

I would apply that thinking to every punt. Intimacy with anyone... whatever race, appearance, old, young, etc., is each a unique experience in itself.

Note I used the word "intimacy". Apart from my intermittent punting and currently shafting a circa 50yo Chinese FB assures me that while she holds no resemblance at all to my mother (WTF!) she has almost every attribute I could ever wish for as a sexual partner.

So the question of why we like matures is entirely relative... just like every age we may find in our adventures. At any given time, I could be poking an 18yo or a 70yo. Does "age" matter?

I think not

Agree with you 100% Hard. Age has little to do with it save for experience. We all know we cannot put an old head on young shoulders ( save perhaps for a partial face transplant) and of course time equals experience. 
Now Freud May be instructive here ( yes it is still the basis of Psychotherapy. ) and other therapies. 
Some have the glow of knowledge and some the glow of greed. It's the ones who you feel relaxed with that give of themselves and allow you to feel good or even great about the experience..

The idea that analytical thinking can be done without a Freudian take is clutching at straws. Most things that involve analytical thinking draw upon Yungian Erikson amd Pavlovian theory. ... Freudian nomenclature is a tool used to initiate communications between client and therapist or Mental Health Professionals pissing in each other's pockets 

The relevance and take on punting is relevant when we feel this thing called guilt. Sometimes we feel this when we cannot really afford to prioritise punting and we spend the grocery money or holiday savings. Each of us possibly goes well that was a total waste of time or money. None of us ever has a totally deluded life suggesting that we all have moods and compare experiences.
Why else would this forum exist?

It's good to have security and with the accumulation of the course of life and savings we feel exponentially more secure the older we get. 
The moral is...To.... Above all enjoy your time with the punt. One day we will piss ourselves laughing and not intentionally... 

I enjoy the personality of complex people but equally have as many simple conversations that can be just as satisfying.

Would you like that sucked....Yes thanks...lol

I'm 66. Anything under 25 feels like paedophilia, anything under usually 35 feels like I'm a resource to be exploited. Between 40 and 50 is a sweet spot. Over 50 depends on how well preserved they are and I've seen quite a few over-50s who fitted the bill nicely. I agree that aesthetically age spots and heavy wrinkles are a turn-off. So are cartoonishly-oversized fake tits, especially the rock-hard ones that I worry will burst if given a good groping.

But personality and connection are very important too, which is why I find the cheap asian "sorry no english" punts a real let-down. If there's no conversation the post-coital letdown is lousy and I'm usually out the door 5 minutes after the main event.

Milfs in my experience don't generally carry a guilt trip and are usually comfortable to be themselves with no hang-ups.

My needs, wants, and tastes, have changed over a long RnT innings. My earliest experiences were all about the attractiveness of the therapist. 

My first RnT was with a beautiful blonde German woman. I was only 25 and she was 30ish. 

She wanted us to hook up out of hours. I was not so keen as I was married, and my missus closely monitored my spare time. Hence my punting was usually confined to office hours. I hand passed her to a bachelor mate, who was a notoriously successful pants man. He enjoyed a relationship that lasted several months. It gave us both, an insight into a world that we were otherwise ignorant about.

As time marched on, my RnT needs were all about ME. It was an escape from always having to be the seducer. I could just lie back and let the female pleasure me.

When I reached middle age, I developed a fetish for younger females. MLC ? Any RnT activities just had to be with a young and attractive provider.

As I matured my RnT tastes changed. In my non punting life I had a bad ending to a long term relationship with a much younger woman. This seemed to cure my 'younger female' fetish. 

My next phase was to seek out legit massage therapists, and attempt to eventually seduce them. These adventures were exciting, but very costly. My batting average was nothing to write home about, but when I would eventually hit a six, I felt like I had won Tattslotto.

Now that I am a SOC (Silly Old Cunt), I really enjoy the attention of the mature ladies. They seem to be particularly responsive to a more 'inter active' experience. 

These days I get a buzz when a therapist cums, as opposed to me being obsessed only about having my knob blown off. IMO they love the gentlemanly attention. 

Sure there are some shocking jackhammer rip offs out there. However, I find most older MLs generally know their way around mens' bodies. They are also very intuitive about what turns us on. 

Repeat visits nearly always render heightened levels of service and friendliness, and yes sometimes even intimacy.

My theory is that most mature MLs are sexually neglected in their private lives. A little bit of flattery goes a long way. They probably think that we are at least preferable to the disinterested old farter at home.

Very well put, Panch. In fact, many of the ML's in their 40's or thereabouts don't have an "old farter at home". Many have come to Australia leaving behind a failed marriage (and perhaps a child living with grandma) and they are often not looking for another relationship (unlike the young ones looking for an Aussie husband). If I think about those I know (and I am talking about ML's offering some extras, rather than BJ/FS ladies) most probably don't have any regular satisfying sex  

Once you have established a good relationship, you may be able to intrude into their panties and start to get some signs of real pleasure from them. They won't always be open to a good fingering - it depends on their hormone cycle (one goes off like an alarm clock in the day or two after her period) or time of the day (another lady will always have a shuddering orgasm if I get there at 10 o'clock, but not if I visit in the afternoon - some bastard obviously got in before me). So with these ladies, a little planning and a careful diary are essential. 

If she's not up for it, she will politely decline - or might consent to a little fiddling while clearly not being into it too much. On the other hand, when you have a successful session, it is absolutely clear that the lady is doing it for her own satisfaction (as well as yours). For those, like you Panch and I, that knowledge that she is really getting off on our attention is gold (particularly if they are pulling you off at the same time).

Interesting. Hovering around 50, and enjoying the presence of Asian ladies, I've spent time with some in the 25-30 range and yeah, there can be a bit of a disparity there especially as a 25yo will look maybe 20yo! On the plus side of things, a well-kept Asian woman in her 50s will look late 30s!

I suppose I am looking back at massage ladies I've seen as a customer, massage ladies I've become closer to and in some cases entered a (FwB) relationship, plus overseas liaisons from  Date in Asia and Blender often with women who are domestic help, so this is a bit of a varied sample. But I'd agree that 40s is working well for me.





			
				But personality and connection are very important too
			
		

Yes, very important. A connection of some sort is always good, especially for repeat visits. You can't underestimate the value of that. I'm sure many of us have had this thing where we meet a ML or WL and just seem to 'connect', and it's not some act of theirs. I can right now think of several with whom I developed a closeness beyond just being a 60 minute booking, in one notable instance the massage lady and I just seemed to 'click' on my first visit, and the session unexpectedly ended up going from massage to FS, and we ended up in a mutual FwB relationship for a while.

Again, quite right. They can be a bit more comfortable with their body and with what they are doing, and they appreciate somebody who appreciates them.

I've had a couple of younger Koreans (20's) like that. As if they were doing a huge favour, dropping their pants for $100. Shit attitude and dead roots. Dont touch this, dont poke that etc
I much prefer a more mature lass. Have a Thai girl in her late 40's, looks and body of a 30 year old. Great attitude, not a money chaser and an honest as they come girl. I don't go near anything under 30 and I only am interested in Asian lasses.

Unfortunately they're unable to tell the difference between they're and their! For us they are generally more "You fuck me now? I horny"

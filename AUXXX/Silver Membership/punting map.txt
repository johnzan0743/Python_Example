The founding member of the maps.. My bro SOO has long since retired.. But another member has taken up in himself to pick up the pieces.. From memory it was Charles.. I will have to check the data base to where he has placed them on the forum..

I've just been starting a new thread in the section to which they pertain. Mods have made some to sticky, but not all. So, if they aren't sticky, you'll have to scroll down until you come to it. Perhaps a mod will kindly make them all sticky?

It's been a while since I've had time to do any, as my work status has changed (which has also unfortunately negatively affected my punting and thus reviewing). I've done mostly Sydney and intend to continue on to the other states, but I just have to find the time!

If there's a particular area you want done though, that hasn't been done, let me know and I'll try to do it soon.

Cheers,
Charles

My apologies, I thought I had made them all sticky threads. Please let me know which ones I have missed and I will fix it up.

No need to apologise at all nextlife, I know how busy your role keeps you! 

As it turns out there are only a couple:

Therapeutic Massage Parlours, NSW, Central West

Therapeutic Massage Parlours, NSW, Southwest Sydney

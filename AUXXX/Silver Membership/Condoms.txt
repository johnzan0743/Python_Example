I generally don't like using condoms because they take away too much feeling....like having a shower in a raincoat as they say.....any advice or ideas where I can buy some that are REALLY thin would be appreciated.

You could try Condoms Australia. They are likely to have a bigger range than your local supermarket or sex shop.

I find skins or ansell ultra thin to be ok. Romans used to use goat intestine so we should consider ourselves lucky.

David the four seasons pink condom is the best condom a sex shop has produced in my opinion.  In doggy it feels like u are naked with this condom.

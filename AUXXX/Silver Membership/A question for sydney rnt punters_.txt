 A question for sydney rnt punters?
				
Post Content: 
Guys im just wondering if you still have a lot of rnt's run out of residential houses.   At its peak here in Melbourne 5 years ago , there would have been 30 rnt's run out of homes with no advertising out the front.  Now we have maybe 1 or 2.  We now have rnt's where theres advertising plastered all over the front window and girls dressed like there going to church.  Is the rnt scene still strong in Sydney?

I actually cannot think of a RNT run from a private home.  They are all shop fronts or a way smaller percentage of modified offices.

Thanks for your response chalk.  I just assumed some of your rnt's were run out of homes like ours were at the peak 5 years ago.  The rnt's now are run out of shop fronts with a man or women lieing on the front window getting a massage.

brauninc, as Chalkie says, most of the R&Ts in Sydney are operating out of the shopfronts or offices. But there is at least one operating out of a residential home - and it has been for the last 15 years at least (under several different owners). If I were to use the cryptic clues ( as the Victorians do on another forum), it would be something like "Oh the pain, the pain, the pain of it all in the Park"

Come to think of it, there are actually quite a few, there must be a lot more that I don't know off. But from what I know, RnT operating out of a private house with no business signs include:

Mimi from Burwood

28 Hope St Seven Hills (may have an Open sign at the front !)

In fact there were a few more in seven hills but apparently had been closed down like no 1 and no 5 at 138  ? Best Road!

The previous shop of Coco from Stanmore was also at a residential home at 55 George st Burwood with no signs !

These are just the one I know , there must be plenty more out there

Cheers

Is the Sydney rnt scene still going well.  Early 20's student types who do fs, or is it going the way here in Melbourne where the early 20's students just seem to do a clothed hj?

Need any tips ?

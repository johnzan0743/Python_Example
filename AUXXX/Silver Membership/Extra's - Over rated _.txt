Spont on.

These days I regard the company & conversation far more important than anything extras could bring me.

The connection through conversations can last a lifetime but the enjoyment of a handjob will only last a few moments once the booking ends. And then you walk out of the business in to reality.

Don't you two realise this is a review thread? If you want to talk about this crap please start a thread in General Discussion, or better still ....on another forum!

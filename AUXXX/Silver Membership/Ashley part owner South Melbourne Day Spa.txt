The intel I was given by this PML in Maitland was she was a part owner of this establishment.

I wasn’t sure if she was just yanking my chain but decided to do a bit of research for the Melbourne Members.y

Well what do you know this lass appears with her name on the ABN and clearly was trying to deny or distance herself from a couple of questions I had asked.

This establishment in South Melbourne is registered with the BLA and Council. It is a full service legit outfit.

Now Ashley has clearly distanced herself from this business but not legally.
It’s in her name.

She is hot but in a different way. Honest only however to a point.

The link to her review is here.  https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f116/...0-481-a-62004/



Please leave this intel in Silver. The issue of ownership of this brothel is a bit murky and requires delicate handling. 

Ashley is the owner in absentia. Don’t suppose she really thinks things through too well.

It is expensive but from what. I have been told the ladies are first class...

I’m betting she used to do full service. Anyone seen this lass in Maitland or Melbourne please report or review.

Thanks.

Enjoy.


SR.

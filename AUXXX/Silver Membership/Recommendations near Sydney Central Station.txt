Just a suggestion pizzaman but you have yet to inspire other members on the forum with your level of Thanks gratitude or even appreciation of a sense of humour.

The buttons at the bottom of your dialogue box are meant for use. Thank like dislike funny post chillax. Clearly labelled and you have yet to use any. 
Why is that? 
Acknowledging others who answer questions whose intel you utilise is going totally unappreciated by yourself.

I donâ€™t mean to be terse however the idea of this forum is to interact with others and that should include using some or all the tools of the forum.

Perhaps you are not able to read those tools due to the platform you are using.

Possibly you are not computer or tech literate.

To answer your question there are locations close to Central Station in nearby Chinatown and Surry Hills  Foveaux Street where you can find plenty of RnT action including Thai Massage TCM Medicine Clinics and Chinese parlours along with Kings Court in nearby Broadway. All within 10 to 15 minutes walking distance from Central.

Best of luck.

SR.

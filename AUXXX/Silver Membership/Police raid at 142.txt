Does anyone know anything about the police raid at 142 yesterday morning (10am)?

It's mentioned in the online edition of the Hornsby Advocate but I can only see the headline as I don't subscribe.

A little more here about it: https://pastebin.com/d6174p8r

Up to 10 plain clothed Police. Several women removed from the premises. Police checking identification. Police not commenting as investigations ongoing. From a witnes "They have been hanging around George St all day" (unclear if that is the Police or the women).

Maybe an immigration check. Time will tell

No one is trafficked.. girls work of there own free will but it is there visa status.. it is no different to working in any other industry.. holiday, student, spouse etc.. 

Please refrain from the gossip and innuendo that entails and is a stigma of the industry.. 

Until a formal statement is given and presented.. it is all hearsay..

I have to agree with SeaRay. There is an AFP officer that lives in my block of units. We often share a beer and talk. Yes, the AFP know who and where these workers operate. However they are more concerned at the bigger picture of illegal trafficking rather than the run of the mill, suburban massage parlour. Illegals and those overstaying their visas often get looked into, but, as he says, there are thousands of students and temporary working visa holders that never make an effort to return home. It's only when they get reports of things turning nasty, or other major occurrences, that they act. Let's hope nothing too untoward happened at 142.

Now you tell me.  I have literally just returned from my first punt at 280.

(How did you hear about this?)

Obviously very sad news for the customer and his family but it must have been very distressing for the girl.

Hornsby massage parlour raid: police launch 'large-scale operation'
Jake McCallum, Crime Reporter, Hornsby Advocate
September 13, 2019 4:33pm
Subscriber only
Police have raided a massage parlour in George St, Hornsby in a massive operation today.

A NSW Police spokesman confirmed a "large-scale operation had been executed by officers" around 10am on September 13.

A witness to the incident said approximately 10 plain-clothed officers raided the parlour today, as neighbouring business gathered outside.

"There has been women from the business outside waiting to go back inside all day," the witness said. "One told us police stormed the place and were checking identification of the women in the business.

"They have been hanging around George St all day."

The witness, who did not wish to be named said police knocked down the door of the business before storming the property.

"Police have been stopping people in the street all day,"

A police spokesman said no further information could be provided, "as investigations are ongoing".

Alleged drug operation at brothel dismantled - Strike Force Kilday

Monday, 16 September 2019 07:51:41 PM

A six-month investigation has led to the arrest of four people and the seizure of drugs and cash from a brothel in Sydney’s north.

In March this year, Kuring Gai Police Area Command established Strike Force Kilday to investigate an alleged drug distribution operation in the Hornsby area.

About 12pm on Friday 13 September 2019, police executed a search warrant at a registered brothel on George Street, Hornsby.

During the search, investigators seized cash, methylamphetamine, heroin and cannabis from multiple rooms.

Four people were arrested and taken to Hornsby Police Station.

A 28-year-old man, from Strathfield, was charged with four counts of supply prohibited drug, supply prohibited drug (commercial quantity), participate in a criminal group, possess prohibited drug, and be found on drug premises.

A 45-year-old woman, from Wahroonga, was charged with participate in a criminal group, owner/occupier knowingly use as drug premises, be found on drug premises, and possess prescribed restricted substance.

They both appeared at Parramatta Bail Court on Saturday 14 September 2019 and were refused bail. The woman is due to appear at Hornsby Local Court tomorrow (Tuesday 17 September 2019) and the man on Wednesday 18 September 2019.

A 49-year-old woman from Cromer was charged with supply prohibited drug and be found on drug premises.

A 34-year-old woman from Hornsby was charged with possess prohibited drug and be found on drug premises.

They were both granted conditional bail to appear at Hornsby Local Court on Wednesday 18 September 2019.

Police will allege that a sophisticated drug distribution network operated out of the brothel, where sex workers were utilised to sell prohibited substances.

Inquiries continue.

Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact Crime Stoppers: 1800 333 000 or https://nsw.crimestoppers.com.au. Information is treated in strict confidence. The public is reminded not to report crime via NSW Police social media pages.

Bad news.

But I think the NSW Police should be charged with criminal abuse of the English language.

In the above paragraphs alone there are several grammatical errors which render the paragraphs meaningless.

Sounds like the drug suppliers turned up to resupply (and a fuck) on the Friday 13th (mmm Didn't those idiots realise that this is a fucking unlucky day!)- in readiness for the weekend. I guess one of the girls that works on the Friday was the main contact. There's about 15 to choose from but I'd speculate that their brothel contact works both Fri and Saturday night to meet regular drug customers. 

Mmmm I heard rumours about some late night drug activities at 142 but I'm shocked that Mina would let herself get sucked into this - even passively.
It's really sad when greed corrupts an otherwise decent person. Nevertheless she may be innocent - lets hope so.

As much as I'd like to hope that Mina was an innocent bystander, I have to doubt that. Is it plausible she could not know what was going on? I'd say the best one can realistically assign would be total carelessness rather than cluelessness. Even if they play the sympathy card for Mina, I don't know how much ice it will cut (no pun intended). She's got a long-enough track record as a 'madam' to blot impressions. I actually thought about going up to Hornsby Court today to sit in the 'stalls' and get the latest first-hand, because of my past 'association' with her, but figured against it, it's just too 'risky'. Poor thing.

Roberto, maybe she will be lucky. The "allow premises to be used as drug premises" and "being on drug premises" charges both carry a penalty of a fine and up to two years in the Klink (or both). If I remember correctly the fine for the "allow" is bigger. The "participate in criminal group" can carry much more prison time, depending on how serious the criminality and how much participation there was.

Anyhow, the latest installment is out in the Avdocate. This is freely visible in the online version of the print edition: http://newslocal.smedia.com.au/hornsby-advocate/

I note that the 28 year old bloke (Jun Jia) was reported as having up to 250 grammes of methamphetamine. I know very little about drugs, but that seems like a shitload. He was also reported as being an employee of the business. Elsewhere it has been claimed he was the night time reception.

The three women have all had their court appearences as "mentions". Jun Jia has his appearences labelled as "Committal". As I understand it, this means that the Police present their evidence and it the Magistrate reckons it is good enough to secure a conviction, the case goes to the District Court for trial.

But all early days. The prosecution has to prepare their case. The evedence has to be given to the defence so they can prepare their defence (unless there are Guilty pleas). All this takes time. And the media will lose interest. The Telegraph and the Herald have already had their clickbait "Brothel, Sex, Drugs" headlines. Neither had anything about this in the print editions today. Nothing new on the Herald's site and the only new content on the Telegraph's site was in the local news section that is covered by the Advocate. It will be difficult to get ongoing information.

The Night Receptionist Jun Jia found with over 200gm of meth (commercial supply) if he is a user/supplier lower end of criminality. Non user/supplier highest end of criminality. NSW has the toughest penalties 25max with 15 on the bottom or life.The stark reality of being sent down usually kicks in during cavity search! Think I might sit in for Bail application Wednesday.

I am reading one of the news reports and I am not sure if having Viagra could be considered illegal?

...."with participating in a criminal group for the past year, being the occupier of a property knowingly used as drug premises, being found on drug premises and possessing Viagra."

https://australia.timesofnews.com/in...ies-of-drugs-2

Does this mean, any medicine that you carry could be considered illegal if you don't have the prescription for it? Maybe that's why they print your name of boxes whenever you buy medicine? I just found it quite strange that this could be seen as crime?

Mansion or not, i would think mina is shitting bricks at the moment. Two weeks in remand would no doubt have been “eye opening” to say the least. And i doubt very much that drug money was involved in the purchase of that house, more the the $$$$$ that us punters have handed over for the past  years. 142 would easily turn over $15k per day before the girls cut, rent etc. thats a very conservative $5m per year. Even if mina only got to take 20%, suddenly a $2m house isnt outrageous. 
And lets not forget that many of us have had good times with mina and i suspect that although shes turned a blind eye to goings on i doubt she is the kingpin or even very deeply involved. Not condoning, just reminding that most of us like mina and wish her well. Not so sure that jun jin is going to be quite so easily bailed though, but i know nothing of our legal process. Thise two other girls, my guess is the older one is Mia, also in deep do-do

For those who don't subscribe here is the report from the Herald:




North shore madam banned from her own brothel over drug raids

The owner of a north shore brothel has been banned from going within 200 metres of it, after police seized ice, cannabis and heroin and arrested four people during dramatic raids on the premises.

Min Van Campenhout, 45, was arrested at Hornsby 142 earlier this month and charged with participating in a criminal group for the past year, being the occupier of a property knowingly used as drug premises, being found on drug premises and possessing Viagra.

Ms Van Campenhout was granted bail at Hornsby Local Court on Wednesday on the condition that she stays at least 200 metres away from her business, which is a registered, legal brothel.

She is also required to forfeit her passport and live in the Wahroonga home she purchased in 2017 for $2.25 million.

Her daughter provided a $10,000 surety for the brothel owner's conditional release.

While raids on her stately Wahroonga home allegedly uncovered boxes of Valium, there is "nothing to link her to supply of drugs except that she owned the premises", the court heard.

Three of her employees - Jin Jun, 28, Waikwan Mo, 49, and Aiping Xiao, 34, have also been charged and are before the courts.

Mr Jun was charged with four counts of supplying ice, supplying a commercial quantity of ice, participating in a criminal group, possessing a prohibited drug and being found on drug premises.

Ms Mo has been charged with supplying a prohibited drug, while Ms Xiao has been charged with possessing a prohibited drug. They are each facing one count of being found on a drug premise.

Ku-Ring-Gai police commenced a six-month investigation after allegedly finding Strathfield man Mr Jun in possession of prohibited drugs, the court heard on Wednesday.

Subsequent phone taps and investigations by detectives reveal what police will allege was a "sophisticated drug distribution network ... where sex workers were utilised to sell prohibited substances."

Hornsby 142, which employs dozens of young women of mainly Asian descent, has been shut since the raids.

"Sorry we are closed for maintenance. We are doing further maintenance and will be closed," reads a post on the site's website, underneath an advertisement for a "special rate" for this week of $70 for 20 minutes.

Ms Van Campenhout will return to court in November.
			
		

I suppose it is a positive that there was no evidence found to link her to the supply of the drugs (other than that she owned the shop).

I did some research the other day and a "Criminal Group" is defined in the Crimes Act as three or more people involved in criminal activity. The penalties are up to 5 years or up to 10 years if you direct the activity. Only two of the people mentioned have been charged with this, so unless someone has been charged separately (perhaps someone higher up the supply chain), then I don't see that there is a Criminal Group to participate in.

Just thinking out loud. Mina will be bleeding money with rent on 142, legal bills, etc. i wonder if as has been suggested she can appoint a manager and get the shop going again. The shop remains a legal establishment albeit somewhat tainted at the  mo. The problem may be getting girls who would surely be gun shy of working at 142 in the foreseeable future. And punters who wouldn’t want to risk entering the premises. On the plus side the fact that its under investigation would mean that any further shenanigans would be unlikely. Its a chance for the shop to draw a line and clean up all the staff. No more party girls (thanfully). But the manager would need to be on the ball. Perhaos start small again, with just 3 or 4 reliable girls. And stop the 24 hour scene, and stop girls living on site. Maybe one of minas problems is shes too nice to the girls, they all say shes a great boss. She needs to be firm. Im hoping this isnt the end, assuming of course that mina doesnt end up with a custodial sentence. I fear that the supplier of a commecial quantity of ice however will be in jail for a long time.

I just looked at the website. Still seems functional. The "Closed for further maintenance" notice has been updated with today's date. Although the wildcard in all this is whether Hornsby Council will do anything at its meeting next Wednesday. So far, there is nothing about 142 on the Agenda for the meeting but it is probably not too late for more to be added.

It seems that Hornsby Council intends to do nothing. There is a report on the Advocate's website and the Local News part of the Telegraph's website with the headline "Council won't shut brothel after drug raid". The teaser is:





			
				A Council on Sydney's upper north shore has rejected calls to shut down a brothel at the centre of an alleged drug syndicate, recently raided by Police. Read their reasoning in our exclusive story [behind our paywall....]
			
		

The reporter (Jake McCallum) has also tweeted:





			
				A council that fought tooth and nail against several brothels from being allowed to operate in its CBD has rejected calls to see one at the centre of an alleged drug ring shut down. It comes as a brothel investigator lifted the lid. 
			
		

It doesn't say who called for 142 to be shut down, nor does it say who the "brothel investigator" was or what he found when he "lifted the lid". Maybe this will come out from behind the paywall next Thursday ...

Of course, if anyone here is a subscriber feel free to post a copy of the reoprt.

There was nothing about this in the print edition of the Telegraph today.

So, I have being doing a bit more searching. Some will not be surprised that a search on "Chris Seage" yielded a hit - albeit on a Chinese language website. When I fed "Chris Seage" and "Hornsby 142" to Google, it lead to the Telegraph/Advocate article. The snippet that was included in the search result was

One ot the Chinese language hits was on Sydney Today:

https://www.sydneytoday.com/content-101942529700001

My loose translation of the headline is "Sydney brothel has dark history. Insider says from the beginning not clean. Has workers (prostitutes) who do sex without condom". 

You can feed the rest to your favourite Babel Fish. I have not yet tested my translation skills on the full article, but the article includes Phillip Ruddock (the current mayor), Nick Berman ( the Mayor when 142 opened and Greg Donnelly (a devout Catholic member of the NSW Upper House)

Roberto,

I am guessing the name change is an attempt to distance the new iteration of the shop from the old. I do not know if it truly signifies a complete change or just a new sign on the front door.

Today I have looked at the Chinese language reports (another can be found here https://www.6parkbbs.com/index.php?a...iew&cid=991893 ). The Council reasoning (note this is the Council workers via a spokesperson, not the elected Council) was essentially that the drug  charges were a matter for the Police and the Criminal Justice System, not the Council's problem. 142 had a Development Approval to operate as a brothel and there was no reason under planning law that it could not continue to do so.

The report goes on to say that Nick Berman who was Mayor when 142 applied for approval opposed the approval (as did all on the Council except fot the two Greens members). There is also mention of the two tug shops on Edgeworth David Ave and how Council pissed a claimed $100k against he wall trying to close them. Chris seage make a mention both in relation to the Edgeworth David places and alledging that 142 was providing unsafe sex (ie BBBJ).

As for the continued operation of 142 after the drug charges, there is a precedent. Some years ago, there was a brothel approved by Parramatta Council in Sutherland St Granville (near Clyde Railway Station). The approval was for a two year trial period. During this trial period, the place was busted for supplying drugs. So the operators were charged went to court (I don't know the outcome of this) and Parramatta Council didn't renew the trial period. New operators took over the place, and applied to have the trial period renewed. Parramatta Council refused. The potential new operators went to the Land and Environment Court. The decision was that just because the earlier operators decided to sell drugs from the brothel it does not follow that the new operators will make the same decision.

Meanwhile the two Edgeworth David places continue to operate, no police raids, no drugs and no further media coverage.

The print edition of the Advocate is out. There is nothing in it about 142, so I suppose whatever the details of the story are, they will remain behind the paywall (although the Chinese language sites seem to cover most of the expected content.)

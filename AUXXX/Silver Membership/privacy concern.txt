 privacy concern
				
Post Content: 
Hey guys ive just found that if you do a google search of your user name and the website name you can bring up reviews you have written...

For most im sure this isnt a problem but for idiots who pick usernames a little to close to home or those that mention certain details in reviews it could be a real concern? right?

I’ve just googled my handle 

Luckily for me, you dirty bastards love to “Probe” the girls!!!

Remember bilko, the sponsors reviews are in the pubic domain!

See if you can change it to facesit or two fingers!

You’ll blend in to the background much better. Lol

Yep - affiliate's reviews can be seen by anyone.     You don't have to be logged on.

We can change a username - just PM me and if it's available I will change it.     Only allowed once a year.

Cheers

This concern appears to be a bit misguided. Unless you have posted in the affiliates reviews you won't be able to simply put your profile name into google and come up with a result. 
However if you put the subject of the review into a search engine then likely you may get a hit or some linked information that way.
Zip to worry about really. More chance of getting caught out by the gestapo....

not exactly misguided... as you said yourself if you post in the affiliates section its as easy as a user name and another relevant detail. 

Probe and Stroker have told me all I need to know to remain covert now so all good. Im sure others werent aware that the affiliates reviews arent private.

Not totally misguided (miss guided) just a bit (as in a little bit pregnant) misguided.

It is something however to bear in mind when posting sensitive information though.

As long as the post is entertaining and not malicious if you do ever get caught out that's what a shrug of the shoulders will be your response. That or dead silence...

 Bareback services- where do you draw the line?
				
Post Content: 
In this modern Ebola-ravaged time, several ladies pop up from time to time offering bareback services- ranging from BBBJ's to BBFS. Bareback anal has even been a past point. 

As fellow punters, what are your thoughts on the pros and cons on this subject. Think to feel better or does the big head outweigh what the little head wants when it comes to punting?

I know it's been done to death. But I keep getting offered it now. Is it me or the WL? No added cost either... Except my health I guess.

BB is always available at variable venues and with ever-varying girls. Everyone knows the risks. Everyone knows the odds are small. But..... always, caveat emptor 

Statistically, oral sex risk is low. BBFS, the risk goes up. Still low with sex workers. But the more you play, the lower the odds.

There are a bunch of other threads where this issue has been done to death. Personal choices for your choice of enjoyment... or disaster 

If you don't want the sleepless nights, don't do it.

 getting an std going bb in a brothel is not a risk, its a certainty. do the maths, even if the WL does bb with just a few others , and they also do it with others, .. iv had more than a few different stds over the years from WLs

Statistically, no more a certainty than BB out of a brothel. But presumably JIRAN, you seem determined to keep punting BB to achieve this dubious honour of "more than a few different stds over the years from WLs" of which you appear to be quite proud.

My post is absolutely clear. Don't BB if you want to stay safe. FMD

doubt that, if you bb a WL , odds on she goes bb with other customers . lets say 20 in a week.. statiscally you would be far far more likely to get an std, to the point of certainty,

Well JIRAN, obviously that's been your certainty if you have continued to contract STIs. Begs the question, why keep doing it??? Perhaps you're working for the jackpot.

I draw the line at BBBJ. When I am thinking rational I tend to want to avoid it...but it's one of my favourite sex services so it's so damn hard to deny the chance of it.

BBFS? I would never do it with a WL - just way too scared. In fact I only ever will do BBFS with a current partner at the time. Even that poses risks, although minimised risk to the point where I would consider it safe IF I definitely knew my partner well enough.


If a WL started doing BBBJ without even saying anything, 9/10 I will not stop them. Just too good. If they went for the BBFS I would immediately decline so I guess I still have some will power over the man downstairs!

personal attacks like this i would have thought should attract a warning ? or are there different rules for "unobtainium" members..

There are no different rules.

But members who continue to press their point may be answered more directly.

Evidence such as statistics published in a reputable place (not a Fairfax or Murdock chip wrapper) can be used to settle
this.

But I think it's pretty plain & has been done to death about a bazillion times.

Members should look after their health both for their own and the sake of those who love them (usually far more than one expects).

thanks for your concern ,this discussion isnt about my health or punting experiences, HARD claimed the risks of BB sex with a WL is small, i stated , based on my personal experience, BB sex with a WL is not low risk
if you didnt read hards post here is a quote

As much as i hate to jump into this rather silly discussion. that's not what hard said.

He said the odds on each individual encounter were small, and yes, BBBJ is lower than BBFS. but if you keep going, you increase your risks.

He's actually trying to give you some good advice.

My posts were not a personal attack. Simply stating the obvious. Anyone who persists in BB sex ANYWHERE with women in a multiple partner context runs a greater risk of contracting an STI. In a brothel or a Saturday night freebie down at the club.

A number of members post on this forum about BB sex and by your own admission, you have contracted a number of infections. Why would you keep doing it??? Of course it's a choice but everyone knows this sort of behaviour is a danger to yourself, WLs and other punters... and any cavalier posting on the issue smacks of hypocrisy.

If simply repeating these obvious facts is taken as a personal attack then perhaps a self-appraisal may prompt a timely review of cavalier behaviour. The only attack is on the risk posed to everyone by those who engage in unsafe sex.

So back to the OP, where to draw the line on bareback. Well for most, it's before you ever get an infection, i.e. don't do it. Perhaps others enjoy the medical treatment.

Best bj of my life was deepthroat bbbj. Had me smiling for days until the burning sensation when pissing, pus oozing out, kidneys on fire, I felt very unwell generally. Diagnosed with non specific urinary tract infection and given a single pill to treat. Infection gone when tested a week later. But I continued to feel unwell for months.  And I was lucky it was not a more serious infection.  BBBJs are awesome, but my health is infinitely more precious. Never again.

Common sense should prevail in these matters. No glove- no love. It still astounds me that people take the risk. On the other hand what difference is there if you go out on the town and bareback a seemingly promiscuous female? Money changing hands?

Only this one.

The professional lady needs to stay healthy to make a living (only saying the obvious that sex workers may be more concerned about and cognizant of risks to their health).

are we in some sort of time warp inter dimensional black hole - i thought it was bloody obvious where the risks lay - if you are willing to accept bbfs OR any BB you are part of the risk ... it's a two card hand, not just one card so to speak. wake up and be sensible. if you want to take risks do it - but you only have yourself to blame - take responsibility for your actions - they are the only ones you can really control. /end rant.

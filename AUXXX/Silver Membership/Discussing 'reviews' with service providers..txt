I'd suggest that this and the thread mentioned below (The CARDINAL SIN) are required reading for
all new members.





			
				Hi Fartichoke, fair point, it just came up in the conversation, I have no reasons to share the reviews with WLs. I saw a few members on PP mentioned they shared with the WLs, thought it is just a common thing to do.

Anyway, I will just keep the reviews between punters in the future, thanks for the reply

Fair point indeed. THIS THREAD probably needs to be a prominent sticky. It really is a nono to discuss reviews with WLs and MLs unless they openly advertise and welcome critique.

"The Cardinal Sin"... compelling reading

Great review with loads of intel, Kakuic.  With your people skills, I couldn't decide if you're in HR or a spy.  

I echo fartichoke's point about not mentioning reviews to MLs/WLs as a general rule, however.  I write mine as fairly and honestly as possible, so usually would prefer the subject remain oblivious to it.  Of course, there are a number of declared industry persons who are members of the forum, and no doubt many other undeclared ones lurking as well, but as a general rule this is intended to be frank and fearless advice for the benefit of other punters.

Keep up the good work.

Very true about the reviews and not mentioning them to the girls. There's a punter on here that is very close to Melissa and seems to relay everything said on here about her, straight back to Mel. It's now made me reluctant to say anything at all about my Mel visits now. I'd love to say a few things, including criticism but am reluctant because it gets straight back to her.

That's exactly it, if you think/know what you say here will get back to a lady, especially if she is a regular or you plan on seeing her at least a second time, then it can cause you to self-censor and not make any criticisms or comment on shortcomings (which may be useful intel for other punters) -- or just not post any reviews at all (outside the Gold Lounge anyway).  Also, if they can work out who you are from your review, then they can see who and how many other ladies you've been seeing -- I never claim to be a one-WL/ML guy, but don't want all my exploits exposed!  

Out of curiosity, lofty, did Mel herself mention some doofus was leaking info from here?  Maybe you don't want to answer that in case the leaker is reading this thread...!  

PS. Sorry, I realise this thread has been diverted from Sophie but it's an important issue -- maybe it could be carved off as a separate thread or tacked onto The Cardinal Sin?

Just to clarify, I didn't mention any details of the reviews( Date, critic name etc ) nor did I mention where I read the review. She asked me whether I had a good time, I told her I did, and I read good reviews about her, the reviews were spot on. 

Personally I agree with the above posts here, won't discuss anymore.

I have mentioned this forum to a few WLs and for the most part they're not only aware of it (and others) but they're generally interested to find out what's being said. I guess it's self-improvement or professional development or something

One WL did say that another punter who could access this forum from his phone (I still haven't sorted that, and in any case mine's in flight mode while I'm in a brothel) showed her my review and the only dispute she had was that her tits were a C, not a large B. I didn;t argue as one of them was being thrust into my mouth at the time. After that it was a great punt at least in part because it was an 11/10 review and I think she appreciated the other things I said. She now also spits and dribbles a bit more during BBBJ as a result of my review so all's well that ends well ;-), 

I live in no fear of this because I've only ever discussed it with girls who've gotten glowing reviews from me. If I posted a dud review then I'm far too gutless to ever fess up to her face!

In any event, if she doesn't like what the reviews are saying she'll soon rebirth herself under a different working name.

I second this - while reviews may help in certain circumstances (e.g. restaurants, gyms, hotels, etc) I don't think it will help if you let the provider know about what other ppl say about their service. I think there are ways of letting a provider know her service is shit (by not getting any more customers, etc)

If the review from me is good I don't see a problem - the girls like positive reviews. If I've posted critically then I'll plead total ignorance, but on the other hand if I've posted a bad review I probably won't go back to cop the flack.

To me, that's a very one-sided view. I doubt the idea that "girls like positive reviews". In fact, I would think that unless they are private WLs who advertise their services, most girls would hate the idea of being discussed openly on the internet... this would especially apply to MLs working in a massage shop for example. Believe me, I know a large number of MLs to know this would be true, even though I've never discussed reviews with them. They are private and discreet about their work. It's partly for this reason that my MP reviews are in gold to limit the chance of wide circulation about the privileges I am given.

I think the that most senior members agree that discussing reviews with providers is the cardinal sin (Cardinal Sin), but there are personal reasons that should deter members from doing so also.

The first thing that showing a review to a provider does is place you in a submissive position: you have offered something valuable
making your willingness to do things for her clearly understood.

Will you find it easy to refuse any requests after this ?

Also, in making a clear gesture of solidarity with the provider, how can you resist being influenced
by her opinions and attitudes. You have sacrificed your independence and begun to be a doormat !
Better watch out for the exit signs before the lights go out.

This illustrates some of the hazards of a relationship with a provider. But by gifting her intell, you have indicated
that you want to extend the scope of the relationship with her.

How on earth are you  going to back out if this is not what you want ?

Please consider the advantages and disadvantages of a relationship with a provider carefully before 
you decide to show a review to a provider.

Very good points farti. I agree entirely. Nothing I have read on this topic has ever offered a reasonable explanation as to why a punter would show a WL or an ML a review of her. Nothing.

If a sex worker is interested, she will seek it out for herself, usually because she's affiliated and has access to her reports. But as mentioned earlier, MLs particularly are not aware and/or don't want widely-distributed attention.

The practice is for 'big-noters' and I would simply repeat what I said earlier...

As demonstrated with what has happened with me and Katniss, farti. For everyone else's enlightenment, I recently read a review of a Malaysian hippie chick doing massage in Randwick. Went up to meet her and we got chatting. We were getting on like a house on fire and she asked where I got her contact details. I mentioned this site and she was full of curiousity. After the massage I showed her her thread. She visibly altered, reddened and agitated. I contacted farti - and in the process got a bollocking from admin here, but that's beside the point - asking to have her thread removed. Katniss, meanwhile, shut up shop for awhile - she says she'll be back in a month or so. The end result? A provider is miffed and out of action. The admin here is annoyed at me. And I feel like an idiot with a vague sense I've been taken as a fool.

Without going into details, that is not how the full story played out.

Moving on.

We have been running this forum for a long time now.
I have said this before and no doubt will say it many times in the future.
These workers are happy to take the money to pull a dick. They are happy about a sudden increase in business until some dipstick blurts out about the reviews.
Suddenly she has never pulled a dick, will never pull a dick, has never seen a dick.
Suddenly she is stressed, leaving home, the shop, the state or the country. Suddenly she has a family, husband, mother, goldfish etc...
If it was a negative review as is often the case when a dipstick shows a worker a review to get a better service.
Then poor old me has to deal with the fallout from the worker. Pissed off people are not the nicest of creatures.
Legal threats, physical threats, unintelligible screaming over the phone, hourly emails etc...

If a worker has 20 reviews by 20 experienced members saying she pulls dicks, you know what? SHE PULLS DICKS!
If i was to remove all the negative reviews of the virginal non dick pulling workers you would not have a forum.

Maybe i should start charging a monthly fee to exclude the non dick pullers from the forums.

SOW, you outed yourself in your above post, not any of us.
If you thought i was annoyed at you before, then imagine how i feel now after your public cry.
I do not like starting my day being expected to hold the hand of a member who did a dumb thing and expects our team to clean up your mess.
Your started it, you deal with it off the forums because it is your mess that you created. 
How many times has this been discussed across all the forums over the last 5 years? yet people still do it and blame the very resource that helped them find that worker.

SOW, If you wish to continue this then i suggest you do it directly with me via PM.

Post Content: 
My opinion is. We should not discuss reviews indvidually with PML or PWL howerver I think the fact that they know about us can be highly productive. If you have a common business and someone give one of your employee's a bad review you will try to understand what happened with your employee. Same thing here. For me if they know they are good and they are been criticised for setting their prices to high because they are becoming very popular. They should know that there are people onlinetalking about it and it will reduce their clientele. Knowing that they can take two attitudes: don't give a shit or reduce their prices again. I believe they don't need to know the name of the forum or even the specific reviews but know about a site doing that can be good for us and increase the service standards.

There is a distinction here that has been mentioned but perhaps not fully fleshed out. The distinction is between PWLs who advertise their services openly and others, who operate under another banner... a shop front, an agency or some MP newspaper ad or private ad. Being transparent on the internet means PWLs have to cop the reviews... for better or for worse. If their service is good then they will benefit from the corresponding reviews. However they cannot blame anyone for negative reviews... they are out there and they must take what comes in the form of review.

This forum has a very high presence of massage parlour business and is therefore the target of dicks like Seage and other bullshit so-called "investigators". It must surely be obvious even to a blind freddy that these providers of ANY "sexual service" don't want public exposure. WLs in a legit brothel may be justifiable review fodder for discussion - because it goes with the territory - but MLs are not. Any privileges received in a massage parlour or from a PML are exactly that, privileged. It is one thing to write these experiences up here in a review for like-minded discreet punters. But it's entirely another matter to go sprouting your own or other essays to a provider in some vain or stupid attempt to gain greater privilege... even assuming that's the reason for doing so. As mentioned before though, it's really just big-noting.

The above story is a clear case in point why this practice is plain dumb and as shown, can ruin the situation for the worker, for self and everyone else.

Please... note that this is not an attack on any member who has done this. We've all made mistakes. Let's just all learn from this lesson.

It absolutely amazes me that people here are still not seeing the full picture. 

People saying if it is positive review it doesn't matter. 

People saying that girls knowing about these sites benefits the service and can keep prices down. Sure that could be true but the truth is most girls are doing this privately and will never want another person to know. That includes f/a girls and ml and all other types. 

It's simple. Don't mention reviews or this site. Whether it is specific to this exact site or not it doesn't matter. Overall the outcome that is better for the punting ommunity and WL/ml community is that if this is kept discreet the way it was intended. 

Where did you find my number? How bout a friend have it to me. The fact that you were suprised by her reactions is what astonishes me. How would you like detail descriptions of your PRIVATE life posted all of the Internet. That is exactly what we are doing. Hence the reason I often can't review girls I get along with so well because of the moral dilemma I face when disclosing private details with a bunch of randoms on the Internet. 

Sorry to rant. And I've probaby said this all before in the cardinal sin thread. 

Anyway. Happy punting everyone.

good post hard. Its important to distinguish between brothels and massage parlours advertising. And to further distinguish between businesses advertising on forums and those that aren't. The implications are obviously different for a worker if there is a discussion about financial negotiations for sex in an advertising licensed brothel as against a private girl working in her own home and not advertising on forums.

The case above, involving me, has been cleared. All sorted and admin aren't going to waste any more time on it. My point was always that a discussion about a financial negotiation for sex ought to be kept off a massage thread. I feel some of the things I said were taken out of context. 

On the broader topic, I think there is a big difference between showing parlour girls reviews and independents. Parlour girls are employees and are confined by the work restrictions of their employment. For example, if BBBJ or DFK is known as a standard service in a parlour then she is under immense pressure to offer these services. We all know of parlours in which girls who don't offer the standard services expected there don't last long at that particular parlour. A large part of the pressure she is under comes from the reviews on forums. I know this is true. I think it is irresponsible to wave reviews around in brothels because of this. The less the workers know about what is being said the better.

But independents are under a totally different pressure scenario. Their business depends on discretion. Discussions on forums can either make or ruin their business. Make it if they benefit from the noise generated within a target audience. But ruin it if their private residence of safety is compromised. These independents operate on a one to one basis. Contrary to the theme of this thread, I think they ought to be brought into the discussion so they can have a measure of control.

I don't want to bang on with this topic ad infinitum but I would dispute this notion of "standard service" in a MP. The standard service is massage. Nothing more. Of course we know that much more goes on but this is precisely my point about privilege and precisely why the results of such privilege shouldn't be shown to the provider. We have enough trouble with the so-called "investigators" reading and misusing our reviews. The next step would be to say we can't post anything about extras in a MP... but we know we'd then have no forum. At least we have an earned structure where some level of discretion can be maintained.

I'd also seriously doubt that girls are sacked because they DON'T provide extras. I know of a number of cases where exactly the reverse is true... they're sacked because they DO. Extras are always by choice at the discretion of the girl... and should always be so. In fact, if I knew a shop owner was INSISTING girls provide more to pump up business then I would probably have something to say. Why? Because that then is verging on control, coercion or worse... and is illegal by law.

I am not sure that it's been mentioned, although AdminXXX has alluded to it, but this is a site to serve the interests of punters.

It's an alternative to all the lying advertisements and offers at least some perspective on how well the product meets the claims.

In response to your last question... almost certainly can be taken with bags of salt . Unless referenced to a review site, then they could simply be BS. At best, carefully handpicked, they're not likely to link bad reviews. And yeah... "lying advertisements"... haha, how we've all seen those

I guess farti's question gets to an issue that is easy, or rather I've easily, confused. I tend to spend a lot of time up in Hornsby at Mina's. I see WLs there and write reviews. I'm honest in my reviews, but I must concede that I wouldn't be human if I weren't affected by my friendship with Mina and Amanda. I tend to find excuses for poor service and am loathe to criticize individual workers. I've seen first hand how tough it is for some of these girls and I'm naturally sympathetic with them. But that is not what this forum is all about. It's a punter's forum, as I've been reminded, and you expect dispassionate reviews.

But I honestly don't think punters here on this forum are journalists. It's impossible to give an absolutely fair report on something that is so emotionally charged as a sexual interaction. Sexual need and desire is so deeply ingrained in ones accumulated experience. You don't need to know anything about Freud and Jung to realise that our sexual expression taps deep into our psyche.

All we can do in a review is give the facts and an impression of the interaction. That's what I look for in reviews and what I attempt to provide in my reviews.

That's for WLs. I realise it is different for MLs because they are playing a different game. Hard talks about privileged services. I guess that is as good a way as any to describe it. Punters are angling, fishing, for those privileges. The MLs success relies on not giving too much a way, but nevertheless keeping the fisherman interested. It's a much much more delicate game than brothel workers. 

So writing reviews for MLs is much more problematic. Giving the facts, the advertised facts, and a general impression is not enough for the fishermen. They, the punters, want more from a review. They want some clues as to the best lures to use. I understand that this is what the boys' club on these forums is doing. No problem at all.

Where I reckon I'm being misunderstood is simply that I think punters do retain a responsibility to the service providers. In every circumstance, everyone's safety and integrity must be maintained. My saying that independents should know what is being discussed about them was purely meant in this context. I didn't mean show them reviews - and I concede that I made a big mistake in showing Katniss her thread. But, and this remains my big but, I showed her the thread because she expressed fear. She thought her safety had been compromised. I should have handled it differently. And I should have explained it better to this forum. She, as an independent worker, does need to be in control of her situation. Even if this is a punters forum, that remains true.

Providers should know what they are getting into PRIOR to embarking on such a career, especially if they are fearful of reputation and safety. They need to take responsibility if they provide services above and beyond straight massage if they are chasing money.

The only mistake that was made was yours which you now admit and I hope see clearly.

I suggest everyone just move on and learn from this experience. 

Never tell providers about reports on these types of sites and never, ever show them to providers.

Agree with your last post SOW and well spelled out. Thanks!

That was the point I was trying to make about MLs. Having spent absolutely countless hours on massage tables and having experienced absolutely everything there, I thoroughly understand the sensitivities - and the privileges - inherent in those relationships. Yes, it is quite different to the WL experience where most things are pre-determined. Your comments about the sexual desire and the potential emotional charge will touch deeply anyone here who has gained a very privileged relationship with a WL or ML. Mostly we want relief and out. But some contacts create an entirely different experience. I've had a few of these and I have to say that such deep intimacies of mine do not get posted on these pages

Before moving on (hate that expression because it's just code for "I'm not interested in what you're saying so stuff you." This is a discussion thread, after all, so it's appropriate to flush out issues) there is a question I think ought to be answered by those who are so quick to criticize. How do you respond to a service provider who expresses a fear? If she, or he, tells you that she, or he, is in danger, what to you do?  For any regular user of providers of sexual service this is a real scenario. Sexual service providers place themselves in vunerable circumstances. Some punters cross the line. How do you, as a responsible member of the community respond?
And before the hoary old line comes out, "they knew what they were doing when they signed up for the job." True, but there are always unexpected consequences, always situations in which you lose control. I have certainly been in that sort of circumstance and it scared the bejesus out of me. Can only imagine how difficult it is for someone who has put themselves outside the law - and that's what some of the independent operators are doing. How do you respond?
If it's clear cut then you go to the police. If it's not so clear cut, do you just walk away from it with a "it's not my problem" attitude? What if you later hear in the news about an assault? More likely you never hear anything again, and never see her again. Isn't there a guilty conscience lurking somewhere?
And you know that 99 percent of the time it is a play for sympathy, a tactic to lure you further into her power. Then what, do you still ignore the one percent possibility that she really might be in danger?
It's not such a hypothetical situation. I've seen 1000s of working women in my time and I can say that several have been in very precarious circumstances. Twice I have helped women out of sexual slavery. I've also helped women out of situations in which they have been powerless. But I ain't no saint or crusader. I'm just a horny bloke who likes buying sex. Most of the time it's just pay up, lie back, release and out of there. But there are times when one's social conscience, no matter how hardened, is alerted.
And one more thing. How many service providers haven't heard of the Internet? How many don't know that these forums exist?

With all due respect, it would seem from what's been said that the fear about which you speak did not arise until you showed Katniss the review thread. That's how you wrote it. Enough of that.

For what it's worth SOW... I would suggest we leave this thread, lest you dig another hole for yourself. "Fear" and personal threats as you are describing now is a mutually exclusive topic from a discussion about whether it is smart to  talk to providers about forums. In relation to your last question, I would suggest many. Not all young, short-term visa holders are as smart as old farts who have been around the punting fraternity and the WWW for an eternity.

I would suggest that the mods close off this discussion which has run it's course, quite frankly.

I can't help but put in my last 2 cents.

'I showed her the thread because she expressed fear' - She expressed fear because you brought up a site she knew nothing about which you seem to still think you were doing the right thing because it is allowing the indepandant girl to have control of her circumstances in your words.

'How many don't know that these forums exist?' - I would say alot dont know these forums exist. And alot of the ones that do know hope they are not getting reviewed.

Now this is what Pisses me off big time gents.

We have a member that shares reviews with a service provider.
He gets in the poo.
He demands that we delete the reviews of other members, bearing in mind that he has not submitted his own review of the provider in question.

This twit was the final straw that lead us to introduce the "thread banning" option/rule which can be seen here. 
http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f39/ne...r-fires-33180/
This was introduced to protect the members that had the occasional brain  fart.

Now as all idiot non conforming twits do, he has taken his complaints to shops that are not involved in his brain fart. He feels that his fuckup and our lack of covering his arse are grounds for advertisers to cancel their advertising.
All this because of the 18,500 threads on this forum he has been banned from 1. Yes One, one bloody thread and now because he did not get his own way he is out to discredit the entire forum.
Well done pal, there should be a show called "serious adult forum fails" on Foxtel...if there was you qualify. 
What a dipshit, seriously does he not think that we have relationships with many shops? shops talk with shops, shops talk with punters, punters talk with punters?
Does he not think that we provide more income to their shops than he does>>> Epic fail 

The member in question had not been banned from the forum. He was banned from a single thread that he was using to force his way after he fucked up.
Congratulations member, for your efforts you have now gone from banned from a single thread 1 of 18,500 threads, to banned from them all. 

I/we will not be bullied by some silly old wanker for your personal gratification. 

We do not like to air grievances publicly for the members benefit, however as this member appears to have malicious intentions i make my comment public.

Now all i can say is i hope the member had a good tug because it has cost him dearly.    

Enjoy...

I have only recently returned to the (AusXXX) field via a short stint in Bronze having been benched in relation to an unfortunate incident relating to this topic. I followed up an ad from a private ML in my suburb. I Googled the mobile number and found that it related to a previously reviewed ML (with a different name but similar description. I visited the lady, had a most enjoyable (and quite specific) service and posted re same on this site. Another member (identity not known) visited her and demanded the same very specific service because he had seen it described on this site. When next I booked she was not so friendly but agreed to a booking. When I turned up she confronted me with the fact (which I could barely deny) that I had reviewed her, that this had caused great difficulties for her etc etc and do everything short of physical harm to have me persuade the good admins to transfer the review to "inactive" and remove the number. Unfortunately, due to my lack of reading messages from Admin, I they were left with the impression that I had shown the ML the review (which I hadn't) and I was red-carded.

Now it seems the lady is operating in the same suburb under another name and has been reviewed on this site. I texted her this week (not knowing it was the same lady) only get a return message along the lines of "Get Fucked! Rude text follows!". I quite liked the lady, she provided a great service and she was just around the corner. But now I am on her black list because some dickhead showed her (or referred to) a review.

Hi Billabong,


Sorry to hear about this incident and I can understand your frustrations.

May be this is a lesson learnt, don't try to be too specific on your review (so that the lady can't pin it down that it was you who posted it) and if you feel that the lady is giving you something very special - on this occasion, some sort of very specific service - then perhaps you should have kept that to yourself and not share in the open forum.

Now, let's find you a replacement lady so that you can move on ok !!

I normally include the day and the general time. My reasoning is that this information helps readers with the timetable availability of the worker; and provides an insight into her service (there are some providers who give radically different service from day to evening - and vica versa).

I always include the date... which of course indicates the day. I almost always ask a provider what other days she works and include that info in my review. I often make reference to time-of-day in the text.

To me, this is fundamental information that should be in every review. It saves the otherwise inevitable phone call... "What day does Sexy Susie work? You know, the one who gives good head..." etc. etc.

Without wishing to labour other issues discussed previously on this thread, Billabong Bill's recent bump of the thread's primary issue is a good reminder...

NEVER DISCUSS FORUM REVIEWS WITH A PROVIDER... ESPECIALLY MASSAGE SHOP WORKERS

While approved brothels and PWLs who advertise openly might be excepted, I must say I find it rather distasteful that shop owners offer incentives for favourable reviews. But yes, I know... that's been done to death elsewhere... sigh

I would urge members posting reviews of a PWL or especially a PML to take precautions against being identified by the lady from your review should the schizer hit the fan....Remember, she probably has your phone number...

You can do this by just posting just the month and excluding the date of your review (acceptable to Mods) and not mentioning anything that you think might be individual to you. Eg, your nationality, distinguishing features or a 'special' service you might receive, time of your appt etc...

Hard has made an excellent suggestion in adding what days the lady works etc...very helpful to anyone wanting to book the lady, and covers the omission of the date.

There will always be a turd somewhere who will show a review to these ladies for a multitude of selfish reasons, and from my experience you do not want to be caught in the carnage that is inevitable when it happens.

The idea of Gold is for the extra bits that don't get provided to the wider audience - unlike the open forum you have to earn the right to be in Gold so any extra curricular activities are safer as we don't want some of the trolls/leeches out there seeing. 

You have done lots of reviews SOW so maybe you are ready for an upgrade.

Hard is right the Whiskey definitely better in Gold

Interesting. Sounds like Billabong described something extra.

At least here the TM forum have some restrictions, but I'm still reticent to include some detail where I think it's more of a connection/YMMV thing rather than a girl's standard service - less some other idiot goes in demanding that.


Now I suspect for some of the girls it is a semi- standard service to keep the bookings coming versus other girls in the shop, for others it's something special (well at least it helps your ego to think so)

Albeit the silver forum is so quiet I'm not sure whether anything there would even get read, is gold different?

Moz good idea keeping the YMMV stuff back if you think it isn't the standard service, this can lead to issues for the lady as described below. As I said in gold we may add more information/ activities that have occurred, even gold not everything is said. I still keep back additional extras that I have received and don't want others to know about.

The reason people are able to get into gold is that they have proved themselves in both reviews and not being a dickhead, so the mods try and remove trolls from list.

She said she would like to know how well she gave head, how well she fucked & in certain positions, how well when she was licked out she showed she loved it...she said when she gets a full time partner his enjoyment would be very important so in ways fucking alot of men was a trial as to what they love about how she fucks..Interesting views she had.

Why the fuck would anyone review her without ID her? This young girl sounds lacking in confidence about her abilities. If she wants to know how well she's doing... er... why not ask the client?

Ive had a look at this place on google maps, what a wonderful looking part of Sydney, york  street is situated in.  I know it's almost unheard off for a punter to fly interstate for the sole purpose of intercourse in a shop, but he would be going a bit far, just to visit this place for a wristy surely lol.

Mate, if you make your way to Sydney, there are a few places I like to recommend you to put on your list - only RnT of course :

1B / 139 York St QVB, Cherry is a darling and she is my current favourite and the Vicky/Nicole mamasan double @$100/30 min all inclusive is the best value RnT experience in this country !!

227 Broadway - the absolute 5 Star venue for an Asian RnT, enough said.

Candy at VIP Pyrmont - the only remaining master of RnT in both part 1 and part 2 - after the recent retirement of Coco and Mimi - very sadly.

8 Railway Parade Burwood - at $90/30 min, the best value caucasian RnT shop in town, and it's the only shop using the two holes massage table at this price range.

Last but not least, Rebecca at 14 Burwood Road Concord - the Spanish Service Queen in my very humble personal opinion only...............haha


So, you think you can tick all of them off in about a week next time you visiting Sydney ??

Cheers

Jasmines in Double Bay, Thai Oasis at 6 Poplar Street and Kritsana at 263 Oxford Street all offer full nude all inclusive RnT for between $60-70 for 30min. Unbeatable value for the inner city!

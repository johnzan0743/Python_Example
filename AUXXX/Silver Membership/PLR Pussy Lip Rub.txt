PLR - you mean rubbing the head over her wet lips but not actually sliding inside?
If that's the case - lots of girls are ok with it - but how to recommend? Some do, some don't - also depends on the client, some first time some not.
Might have to try a few out - the chinese girls are the most likely though.

To be frank, without asking, I've had so many girls happy to do this, I've lost track.

It's probably a matter of being a regular client and respectful enough to gain a level of confidence and trust.

Without naming them, any Thai shop on the north side has girls who have done this with me and many Chinese ones as well.

Of course, as MooNoi has mentioned, there may be risk involved. But I don't have warts so lets not start another fcuking health thread!

Go see Melissa in Canberra. She'll give your knob a serious rubbing between her gigantic pussy lips. She'll even slip it in bareback if she likes you ðŸ˜‰  Not recommended practice though. But it has happened..........allegedly.

If you're going for that kind of unprotected contact I can't see that there's that much more risk in going the whole way BB. Genital warts and herpes would have to be a significant risk, possibly a range of other maladies as well.

Having said that, I've had quite a few WLs do it for me over the years and a couple of times it's ended in full BB sex. I have little doubt that if a WL likes a guy she can get herself pretty horny rubbing his dick against her clit.

You're dead right there Phil. Same for daty. Same thing with the warts and herpes risk, only its your tongue and mouth collecting those juices.

Absolutely right Phil... proven yet again by yesterday's delightful session with an erotic Thai ML in Sin City's north. Review imminent

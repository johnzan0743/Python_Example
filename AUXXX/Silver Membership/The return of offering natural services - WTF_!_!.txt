 The return of offering natural services - WTF?!?!
				
Post Content: 
Being located in the nation's capital, and an avid (though less frequent due to travel) punter, I've noticed through the various online sites (backpage/cracker predominately) that natural services are being offered more frequently.

As much as Eddie Murphy commenting in Raw/Delirious (I can't remember- the leather suits he wore awe me) of your dick exploding if you go bareback, I can't fathom the risks associated with going cowboy on a WL without a hat. 

What's worse, it looks like people are taking up the offer as it seems that the increase of services offered reflect demand. 

Then again, I recall my youth where I harpooned several young lasses from UC/ADFA/ANU bareback after a night at Mooseheads/Pandoras/ICBM/UC Bar/ANU Refectory (I'm showing my age if you are a Canberran). The argument that it's nothing different is completely wrong. Barebacking a pickup after a night out is manifestly different to poking a WL/ML whose main employment is getting poked by all members of society. True, the risks of picking up something is remote.. unless you're the unlucky SOB who picks up something and inadvertently passes it on to others.

I wonder if the local sexual health clinic has has it's funding increased due to the possible increase in checks when you start pissing out needles after an adventure gone wrong....

Rant over. It's been said repeatedly... no glove, no love when it comes to ML/WL's.

I'm not sure why it's useful to use a poll to highlight another scary message about sexually transmitted infections, a topic which regularly gets a good sounding on this forum in the relevant health threads.

However, "The argument that it's nothing different is completely wrong." may be wrong for reasons different to that suggested by the OP.

Regular students of The Kirby Institute's Annual Surveillance Report HERE will know that statistics show the risk from sex workers is significantly lower than in the general community, especially amongst the young. Note that punters tend to be older than those who engage with pickups down the local. Before making sweeping generalizations, a read of the report is strongly suggested.

That's not to say let's go soft on sex safety. Safe sex is regularly strongly encouraged around this forum but factual generalizations can give false impressions. And let's not enter any arguments (again) about whether this or that sexual practice is risky or not. Be smart and make your own rational decisions.

Co-incidentally, just today I received my clean bill of sexual health from my regular STI checks at the local medical centre. Every punter should be doing the same since even widely recommended condoms are not 100% safe.

No rant... just sayin'

Registered sex workers that require a clean bill of health before service -- totally agree. I'm more worried about the FIFO from SE Asia and other nations that come in undocumented and lay on their back for the duration of their tourist visa to earn relatively big bucks here before they fly home.

The poll was aimed to reflect attitudes in what I perceive happens within the community - and from hearing from experiences where people pay for the extra dollars to go bareback. 

I simply note the fact that the ads I see are advertising with more frequency the offer of natural services. Surely it wouldn't happen if people aren't asking for it.

Then again... it's your dick and yours to play with.

Simply being devil's advocate here... not wishing to argue the toss. However, the forum doesn't encourage posts that can serve to unnecessarily scare-monger about sexual health... especially new members who may be testing the P4P industry for the first time. We've seen many times before that general sweeping statements regarding sexual health can cause anxiety... unnecessarily.

Having just done a pretty comprehensive search of just one listing, backpage escorts, using keyword 'natural', in fact there are very few offers of natural SEX. Plenty of natural ORAL mentions and perhaps oral was included in the OP's observations. However using that one search, an overwhelming number of hits specifically state NO NATURAL SEX. Further, the occasional ones that appeared to offer natural sex didn't all stand further scrutiny. One e.g., repeated on Locanto and using the same pics for a different name, was expired. Another one or two were clearly ads from an agency and almost certainly used NATURAL as a cunning hook... to those foolish enough to go seeking natural services. It may well be that once in the session, natural is denied. We don't know... we don't see that reported. Agencies are well-known to use every trick in the punting ad book to generate business.

We also don't see routine reviews describing natural sex as a feature of sessions. Of course, given reservations expressed sometimes here on AXR, posts may well exclude such intel. So, begs the question how do we know who or how many are playing unsafe? Simply perceptions... or assumptions? Can be very misleading.

Given the level of response to this poll compared with the many who have read it... there doesn't seem to be much interest in declaring one's preferences. For one, I don't see anything achieved. If the poll remains, perhaps it should be moved to the Auxxxreviews Polls forum.

Over the last 6 months or so I’ve been concerned with the number of Cracker ads in Parramatta and Penrith offering bareback services. There might not be many now but I remember one time I was looking there was approximately 10 ads. They could be from a group and only related to a couple of places but there were many ads.
I’d never visit these places and never want BBFS, however I do like BBBJ and have hoped that the guys that visit the BBFS providers don’t go anywhere near the places I visit and just stick to the BBFS providers. I think I’m kidding myself though!

Yes I guess it varies from time to time and depending which listing. There's a huge amount of reading to sift through the lot! Seems BP and cracker run pretty much parallel as they have the same ownership. Along with Locanto, none can really be trusted.

Activity area can vary too. On the north shore where I mainly punt, BBFS is almost never advertised. But of course we know it happens, no doubt with individually trusted providers as mentioned in the poll... or 'wardrobe malfunctions'! 

And yeah... we're kidding ourselves to believe that anyone we see has never been poked raw!!! Hence any concerns about uninformed generalisations vs educated info regarding sexual health.

Cover up and get tested is the mantra

I look at these adverts and think, what a way to get people in and how stupid are the girls advertising this in the first place,, some could be scams, other s real, none the less it s playing roulette with your cock, your life and your partners life and legaly , im sure that has repercusions if you give your parter HIV or HC, so on and so on.

IN MY OPINION DONT DO IT

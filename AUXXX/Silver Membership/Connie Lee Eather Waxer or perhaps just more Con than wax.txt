 Connie Lee Eather Waxer or perhaps just more Con than wax

Hi fellow forum members.

I am unsure the topic has not been canvassed before however perhaps an important one to surface from time to time.

The above worker (not sex worker ) ( well not anymore) has demanded ID Photo and bank statements before agreeing to meet for an appointment.

She advertises on Gumtree. Once contact is made there an appointment time is agreed and then a couple of days before the appointment the demand comes for Photo ID with name and address and further details.
Once something has been surrendered then further demands for proof are unfolded.

Now I have seen this lady a number of years back in Ashfield. Quite attractive but something nagging me to steer clear.
Of course I ignored rule no 1. Listen to the voices. Returned and was rewarded.

So that leads to the current months events. Trying to make an appointment to see her again without disclosing information demanded by her.

 Clearly she is requesting information that should be sacrosanct and closely guarded.

I was wondering if anyone has seen her of late and if so did they surrender their ID to see her or is it the scam of the Century to have someone demand something State it is for security suggest they will destroy the information and actually get past the Pretorian Guard?

Of course I didn't see her in spite of the memory of the last encounter in Ashfield.

She claims to be at Redfern.

How far do you go to visit a punt. That is not in travel but as in complying with demands of the worker to satisfy them for somewhat dubious reasons or reasoning to avail them of detail that likely will come back to bite you?

Should you simply say Nup. not going there. It's BS and coated in Chocolate...looks good but take a bite and eeeeewwwwww!!!!

I think you will open yourself up to Identity fraud and it should take about 5 minutes for her to clean out your bank balance. Look for a new waxer/ML

From time to time Ive seen these type of ads by WLs, they are not common but do pop up from time to time. I always, repeat always, don't give it the time of day once I read they require payment (or part of) up front, plus at times confirmed id or photo. Bank statements take it to another level which id never seen someone request 

Im sure there are legit ladies out there doing this sort of screening and pre payment, but it is not and never will be for me.

These are her details from her Linked-in entry:

"Trade certificate Beauty Culture 25yrs experience in this field. Owner manager Skinsational Nail & Beauty studio Ashfield NSW Well Travelled & lived in USA , Motel management / Mid Nth Coast 10yrs experience. Current Owner - / Abundance beauty "

Looks like a genuine beauty therapist to me.

[MOD EDIT]
Is there any point in fantasising about this lady? Perhaps it would help if you posted a link to her Gumtree ad.

I have all those details already. Simply put I research to an extent of ensuring my personal safety will not be of concern. Apart from that punting is great.

A partial extract from a message conversation between her and my alter ego is as follows for her.

Connie Lee   Hi next day will be fine for 11am 
Brazilian Wax will be between $90 and $110
Massage 1 hr $80 1.5 hrs $110
Kind Regards
Connie-Lee.

Later the next day

Just send me your phone number and I will send you a reminder message the day before.
Regards Connie-Lee (her mob#)


Two days before the appointment  and the following day

Hi prior to treatment I will require a Photo Identification to be sent through to my number below
It's for security reasons only. I will also need to have a quick chat about the treatment you require
Prior to the appointment booked for

Kind regards 
Connie Lee
(Mob#)

Later that day

Hello I will need Photo ID sent through today.

NO ID NO treatment


Kind Regards

Connie Lee

The day before


Hi your drivers license will be sufficient and I will need to speak to you prior to treatment.

After being told I don't have a DL. (I do but not for her)

Hi send me through a bank statement with your details on it or any mail with your details on it and a photo of you please.

AT THIS POINT I REPORTED THE CONVERSATION 

Then she sent this 

Something with your name and address on it & not the particulars of the document.
Call me in the morning.



Now this is her side of the conversation. I tried shutting her down with the requests for the Photo ID hence the desperation in her requests as the clock ran down.

I never gave her any details or even a number.

I did not attend the appointment as she had not given me any details.

Except I already had her address as she had the same conversation a few weeks back with my alter ego...She gave me the address then.


That is what I encountered. 

Pretty sure she would be shocked if she realised she has met me before and shared a lot more than an exchange of ideas.That was some time ago.

She was ran out of Ashfield like a number of others have been bullied out of the area. So not certain if she is plotting or just really paranoid.

Comment if you like.

As always thanks for reading.

SR.

Guys, just to make something clear. Please be mindful of posting personal details of ladies. No links to be posted to personal social media accounts. Links to accounts advertising their business are fine however.

Thanks for that NL.

It made me feel a little uncomfortable with the details given by the previous poster.

I do think that however you slice it the clear demand for ID info cannot ever be underestimated. One thing is for certain once it is out there it cannot be retrieved.

Connie Lee May well be providing a service however the facts are she appears to be gathering a portfolio and you never know perhaps she has a master plan to photograph guys crutches and in her advancing years demand money for removal from a future created Professional Porn Players webpage. With links to your other half...

Just seemed the "trust me" Mantra has the alarm bells ringing and loudspeaker announcing saying run run run Forrest Run!!!!

You refer to your "alter ego".

Does that mean you contacted her using an alternative name?  If you did, it seems you aroused her suspicion, so it is no wonder that she was asking for proof of identity.  She was just wanting to check your bona fides, to make sure you were making a genuine enquiry for a beauty service and were not going to harass her for a sexual service.

I recall the same thing happened with Celeste, whom you initially contacted under one identity, and then made an appointment for a legitimate massage under another.  That sort of devious approach naturally makes a service provider suspicious, regardless of whether she is legitimate or not.

If the lady is providing a legitimate beauty service, she will suspect you of intending to harass her for a sexual service, and will not want to see you, unless you can prove your bona fides.  

If she does provide a sexual service and is only pretending to be a legitimate beauty therapist, she will suspect you of being an agent provocateur working for the local council or the police, and will likewise not want to see you, or if she does see you will refuse to provide a sexual service, as happened with Celeste.

I note that her later message stated that she only wanted some official document with your name and address on it, to prove your bona fides.  She specifically stated that she did not want to see the details contained in it.  That suggests that she is not running some sort of scam as you implied, but simply doubts your good intentions.

You need to really get a grip.

Clearly you have difficulty following the narrative.

The enquiries were made separately and in no way connected.
If you can follow simple logic then you will read the fact that she came back to the conversation which was by any measure not imposing on her in any way.

Because others including yourself may have intentions of hassling someone they certainly are not any part of what makes me tick. I never hassle anyone and indeed take exception to your unsolicited imputations.

I do note this is not the first time you have approached topics which others read as a different set of circumstances.

Now not that it is any of your business the fact was there was a report based upon the message she sent. I have redacted some of the messages she sent me as I was not wanting to crucify her. However going in without half the facts means you are distorting the facts to what end?

Simply put if you need to accuse someone then take a long hard look in the mirror.

If you must read I suggest novels not any of my posts. It is very clear that the warning is out there but unless you are taking a side which is contrary to law then perhaps you might reflect before casting assertions onto my motives.


As for Celeste conflating the two threads is akin to suggesting that Connie Lee is doing a service contrary to her ad. She may be performing in a circus but that has nothing to do with the way she has approached the subject of saying Trust Me. I am unsure she is doing anything aside from accumulating information on potential clients and I suggest that others read what they like into the thread but use your logic before making inane comparisons or commentary.

As for Celeste she is doing full service for some rub n tug for others and straight massage I don't think so. She is hiding from something or someone but I simply write it up as I see it and I am not into playing hide and seek. 
Perhaps she needs the money...do you think?

I don't think you are in any position to comment. Consider yourself told!

A sensible question. No mate I didn't because that would have given her my number. She is about accumulating information. 
I don't really know why she has gone down this track but selling ID's to the organised criminal networks is rather lucrative. She was reported to the Customer service and contacted by them asked for a please explain and she followed that up with a different tune in the next communication with me.

I am astute enough to know when I am being played. She is playing for detail she simply doesn't need. 
And she isn't going to get it either.

 Fact is she waits until 2 days before after making the demand, request, stipulation ...call it what you like.

She has overplayed her hand. As there has been discussion about her before this is merely a thread to alert members to approach with caution. 
This game is played with all who book both outcall and in all services.

I have seen her as stated in the past. Ashfield a number of years ago. She has changed her MO. And so it goes.

But thanks for asking

Yes I agree it has all the hallmarks of a scam.

I don't believe this is a scam (although I of course would never provide identification to Connie-Lee).

The reason I don't believe it's a scam is because although I've never visited Connie-Lee I was able to make a booking without providing ID (which I had to later cancel). When making this booking she did originally ask for ID, but once she understood that I genuinely only wanted a Brazilian wax (which indeed is all I wanted), she went ahead and made the booking without raising the issue of ID again.

From my limited exchanges with her she has told me she gets a lot of guys wanting extras which she certainly does not provide. I think the request for ID is simply to deter anyone wanting extras, i.e., separate the sheep from the goats.

It goes without saying it's better to be safe than sorry, so if Connie-Lee is adamant on you providing your ID in order to make a booking, simply don't visit her (I certainly wouldn't if my ID was required assure my booking).

I hope this information helps - cheers!

It is good to see a post that succinctly provides the essential details about a service and its provider, without deluging us with a torrent of verbose fantasising and idle speculation.

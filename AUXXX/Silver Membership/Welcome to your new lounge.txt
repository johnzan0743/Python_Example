Welcome Silvers,

Here is where you can discuss information that does not strictly fit as a review but is best kept away from public scrutiny.

Gentleman of Silver,

Welcome to your new area..

It is reminded that the forum code of conduct and rules of engagement apply here and throughout the forum..

The purpose of this area is used as a "shelter" for those post deemed more risqu√© and sensitive to be posted in the bronze area which is "open".. And more suitable to "scrutiny".. 

It is your area to use as you see fit but be reminded that although it is a safe haven it is not fully.. 

Welcome and enjoy the lounge..

AB

It is via post count.. And also members can purchase membership with immediate access to silver.. So even though posts of "extras" are shelter from the "greater" bronze membership.. There are other ways to access Silver lounge.. User pays.. Understood?..

Understood perfectly. A private investigator with a Council paying his expenses can buy Silver. As can a Council Goon if the Council has allowed him to bypass the Council's Net Nanny and access "n@ughty" websites (and given him a petty cash allowance).

Post with this in the back of your mind ...

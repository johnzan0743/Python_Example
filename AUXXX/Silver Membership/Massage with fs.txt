Just wondering, does anyone know of any massage shops that have the is option in the south eastern suburbs? Or even eastern. Have tried searching but didn't have any luck with reviews.

418 Station St Box Hill. Don't expect glamours, but all the ladies are very willing to please.

Jesus, you weren't kidding lethal!!!! Popped in and got greeted by the tracksuited man. He immediately asked for cash, I wanted to see the girls first. Out comes yoyo wearing something that left very little to the imagination, which in this case was not a good thing! Pulled out the debit card knowing they don't have a eft machine so said I'd go to bp and get cash. Didn't stop running till I locked the front door!!

My suggestion would be Barabings now known as Number 100. It's primarily a RnT but many of the girls offer FS as an extra.

Edit: sorry - in my haste to reply I missed the south east part ! Recommendation still stands though if you can make it to Fitzroy.

There used to be 2 on Elgar road but they are long gone.. Station st, yes, but as you found out not good lookers.. i haven't ventured up to Ringwood but there is a brothel in blackburn that offers a "relaxation massage" for $70.. i am sure if tyou threw some cash at the girl she'd do anything..

Shame she disappeared without a trace. I now get contact details of ladies worth keeping in contact with.

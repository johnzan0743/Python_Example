It would be great to get a little feedback on this offer.

Let us know what appeals to you so that we can negotiate with our advertisers to make your puntmas and very draining time.

Oh wow, great offer. 
I'd definitely be keen for similar promotions if any of the Northern Beaches / North Shore advertisers wanted to do similar. Unfortunately Paddington is not on any of my normal routes so planning two visits wouldn't be worth it for me.

Yeah, Paddo's not really my stomping ground either. I always get lost in the eastern suburbs.

I must admit that it is also quite difficult for me to travel to Paddington however, having savored the delights of this establishment, it is worthwhile to take a little detour, maybe spend a little more time traveling and finding this little gem.

Same here. If it was Bonz1 at Seven Hills...there's pages of reviews there.

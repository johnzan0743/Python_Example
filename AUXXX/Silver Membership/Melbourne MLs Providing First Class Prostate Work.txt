What about Veronica in Prahran?  I can't speak from experience as I've yet to book with her but she is on the bucket list though.

You know guys, it's been a while but I think you might be right (I checked my original post - elsewhere - and no mention of a finger in the fundament). And now that you mention it, the one thing about Donna is that it is a very tightly controlled event where she is loathe to go "Off script". My apologies to any who rushed off to get some attention from her to their prostate - nevertheless iot was a high quality treatment.

Veronica gives your prostate a work out with her tongue!  Pretty much anything goes with this one.

   Yes, Veronica, by all reports, belongs on this list. Unfortunately, I have to exclude her from my personal shopping list due to too few degrees of separation (just two) from my private life - in which I once met her in a social setting.

How could she get her tongue that far inside your rear end to give the prostate any sort of enjoyment?

Hey guys
I only saw Donna once and then she moved so I couldn't re-visit but she is definitely on for some prostrate stimulation - offered me a vibrator / finger service and went to some effort to ensure these are cleaned /covered etc.

Won't do the Veronica tongue service however - that's just a bridge too far! Funny thing before she moved to Cranbourne she was only a few minutes walk from Ronnie's house of tongue! I had fantasised about a special treat - double service!!
Just as well she moved - it would have cost a fortune!

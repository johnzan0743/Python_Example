The hint that the Italian Lady May be plying her trade in the West well Parra is something of a mystery. A Miracle Mystery that is.

Now Tina advertised in Gumtree may well be the same as pointed out in the thread Intel in PML NSW follow the above link.

Until someone who has seen Frances and knows her from the old days at South Strathfield and wishes to be molested by her and take the chance that they might need therapy afterward actually punts and proves this individual to be one and the same we won't know.

I won't volunteer as I cannot be sure that it is our lady of the Psychic Miracle that may appear to molest oops I mean massage you. 

If is walks like a duck
If it quacks like a duck
If it looks like a duck
Well perhaps it's a chicken?

So Tina may turn out to be alias the Miracle Massage Lady

and perhaps not.

This is in silver as most interested parties have been around and commented upon this lady Jasmine etc
and I think we need to be a little or a lot cautious as she is a Licensed Private Investigator.

As I have suggested this may turn out to be or not to be the lady in question.

If someone wishes to TOFTT just make sure you park your vehicle away from the punt. Don't wear anything that might give away who you are and be aware the massage is not great but the tug is included along with the molestation. Especially if she takes a fancy to you. If it's Frances.

Gumtree ads are linked so she is not exactly the sharpest knife in the block.

Best of luck

I might be wrong about this but Tina does not sound like Jasmine on the phone...and she answered first time I rang which is unlike the previous Jasmine...so take from that what you will.

Thanks Milfy.

I wasn’t sure but the fact remains that this lady likely has a Private Investigators license and the warning when visiting someone with these credentials always applies.

I will likely confirm someday soonish if I manage to get an appointment. Be assured a full report and review will be forthcoming or even fifth. 

In other news

I have been massaged by Policewomen before. You just had to be there. You always park a distance away from the venue. I walk the long way back to my wheels.

This one has all the behaviours of Frances. If you are aware of who Frances is then try and hook up with this lass. Or should I say old boiler. 

All the signs of behaviours evasive and others displayed by Jasmine and the its a bloody miracle if you get to see her So called Miracle Massage Lady.

Perhaps someone wants to waste time with this one. Not this fella though.

Life is way too short to consider seeing this crazy one.

Pazz, you are taking this thread off topic.Disrespectful to the OP, Sleazyryder.  If you want to know about Gilfs massaging, then please start a new thread.

Tried contacting again to see if she is doing massages. Got no reply and her gumtree ad is down, so she could be out of business.

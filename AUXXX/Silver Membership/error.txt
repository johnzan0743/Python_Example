Catherine has moved on. 
This place is a now apparently an Asian massage parlour. Current status of services provided unknown ATM.
Catherine's old number is 9144 4251 - she had relocated to around Balgowlah and was hoping to relocate to Chatswood in the new year. Not sure of her current status.
Hope this helps.

So as a long term punter (30yrs+) you get to experience a whole range of interesting adventures, but still there are a couple eluding me, so they are on my bucket list for punting action. This thread isn't meant for bragging, just interested in seeing what experiences people may have on their 'fucket list'. 

Number 1 - Twins, still hunting this elusive experience

Number 2  - Join the Mile High Club

Nice thread Khadji. Have one up on you. Have been in the mile high club. Had a blowjob from a girl I was travelling with, whilst we were sitting in our seats, during the night, in business class. And I blew in her mouth and she swallowed.

Other than that, would like a threesome with a ladyboy and a girl. Where we all fuck each other. Despite being a frequent visitor to Pattaya, am yet to find a ladyboy who will fuck a girl.

I'd love a double with two sisters. Years ago I was fortunate enough to hook up with a girl from work who also had a thing for girls, at a party she kept saying I should fuck her sister and that she would love to watch that. At one stage the sister and I were engaged in some DFK and the girl from work just joined in, we had three tongues wagging and it was hot as. Alas the sister did not want to fuck with her own sister in the room which if it had happen would have gone further, so I've always wondered what it would have been like.

Recently I saw a ML in Castle Hill and uring the massage I remarked about how good her massage was and had she had formal training. She said she had learnt with her sister. My ears sprung up and and I asked does her sister do massage as well, yes in Thailand was her reply. I told her if her sister ever comes to Australia then let me know so that I can hook up with her for a private double massage. On the flip she was up for DATY and as she was quite into it I asked if FS was on the menu, she said next time and I said OK. 

Forever waiting but the two hot sisters has me keen.

I've only been punting 3 yrs. I never really had a list but I knew there were some things I would like and decided to make a list after I crossed one off recently, it made me finally organize my list. Most of my sexual fun has been punting as I have not really had that much of a wild past. Until 3 years ago I only slept with 1 girl once, and then just the wife for 30 years which was all vanilla while it lasted until the dead bedroom for the last 15. This list probably looks tame to some of you.

Costumes at the start that come off: Long QiPao/Cheongsam*, Sheer dress (backlit - hnnnng), Nurse, Flight Attendant, JK, OL

While she is wearing: Short QiPao* , Tights/Nylons (that I rip), Choker, Collar, Collar/Leash, Rope cuffs that I tie, Rope restraints

Things to do: both covered in oil*, bj in office, under desk; prolonged bj, cim; wake up to bj; shag a decent JAV star; find someone to practice tantra with; Sat in a plain chair with no armrest, her facing.

I'm sure there are more, enjoyed this thread so far.

I thought I had several FS doubles recently with Chinese sisters in a massage shop. 
I wondered if they actually were sister .. the similarities were few.

After asking one of them after our third doubles session. I went to the translator and she confirmed that they were friends for a village and as close as sisters. 

Sisters is a common reference to close friends in some Asian cultures, so make sure you confirm if they really are sisters ,  or just ‘sisters’. Haha ..

Another Thai pair  who also refer to themselves as ‘sisters’ .. are similar... but quite different.. but I think of them as Siamese Twins when they smother me in unison with their DD’s..

Good luck finding the allusive sisters.

Not a punt list - but CIP, CIM, ankd CIGreek all in one night. Need to get in better shape for this one.

I've had 3 girls for 30 minutes at 181, but it was all CBJ (never used that many condoms in 30 mins), wanna try a 3~4some again with some BBBJ and DFK.

Reminds me of the mother/daughter pornstars Ryan Conner and her daughter Dylan Phoenix. Ryan travels the world escorting or used to. Sadly, Dylan has retired from porn (and I assume does not escort). But that would be a combo I'd be very interested in spending a silly amount of money on.

I know a number of PML's mostly caucs but a few lovely Thai girls and the odd MLC who have been into bodybuilding but that was last decade and even last millennium. 
The side effects of bodybuilding are obvious.  The peck muscles are the thing that disappoints as you really want to use your imagination however when the bra comes off you need to close your eyes as looking into dried up prunes on a well developed peck is depending upon your viewpoint kinda off putting for some.

One ml from the early nordies in Sydney's Lower North Shore who was a champion bodybuilder who used to get naked and upon the flip dom you up and ride you like there was no tomorrow. Ahh memories without mammories.
Sorry I digress.

There are many lovely Thai gals in various shops in most Eastern seaboard Metros who might well fit the bill.

Some who have nuanced jugs. Some who have undergone the knife due to bodybuilding ruining their muscle tone and figures.
The topic brings many tastes into play. Personally I rarely type a ML into a category save for ones to revisit and ones to avoid.

As for looking for a well toned ML I am just happy if they know WTF they are doing when massaging. Hence the real term of having a punt.

Perhaps you are looking for lasses that are fit enough for you to chase around the table but not that fit that they actually catch you or indeed lap you.

If you want a name try Sarah Edwards. She certainly fits the bill. She is a lifesaver an Emergency massage specialist she doesn't mind getting naked. Well toned super fit and highly sexed. Enjoys fucking like there is no tomorrow. Will shatter your back if not careful but does a reasonable fix once she has fucked your back . Literally. 

She is in Surfers P SEQ.

Thanks Wach. I made the enquiry but not being in Vic atm thought one of the boys might check it out.

A bit of a windup but will try and get a pic of the real thing. Gym background checks out so I thought it might be a windup but with the off chance but...

I let it go as I was more interested in the bird in the hand as opposed to the one in the bush. However she has a checkered past. Put it this way she made it to the newspapers for being out there.

 If anyone wants to risk it happy to supply further details. She has a great rack but is on the mature side but does an excellent remedial massage. She is rather slim darker skinned olive rather than dark pigmented.
She works out of a motel come cheap stay accompanied where she lives.

Same place I posted the number for.

Over a cpl summers of coastal trips,  found this to be reliable both for an ok/good ‘massage and ok/good. hj.

Usually by a ‘fuller figured’  late 40’s plus Chinese woman. For those Spanish  lovers , DD’s though I’ve never thought to ask. 

Occasionally other staff , are rotated there. All  late 40’s plus . Once quite an attractive Chinese woman dressed very well though clearly new. I was told this during the session. Ended in her been in the room also for some schooling. I got impromptu though average 4 -hands . She got a lot of giggles and guidance 

Only once an early 30’s woman. Again Chinese. average massage . Was Offered FS by her and urged to DATY. I declined. 

YMMV Otherwise all clothed or semi clothed  $30/50 hj

Coffeectound the corner on Beach RD. Really good

The massage place at Batehaven shops is good. Was there Before Xmas 2017. I have a review here somewhere about it.
It was a year ago..so...but from memory the HJ was pretty good.
There were one or 2 full service girls but from memory at the time they were on holidays. Nothing on AMM and not much on Seeking form memory or Locanto.
Thought I would add my 2 cents as I was a regular down to Narooma for over 10 years once or twice a year so know the scene quite well....not that there is once

 Website for escorts with punter information / warnings / comments
				
Post Content: 
Hi all

I just went to book with someone to be told my number has come up in a "search" which says I have stolen money of an escort.... 

I've never stolen anything in my life let alone from a escort. The person who stated it said all reports were anonymous and didn't tell me where they saw this rubbish. Googling my own number brings up nothing and I've tried to see if there is any website that would hold such information but no luck.... 

Has anyone had a similar experience? Or know where such rubbish gets posted?

If you use a phone number just for punting then theres really no need to worry. Just change number.

If you use your primary, everyday phone for punting also then you are asking for trouble. 

Whilst I doubt (but its not impossible)  there is a an exclusive website for escorts to check on "dodgy" punters, if you are using your primary number then she has most probably looked you up and decided she doesn't want to see you. 
Whilst you have googled your own number, try searching Facebook by the same number. 

There are Twitter accounts called "Shit Punters" etc where WL's post SMS messages (mainly) and tweets of punters who lack "tact" to put it politely.

I believe there is an online 'punter blacklist' of sorts where WLs record names/numbers of undesirable clients, whether for safety or financial reasons. Can't recall what it's called though, it was discussed on another forum some years ago.

Well, we write anonymous reviews on them so why shouldn't WLs share intel amongst themselves.

In fact they have a better reason for doing so - we use reviews to find good service, they share the info to protect each other.

But there should be some way of correcting the situation if an individual is erroneously blacklisted - but it wouldn't be easy.

I'd like to think something like the "Report an Ugly Mug" forum would increase the level of respect shown to WLs by deterring the punters who treat them badly but I fear such a forum will have no affect on the idiots who don't do the right thing.

The problem with this list is if they accuse a punter for being an ugly mug because they show up late, or some other menial thing. It works both ways. I have heard plenty of stories of escorts taking money for bookings, then not answering calls, showing up late, or not showing at all. I don't book escorts for this reason. One time I had a booking with an amateur escort and when I got there she wouldn't answer her phone. Seen her once before and it was great. She did apologise later saying she was sick. Ok why not text me before? The only problem for me was the time wasted driving there and back. Two hours!

There was a link to a website posted on here earlier this year that sounds like its the one mentioned by LV....I think was posted by a pissed off WL. We removed it as it contained a lot of personal info of punters who had been added to the site. Real names, aliases, addresses, marital status, multiple phone numbers etc....

It wasnt reviews of punters performances as such - it was posted warning WL's of possible dangers associated with booking these individuals.

All sorts of  stuff was included like if they were violent, unclean, fetishes, non payers, thieves  etc....

There are numerous ways to report and view Ugly Mugs, and a few different screening methods. No good sex worker will tell you this information and, frankly, I would be wary of one if they did. 

You know how you guys are always saying to NEVER talk about the forum to workers? It's exactly the same but with the increased risk of rape and violence. I 100% agree that it works both ways, and that is why I (unlike most girls in the industry!) think that review sites are very important. But you do have to understand that, while there is the potential you guys will get assaulted (by her boyfriend or something I guess), sex workers are getting assaulted every single day. And I've read your reviews - I know you can get ripped off too. So please don't be offended or outraged that we talk, as you do. It is so that we can continue working and providing the best possible service. I took two years away from the industry because I was raped by a client. It is in my and your best interest for me to screen. 

The reports are not black and white - it's not 'this guy stole money' and then no one ever sees him again. Just like punter's review sites there are different opinions. Often someone will come along and say 'wow I've been seeing him for years and had no issues', or multiple workers will say they had the exact same experience. So just like this forum the girls can use that information to make the decision on whether they are comfortable seeing that person. Often they will still see the person but be on guard given the information they have received. 

Of course, like punters, there are workers who are bad apples. IF OP genuinely hasn't ever stolen something I can only imagine a worker was angry at him for some reason, wanted revenge, or was just a nutter. And that is a real shame - but it works similar to these forums - we know the workers who can't really be trusted or who get upset at the tiniest little thing and we take what they say with a grain of salt. The other option is she didn't want to see you for some other reason and used that as an excuse?

'Ugly mugs' is just the general term used to describe dangerous punters.

Many moons ago in the early 2000s a wl in an establishment insisted I go get myself checked out by a doctor even though no other wl in other establishments had any issues with their health check. 

So cut a long story short being young and dumb I went to the trouble of going to a sex clinic for tests. But to get a written statement that I actually had clean results I had to tell the clinic staff I was going to start as a male sex worker. 

I was given a booklet to help newbie sex workers. There was a list of ugly mugs in there. Although I assume these days it has moved to electronic format for easy search and comments. 

On a side note the other interesting thing I discovered in this handout was that when a wl suggests a position change the general use that as an excuse to check your Condom is still on and hasn't broken. 

Now when a wl suggests a position change and I see them looking at the condom as a joke I ask them has it broken yet?

 Punters who agree to ridiculous rates of WLs / MLs
				
Post Content: 
Lately I've been trying to book some independant MLs and none of them wanted to negotiate their ridiculous hourly rates. Some of them (on Locanto) charge as high as 250 per hour and this is just for a massage and excluding extras. Extras are even more ridiculous such as $50-100 just to touch them, another $50 to get them topless, wtf? 

I've been trying to negotiate with these workers as they are hot asf but had no luck, they are non-negotiable on the rates and firm on their extras prices because there are dumb people who agree to their ridiculous rates! 

Don't know if it is like this everywhere else but in Melbourne punting not working out for me lately. Who else feels the same?

If you don't like what they are charging, you don't have to go, it's a free country. And yourself a Silver member in this forum already so you should have plenty of intels in regards to RnT scenes in your local area. So rather than angry about it, spend your money else where mate.

TP64 have mirrors on the ceiling.
They are not in best location on the ceiling, but you only need to move down on the Bed a little bit to get great views. 
Lying across the bed is also great. 
At times I wish that I had 3 sets of eyes.
1. To look at the Lady,
2. To look in the ceiling mirror.
3. To look in the large wall mirror.

 Enjoy. !!

Sheilal is correct about the ceiling mirrors at 64TP but I will add that in at least one of the old rooms at the back of the shop, the overhead mirror is perfectly placed.

Perhaps you could request a room back there.

Also, I've only been to Asians at Smithfield once so far but the room I was in had a great overhead mirror, perfectly placed.

 What to include/exclude in your XXX Review Reports
				
Post Content: 
Mods, I am wondering if this topic is worth giving some oxygen to?

When I post a review, I almost always make it accurate and complete in every way. But in a few cases I have stopped short of giving a full report. Examples include, where out of the blue a well known ML has given me full service after a massage and I am virtually certain this is a unique occasion (i.e. I have read dozens of reviews on her and none of them hint at her even taking her top off). So I thought I should keep it quiet because, among other things, it would enable her to know it was me who spilt the beans.....and it would blow my anonymity on this site.

The other occasion is when I visit a very popular massage place and one of the young ML's offers me a bbbj, or full service, or maybe slips me her phone number and says she will come to my hotel. I know that if her Mamasan hears about any of these things, it will result in her instant dismissal.....so I tone the report down a bit by maybe giving her an honest report on massage and HE....and then maybe say something along the lines that more might be available.

Will leave it to you if you wish to open this up or close it down....DB

Good post David Banks. This topic usually comes up after a dickhead shows a review to a  lady. First and foremost you must protect yourself from identification by the lady. If she sees a review and works out its you, it will get very messy, very quickly. Nobody wins when this happens and it invariably turns nasty. Remember she most probably has your phone number....

You are not obliged to put the actual date of your visit in a review, eg November 2017 is fine. This cuts down the odds of detection considerably. You can also leave out or 'water down' services which you think may be unique to you,also references to your nationality could also be a giveaway. Think of all the things that could give you away and leave them out. You can also let it be known that you will field questions via PM if anyone wants to know more. Then its up to you how much, and to whom you wish to disclose more details.

Having said that we still want reviews to be of value to our members so we need a reasonable account of what happened in a review.

You are doing the correct thing in your second point. We have to protect ourselves and we must protect the ladies as much as we can too...I dont think theres much more you can do. 

But the best solution is to keep posting reviews and aim for Gold level membership.....

What you may find is you're not the only guy getting FS, BBBJ and her phone number. I don't know why some guys think they are so special it only happens to them? I would probably stop at mentioning BB services . I do remember one place where I thought I was the only one getting special treatment, then found out it was pretty much standard. Post what you're comfortable with and don't give too many clues about yourself like braunic seems to do. He has been caught out a few times. I try to see different girls.

I agree.     Just tell it as it happens, that's what I do.      If you think it is really special and you want it to be a secret, don't submit a review.      

I also like to know which days the lady works, others may like to sample (or avoid) her services.    Surely this is why we are submitting reviews!     If you forget to ask, post the day of the week of the visit.

In addition to all the good advice above, a review should not embellish the nature of the services provided, especially applicable to MLs. That just raises false hopes amongst some readers and places unreasonable expectations on the lady to replicate extras she may never have actually provided previously.

Doing well, David Banks 

Notwithstanding the requirement to 'tell it like it is' for continued forum value, as Nextlife has pointed out there needs to be a level of protection for both punter and ML in certain circumstances. In particular because some described activity occurs in a massage parlour and is therefore operating outside approved regulation or else services MAY be personally exclusive...... perhaps 

The additional level of protection on this forum is the ability to climb the ladder according to an individual's contribution. For those availing themselves of additional services that they may wish to keep somewhat exclusive to trusted members, the suggestion is to keep reviewing in the spirit of the forum according to experiences and status level and at some point your prowess will be acknowledged with the keys to higher privilege.

Those 'on the take' - who read everything at any given level but who contribute little - are eventually dealt with accordingly.

 The payforplay QLD tour/adventure by SAGACIOUS
				
Post Content: 
As I am sure most of my fellow new south Welshmen partake in reading pay for play's great sexcapades in the land of the cane toad... I've decided I'm going to take a tour for a week of the Sunshine state (dream-world excluded) and visit as many of pay's top recommendations and report back through the eyes of a southerner. I hope the mods don't mind me starting this Lil separate tour thread in here for QLD but I thought it would be useful as I'll be travelling north to south and will plan things out for anyone thinking of following the footsteps of the great pay. 

Pay if you're reading this feel free to drop in a list of your current top picks between the Gold Coast and Bundaberg. I'll be trawling your posts as well. 

Wish me luck and if you don't hear from me in a couple of weeks send a search party!

We cant really start a thread specifically for your adventure where you will review different types of providers in the one thread. It has the potential to open up reviews to members , due to their membership level, who should not able to access them, and there is also the problem of prying eyes etc. It also goes against our system of keeping all reviews of a person/establishment in the one thread.
I have moved this thread to the Silver Lounge , where you can give commentary about your adventures if you like, and post the links to any reviews which you post (in the appropriate Forums).
Hope this works for you...but open to suggestions if you have a better idea.

Ok when you look at Lexi - Bundaberg, she works here & there, same with Leah - Hervey Bay, Sarah Maryborough & any number of other girls , it can be a lottery as to when they work. best I can do is, let me know when your up here & i can then see if these girls are working & available. Alot of the girls only see select clients, they only advertise for the off chance the clients they normally see are not available. Will put a list together mate.

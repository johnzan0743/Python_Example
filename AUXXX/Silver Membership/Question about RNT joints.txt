 Question about RNT joints
				
Post Content: 
Hi guys,

Long time member and for those of you who read my posts, i am mainly a RNT kinda guy who occasionally ventures out to FS every now and then.

Just a quick question for you fellow RNT'ers. Some of you guys visit Asian based ones where there is a massage, a flip then a "tip" for the HJ, with the most common being $20 HJ and $50 for naked HJ. 

Now i enjoy a nice relaxing massage and a lot of times i go for the $20 tip option. This is a combination of my financial situation and also i just enjoy a nice relaxing massage and the HJ is just a nice way to end it for me. That's not to say i dont sometimes spend the extra, it's just my average punt is a massage with a clothed HJ.

Back to the point, i have read a lot of threads on places i go to and noticed a lot of my fellow punters go for the $50 option. I regularly go to a few places and regularly only go for the $20 option. My question is, do most massage ladies prefer their customers to go the $50 route to get more tips? Or do you think that while they get less tips, they don;t mind the $20 option as that is less work for them to strip each time then reset for the next guy? It probably won't change my habits, i am just curious to see what the thoughts are.

Cheers guys
LST

I am sure it depends on the provider, but in general they are doing it for the $ and if they offer the $50 option would be looking to make the extra $ for the same time commitment in the room.

The disrobing/dressing occurs on the punter’s dime, so the extra $30 (or even $20, as a clothed HJ these days often seems to be $30) is relatively easy money for them in my view. The more experienced MLs often have easy to remove attire to expedite this process. Also, if a ML really isn’t keen on the punter or just not in the mood to strip, she may not offer the NHJ option at all (albeit rare if the shop is known for it).

Most RnT massage ladies would definitely prefer the $50+ options for more cash tips, after all, they are there for the money.

If you just want to enjoy the massage plus a clothed HJ to relax and set yourself a budget , then it's best not to book those younger and hot MLs as their expectations in tips are always higher . Try go for Milf or even the mamasan if they are working and they will be lesser upset if you only want the $20 handy, why ? Because they get the full cut of your massage fees plus $20 which is not that bad. The mls only get less than half of the fees after the house cut so tips are important to their incomes.

Just my two cents

Cheers

Ps. Milfs and mamasan usually do a better massage and gives more skillful hj anyway.

Naturally the ladies prefer to earn $50 rather than $20, as this money is all theirs - none taken by 'the house' (unlike the initial massage fee which can be a 50/50 split). Not all ladies offer the full disrobe, for various reasons. Some will just strip, others will make this a more sensual body slide, others still will not only let your hands roam but use the $50 as a dither upset to FS.

I'm with you, though - I really love a good massage and a good happy ending. Sometimes that's enough, sometimes I go for the $50 treatment. Variety and choice are good things!!

Yeah, a good firm remedial massage followed by a sensual HJ (clothed would be fine as it lower my weekly spent !) would be a very good lifestyle for my book. Unfortunately many of my top MLs are not really in that level and I feel bad if I don't at least tip them the $50 - but then again, most of them are so hot and busty and it would very hard (harder than my own dick.........lol) Not to pay for the nude and play with their big boobs !! So if I really want to save money I would go see Nicole at QVB or Yuki at Elizabeth as both can do the kind of firm part 1 that I need and don't really mind just taking the $20 for a long handy...............haha

The above link will direct those who have little cash but are wanting a decent massage along with a nude handjob or more depending upon the choice of China Girls...well they were once upon a time... Girls oh and Chinese...now alll dinky die Aussies.

You can get a handy for $20 or a 30 minute massage for $30 including handy. And for $50 you can get a fuck from an older Asian Granny. Angela but best be first cab off the rank as no showers for the girls. Or clients for that matter.

Been quite some time but these guys are an institution in Sydney for cheap as chips. Open 10am till 6.30pm last chance wank.

Sorry about the open sore Brauninc.

Was thinking for those who have financial challenges perhaps there could be a symbol attached to some threads or even to individual posts with a $ rating system

I.e. Rubadub AMP does a great level of basic servicing for a cheap price $ starting around a lobster to a pineapple. 

That is a cheap price and then perhaps another symbol for quality of service Q./ 

and then another symbol for the distance a Victorian would need to travel to experience this level of absolute value for kilometres travelled to get to a decent affordable punt.

 FMDItsalongway2sydknee!

Or even sure thing. 

As an individual who enjoys a good laugh I also appreciate the other side of the coin. Our Rural counterparts have less choice and sometimes less money to spend.

Perhaps we could take up a collection for Pissed off Punter of the month....Victorians would of course have a head start..

The reason i asked is i usually go to the MILF type places if i am after a nice massage with a happy ending. I do find that if i am greeted with a younger girl that they usually will try to upsell and that got me thinking because i do like my regular places but i dont want to waste people's time if they want to upsell me when all i want is a handy.

But thats not to say i dont sometimes fork out, but i like to do so when i want to and not when i feel forced into it.

Cheers guys for the different feedback and thoughts!

Plus, and this is something which too few punters (and almost none of the younger ones) understand - MILFs and just older Asian woman (>30) in general can do fantastic extras. They usually have more experience than the younger women, their bodies are often still quite good and many times (IMHO) they enjoy your reciprocal attention to their bodies as they are often not getting much or any action at home.

Agreed. Generally when i go for a massage i like the older generation who do a great massage and the happy ending is just a nice way to finish. When i am feeling horny i usually will visit a FS joint or pay the extra. At this stage in my punting life i know what i want and with the intel i get here i can generally go to where i need to go depending on what i am feeling at the time.

Original post was just something i wanted to ask but i kinda already knew the answer. Thanks for the feedback boys!

I don't do FS joints these days but I totally get where you are coming from. I find the younger ladies are usually not much chop with the massage and treat the session more as a tug or much more with a rub to start, while older more experienced massage ladies treat the entire session as one experience - a good (sometimes really good, really relaxing) massage and the happy ending is an integral part of that - it's a bit more of the Asian 'total relaxation for the man' approach. Of course there are often assorted extras on offer but one can choose those as suits the mood, the lady and the budget.

A lot of time spent in classic Asian spas in the city and Chatswood (eg many incarnations of 7 Help) plus a fair bit of time in Asia really helped me appreciate this more holistic approach to the relaxation session. 7 Help in its best days went full on, amazing Korean lovelies doing FS, but it will still wrapped into the whole "men's relaxation" idea. Expensive compared to straight rub-and-tug but a real experience and one you could enjoy for hours.

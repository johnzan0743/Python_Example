 Punters who agree to ridiculous rates of WLs / MLs
				
Post Content: 
Lately I've been trying to book some independant MLs and none of them wanted to negotiate their ridiculous hourly rates. Some of them (on Locanto) charge as high as 250 per hour and this is just for a massage and excluding extras. Extras are even more ridiculous such as $50-100 just to touch them, another $50 to get them topless, wtf? 

I've been trying to negotiate with these workers as they are hot asf but had no luck, they are non-negotiable on the rates and firm on their extras prices because there are dumb people who agree to their ridiculous rates! 

Don't know if it is like this everywhere else but in Melbourne punting not working out for me lately. Who else feels the same?

Oh i do Sribrah, i do on, a great many things.    As the late great Foreman used to say, just stick to the brothels.  They will sort out all of the pricing issue's re- Privates/rnt's.

If you don't like what they are charging, you don't have to go, it's a free country. And yourself a Silver member in this forum already so you should have plenty of intels in regards to RnT scenes in your local area. So rather than angry about it, spend your money else where mate.

Cheers

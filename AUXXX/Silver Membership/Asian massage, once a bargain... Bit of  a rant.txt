 Asian massage, once a bargain... Bit of  a rant
				
Post Content: 
Over the years I have had my share of massages, here is the timeline...

Originally I was introduced to the kings court massage where you could chat with the girl, the decide if you wanted a rub with her. Taking usually an hour for a 30 minute massage. All in their 20's

Then I progressed to the kings court "roman nude spa" treatment... Exciting in itself, usually seeing potentially a few other girls with their tits out in a big spa with you...  Even a foot rub from the girl opposite you could happen.

I then moved to Nirvana, where you went knocking on doors room by room... I great idea as a 30 min massage became 1 hr experience ..   This usually cost around $120.  I also loved the excitement of knocking on the doors, a chat and then picking one.

***** now At this point in my punting at nirvana -   a $120 massage was a very pretty Caucasian doing a body to body massage - that means  rubbing her tits all over you, tackle tickle and usually reverse body slide, followed by a handy while your groping her...   All in a private room and a 5 star shower and towels.

Now this is where I felt.... I was getting ripped off - as I started to find nice young Chinese dolls doing the same thing for $80. Wow, what a bargain.....

But slowly over the last couple of years,  the excuses and tricks used  at the Asian shops have now made me stop punting with them....  The procedure at about 9 of my last 10 punts has been....

1.   $35 massage and $50 for nude....   However "nude" seems to mean nude in the last 5/10 mins. The first 20 mins was wasted with oil, very little tackle tickle and a wish washy massage...
2.  Body to body...  This is Lost in Translation...     This in Asian speak means "you will touch each other probably"
3.  Bait and switch...   Young girl answering the door or phone, but out pops mother or grandma with a Big c scar to rub you down.  Or the young girl does the massage and mamasan comes in to rub one out later.

4.  The old excuse of leaving their pants on as they have their period...

So I have had enough... I tried to do the math, but it's really hard to be black and white...

Calculations:
12 Bellevue (at least you know what your getting) - $65. -   Bargain (if that's what your shopping for)

Asian massage - $85 to $90.  30 mins, without a shower, heaps of oil, curtains separating you from the next bloke, a funny smell In the room, crap massage, darkness hiding 20 years and a c-scar.

Nirvana equivalent... $160.    5 star accommodation, usually a early 20s girl with model type body.

Now is this price justified ?...   Well,   I definately would say 2 crap Asian punts are worth 1 good nirvana punt.  So yes, on the back of my last crap 8 Asian punts, yes, it's back to nirvana..

Any views on this ?

Hi brother Stealth,


That's a pretty good argument there, I personally was an old time At Michelles customer back in the 29 Newland Street good old days, so I'll say I share some of your sentiments.

However, the examples you listed above for an Asian RnT shop (excluding all those Korean B2B shops as they are very similar to your Niranva in terms of price range and services and facilities!) were pretty much on the lower end of the extreme cases and I think for any well informed punters in this or other forums, they will know better.

So let's see what can we agree on and what are the things we disagree:

I agree:





			
				1. $35 massage and $50 for nude.... However "nude" seems to mean nude in the last 5/10 mins. The first 20 mins was wasted with oil, very little tackle tickle and a wish washy massage...
2. Body to body... This is Lost in Translation... This in Asian speak means "you will touch each other probably"
3. Bait and switch... Young girl answering the door or phone, but out pops mother or grandma with a Big c scar to rub you down. Or the young girl does the massage and mamasan comes in to rub one out later.

4. The old excuse of leaving their pants on as they have their period...
			
		

Haha, that's pretty much all of your points................lol

But what I disagree with you is that, most of the RnT shops that I know or I have been visiting, can do a lot better.

Yes, the price is $35/$40 for the basic 30 min massage plus $20 for a clothed HJ or $50 for a nude HJ, and yes, some MLs may try to keep the panties on even if they are not having the M or they tried to fake the M by putting the pads on anyway. But a great majority of the MLs that I know will get totally naked for your $50 big ones.

And yes, most MLs will not get naked until the turn over, so you are only getting the 10-15 min of the nude, but if you tip unfront and ask for it, most MLs will get naked for you from the start.

So it is a matter of $160/30 min at the Nirvana vs. $85/$90 at most RnT shop. Well, I can say which is better, the $70/$75 price difference is quite significant, it's basically 1 punt vs 2 punts.

And for the 1 hour session, it is $240 at the Nirvana vs $55+$50 or $60+50 at most RnT so again, it's double the prices.

Each to their own as what is value for money for you. 

But I have one last BIG point to make here: There is only ONE Nirvana at Cleveland street !! vs. there are 10's and 100's of RnT shops everywhere.

Next to your work, next to your home (or near enough !) , it is the convenient as well.

If you work in the city, you just want a quickie, you can pay $35 for a 30 min massage + only $20 for a HJ, and you can do it 3 times for the price of one x 30 min at Nirvana............... It's too easy for the RnT mate.

And I haven't even touched on how good some of the RnT shops and RnT girls are................haha

Just my two cents

Cheers

If someone was to open an oriana again now that would liven up the scene. From memory it was $160 for a fantastic full body wash down and massage, spa and sauna then a great 30 min massage from a usually very hit Korean with extras nearly always available. That was the benchmark until the councillor fucked it up. Oh happy days. Kara where are you now??

I liked your response brother Lungor, 

Yes, you point out correctly that the price for 2 Asian massages is the same as 1 from Nirvana.  I agree with your sentiments, but my thoughts are tipping back to Nirvana as better value still (in my humble opinion).  As I look back at my last 8 Asian punts and have the feeling of being "taken" each time (unfortunately), compared to my Nirvana visits, of being a great session with a gorgeous girl.  I guess I also compare the following points...

Asian shops - when leaving after a BAD punt. 
1.  Wallet is lighter $85. 
2.  Oil still on my body and on my shirt, undies, socks, feeling like I have travelled 200km in a truck without aircon.
3.  The mental picture of an Asian WL with c scar and saggy boobs, hairy bush  giving me a handy.

Nirvana (or equivalent) - when leaving after a bad punt.
1.  Wallet lighter $160ish
2.  Had a nice shower and got to perve on the girl while in huge shower. 
3.   Girl was mid 20s and Caucasian
4.  I felt a 20yr old girls tits and viewed her bush while she pulled me off.
5.  Viewed her naked all session.

Just my thoughts.....  To be continued. After a refresh at nirvana.

Another pretty strong arguments there brother Stealth, and again, I have to agree with everything you say, but this time, I will offer some alternatives:

I think I did once or twice have experienced exactly what you have described above and it wasn't pleasant, however, I am very proud to say that on average 9/10 of my Rnt punts in the past few years were very good to exceptional, here is why:

1. RnT shops I have been to in the past three years: 501 Newtown, 532 Newtown, 447 King Street, 329b King Street, 288 Wattle St, 5 Ways Rockdale, 2/741 George St (Snow Lotus), 9/741 George St, 107 Quay St, 248 Kent St (7 Lotus), 1B/139 York St (QVB), 376 Pitt St (Silver Fox), 316 Elizabeth St, 252B Parramatta Rd Stanmore, Mimi at Stanmore, 7 Lotus, QVB, Burwood and Crows Nest................plus a few adhoc one here and there, they are all pretty good, most of the times, I knew which ML I am going to see and make an advance booking, and 90% of the times it was satisfactory or at least above average.

2. You mentioned about no shower, OK a lot of the above shops don't have a shower, but these shops do: Stanmore, Silver Fox, 316 Central, 329B King St, Rockdale, and Mimi at Crows Nest (this lady's name keep coming up as she uses the most oil, but she is in the 35-40 age bracket so probably not your cup of tea, but gee, you don't know what you are missing brother, you talk about B2b at Nirvana, you don't really know how good a B2B can be until you tried Mimi's.................like on the verge of cuming but she just won't let you, up to the edge and back - a few times, for the whole 30 min, 45 min or 60 min, one brother recently posted to say Mimi had him on the edge for the full 90 min ! and after he finally cum like crazy, he can't walk................lol)

3. 



			
				The mental picture of an Asian WL with c scar and saggy boobs, hairy bush  giving me a handy.
			
		

Well, I must say this sort of body type do exist and in some of the above mentioned shops too, but there are so many 20-25 girls working in the industry now, and they are top of the rank stuff mate, you try some of them, you will never have that same mental picture ever again !!

Let me give you my top 5 young MLs:

Cici at Stanmore
Sue at QVB
Olivia at Silver Fox
Rebecca at 316 Central
Sherry at 316 Central

BTW, so that you know, both Linda at Silver Fox and Alice from 316 Central only hire MLs under 30's - may be you ought to give them a try.

So until you give my suggestions a test, we will still have some points that we don't agree on...................haha

Cheers

ps. Silver Fox has a fixed price for B2b special massage: $80/30 min, $100/45 min and $120/60 min, comparison is most welcome.

And 316 Central is just around the corner from Nirvana !!

An interesting thread.  I've been inclined to stick to the pricier Aus/Euro shops like BODYROTIC and Misty's because my perception has been that the quality of service and ML is generally better and more consistent than most Asian ones, and am less likely to leave with a sour taste in my mouth as described by Stealth.  I'd prefer one good session to two poor ones every time.  The proliferation of Asian parlours has also been bewildering so that it's hard to know which ones will deliver the goods and which ones to steer clear of.

However, Lungor has thrown down the gauntlet with his 'hit list' and I'll have to try a few of them before writing off all Asian parlours as too iffy.  Thanks Lungor!

The SeaRay loves this subject except now that we have retired from risky active punting with whores and trannies, we only visit RnTs (but I could be lying)... Actually now that I have fully retired from any work and have so much time on my hands and whilst the weather is shit, I like to investigate dodgy Asian RnTs and often find the older, hairy over weight MILF / granny Asian's with the big C-Scar often give the best massage and a good handy and yes you all have written of Dr Caroline @ Northbridge, but she is OK.

Hi Brother Stealth,

I think to start the ball rolling, may I suggest you try either 316 Elizabeth Street or 376 Pitt Street first as both shops are always staffed with younger MLs.

The rooms are all fully enclosed and both shop are equipped with shower facilities. Just the entrances of both shops are a bit exposed so if you can get pass that, you will have a good time.

For discreet entrance (rear lane access) you can try 252B Parramatta Road Stanmore, very good facilities, plenty of options, none of those craps you had experienced before. Super hot mamasan Coco will look after you there !

Cheers

I agree - it is getting a bit too expensive when you factor in "extras". But the prices are dictated by market forces, maybe if we all collectively start refusing extras the prices will come down.
Standard pricing:
1 hour massage $60-$75
HJ $20-$30
Nude HJ $50-$80

So you are looking at minimum $110 for a massage with nude HJ - which is ridiculous.

Agreed, I have a few regular ones that I visit and I get a proper 1 hour massage with full service for $100 and one private girl where everything is on the menu like exchange massage and bbbj for $100, I haven't had full service with second one yet as I can't control myself when with her, I suffer from pe specially with this girl.

From time to time I visit amps which is around $50 for access, the reason I call it access is because most girls don't know how to massage, $30 for hr and if you want to see their boobs it's $50. So, must times it's $100 for 30 minutes if the offer is accepted.

Along the same thinking as Cellardoor above, I'm amazed that old boiler ML's still want $20 for HJ (ok acceptable) and $50 for nude and HJ when you can get that from 25-35 yo attractive ML's for the same price. For me the nude option is not because you want to see the older ML nude (I usually don't) it so you can have a bit of a feel and get off quicker, which often for me is not the case with her clothed unless she is exceptional at the HJ. So I usually decline the nude and quite often the HJ at those prices. Better off at Bodytone and the like and get it all upfront with a better looking girl as well.

  Cheers, wanderlust.

Excellent tips Lungor, you sound like a seasoned war veteran... 

Just one thing though, I thought the advice about negotiating the tip at the start so they're naked for the whole length instead of the last 15 was good. Do you or anyone have any other tips to navigate the Asian massage shops?

Yep, its pretty easy. Asian shops or not.
There are that many shops around now, its up to us guys to set the standards. If you get an "old boiler" or someone who is "customer unfriendly" just take a walk. 
Really I am from the "nanny state" and its only 5 minutes down the road and you can have another choice of an Asian princess (or another choice you like!!)
Well my 2c.
Up to you, but I must say for whatever reason. I have met some VERY nice ladies.
Maybe I'm just lucky

Someone have to invite brother Lonely Heart from aus99 to join this discussion.....

A strategy steal from him which I like, split your massage and the sex to a legit massage and a 85/90 FS join. You end paying less with more time. Also some times can be hit and miss but thai RNT are best value in market if you just want a b2b and HJ. 60-70 half hour. Most these girls don't know massage so don't border doing one hour.

Here's a Melbourne perspective.
Once upon a time every massage shop offered a half hour nude tug for $60 all paid to the house.You might then get offered additional extras,which you paid the girl for directly.Then it went up to $70 for the half hour.Then some operators decided to change their MO and effectively charge more for less.Suddenly the girl wasn't nude and all you paid the house for was a massage.Now the girl dictated whether she tugged you and whether she removed any of her clothing and the price for that was up to her.This change in MO may have been to avoid prosecution in the event of a police raid (ie "the customer only pays for a massage,we don't know what the girls are doing in the rooms") but sadly this is how most shops operate here now.Most charge $40 for 30 minutes-$70 for an hour for a massage only but the girls aren't shy in their pricing with some asking $50 just for a clothed tug.Some idiots down here seem to think that is good value and happily fall for it.
I avoid any establishment with a name as it will usually charge too much.
I benchmark what I spend against pricing from the good old days.If I can get a 30 minute nude tug for $70 or less I think I have done OK but staying for an hour is better value and I will allow $100 for that.I have been lucky to find two good regular punts where I can stay for an hour,get every service possible and not spend more than $100.
Sydney is still much better value,I have had a 30 minute massage with a tug included for $35 and on my last visit got sex for $70 all up in a 30 minute massage session.
Brisbane used to be paradise,with lots on offer but I have found slim pickings on my last few visits and no more bargains like before.

Further to my earlier post one of our fellow members has recently posted a review of a visit he made to a therapeutic massage establishment in Melbourne.They charged $100 for an hour massage and then he thought it reasonable to pay a further $100 to his therapist to get naked and give him a tug.No sex,no oral,no licence.$200 for a nude tug from a lady in her 30s.
If that is the way we are headed I will be retiring.

i agree with everything too much time has said, I must be around the same age as this man, as i too remember a nude hj was 60$ at rnt's and u could do fs with a youngster for 100$ total. at there peak the rnt's without advertising would have had 30 houses operating.  I too avoid any shop with a man and or female lying on a billboard pretending there receiving a blissful massage.  These places are a waste of time and space taking up room for real businesses.   The old style rnt's are almost extinct, with the few remaining situated, in the west, northern suburbs and east.   But these old style shops have no youngsters left.   You could include m&j's and pelham st has been watered down a bit.  The good times are over for the old school members.   Thankfully the brothel industry doesnt pull any crap and as boring as they can be with repetative service, ive been going back to them more often now.

My first ever punt was a RnT joint in Melbourne (Tiffany Massage).

Best tug in my life with a mid-20s asian girl called Annie, with the best nips ever. It only cost me about $60 or $70 for 30 minutes all inclusive nude RnT. It seems that for that rate, you can only get middle aged ladies now.

Yeah - I read about it closing down. It's a big shame. 

However, I found this ad: Relaxation Massage in CBD - melbourne therapeutic massage - backpage.com 

i wasn't sure if they were related, or if it's part of a sting by the cops. Bit scared to try that ad out. 

Where would you recommend that would be the closest to Tiffany's?

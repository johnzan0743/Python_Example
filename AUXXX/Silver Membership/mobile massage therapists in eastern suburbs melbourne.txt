hi 
Anyone know any mobile massage therapists in eastern suburbs of Melbourne ? 

I have only had one "therapist" visit me, Rachel, an Australian blonde goddess ( https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f120/...27-382-a-54214 . She was a very down to earth girl, $70 per hour and $50 extra for topless hj. its sad that i tried contacting her ever since that first time and never heard back, she probably got an actual job. 

Would love to find someone to just visit me in the weekend , give a massage, and maybe a little more  hehehe

im getting real tired of going to massage parlors and getting ripped off..paying for 1 hour, session ends in 40 mins, or the massage girl spends half the time on her phone texting or doesnt put in any effort and only focussed on extras

anyone know of any reasonably priced mobile massage therapists out there?

She actually has been working her way down the Eastcoast of NSW Rachel that is.
She recently returned from the subcontinent. Started out in Coffs Harbour Boambee and then down to Newcastle then Sydney then transited to Melbourne. She changes her address more often than her undies.

Great massage nice gal. Trying to pin her down for repeat custom may prove difficult. She believes in that old adage Variety is the spice of life!

Yeah I'm sure it's the same Girl, quite a few piercings in her face, full arm tattoos etc..  bit of a hippy and really cute with a quirky accent.

She had another appointment she had to shoot off to after me and only just managed to squeeze me in as I booked late.. This is the only reason I can think she didn't offer.

I didn't ask as I wasn't sure and there was no indication there may be.. if I'd seen the initial post in this thread before I would have asked..

Anyway it was a fantastic massage, and so much easier having it at home..

Yep thats her.

Maybe she's playing it safe.  I wont be surprised if undercover police are trying to crack down mobile massage therapists as well with so many massage shops getting raided these days. Try texting her to remind her about your session with her and ask why she didn't offer anything extra that day. 

I should hit her up soon and see if she does anything more than a topless HJ. Would love to fuck her or at least get a BJ from her

The issue is I believe she moves about not a fair bit but a lot. Getting to become a repeat client is thwarted by the fact she keeps moving on.
As for the cops don't be so paranoid. The officer in charge of enforcement works primarily in VicPol Media section and there is little manpower let alone dedicated budget to crack down on sexworkers operating outside of the system. It is not illegal for one or two workers to operate out of residential or commercial premises as long as they have applied for exemptions to registering as a sex worker.
Aside from the obvious you ensure you engage with registered sexworkers and stop worrying about raids or busts that are never going to happen. Police Media works best by rumour and innuendo. The fact remains VicPolice simply do not have the manpower to dedicate investigators to waste time and resources to busting harmless sexworkers. Now there are ones to avoid who are far from harmless.

Here is the latest link to the thread for this lass in Victorian PML

https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f120/...7-382-a-54214/

It appears Rachel has earned enough cashola to depart the Safe environs of Aus and take her chances on the Ganges Delta as other hippies do.

For those who enjoy this lasses massage her return will not be soon enough. She does a really good massage along with a top tug to finish. She knows it too.

BTW depending on how she travels likely she will return to Aus and land on East Coast and work her way down as she did before but likely this will be later in the year. She does enjoy travelling just a bit and the nomadic lifestyle that comes with it.

Rachel has removed her ads switched her mobile to voicemail and jetted off to the third world nation pretending to be first world.
Just keep your fingers crossed she doesn’t get drowned in the sewer river oops Ganges or indeed get lost in the bowels of her favoured vacation experience.

Her return is dependant upon a number of factors. Money and health are but two. Most importantly she appears to be searching for Nirvana. If only she knew to look within.
Ahh but the follies of youth. Sorry I digress...

Rachel will return hopefully in time for spring or possibly earlier. For those few who have sampled her offerings she will of course be greatly missed for those yet to sample this spirit make sure you do before she moves on to her next adventure. After all when you know the quality of a punt it changes from that (punt) to a fully immersed experience and a sure thing you can rely on.
A very pleasant easy on the eyes gal she delivers a quality massage and an equally expert finish.

We await the return of the pilgrim.

Meanwhile...

 What area are you looking for a mobile in Takeoff Sibrah ?

Rachel won’t be back until she runs out of cash or is finished with her Visa expiring... She will be back likely after Winter here so Spring over 6 months away...

She's back! I'm posting this review in this thread because I don't want the bronze peasants to know about Rachel (read end of review to find out why!)

Person's Name : Rachel

Establishment : My place

Date of Visit : 5th April 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :  https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-view-de...dId=1214675862

Phone : https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-view-de...dId=1214675862

Hours of Business : https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-view-de...dId=1214675862

Rates : $60 for 45 mins, extras are extra 

Age : 27

Size/shape : Slim, tall 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian/Italian

Services Provided : Lomi massage & lingam massage mixed

Value for money/recommend? : Absolutely. The best value. 

My experience/comments :

I was browsing through gumtree when I saw Rachel's ad. Texted her and it took a few hours for her to reply but we arranged a time for he booking. She lives just 15 mins away from me and arrived on time.

We had a long tight hug when we met and started to catch up on her trip. We both go into my room ( I live in a shared house with other housemates so we had to be really quiet) and she laid down a blanket and towel on my bed. She asks straight up how long I want the massage for and we both agree o $120 for 45 mins with lomi and lingam combined. 

Massage wasn't lomi it was more of a relaxation massage. We spent a lot of time chatting. She opened up how she hates her family and how she spent all her money on her trip and weed. I don't know if she was telling the truth or just looking for sympathy ..or maybe she is the type of girl that's just addicted to travelling. 

The most enjoyable part of the massage was when she kept putting her hand under my stomach and grabbing my penis to do a lingam massage every now and then. I have never had a massage like that and i know for sure that i'll ask her to do the same next time i book. 

35 mins on and she asks me to flip over, oils me up and starts the HJ. Something weird about her HJ is just how long it takes me to cum..I'm not sure why. 10 mins passes and she takes off her top to get me over the edge, her boobs were soft as always but she was sweaty around her chest area. Asked her why and she says that she was in a sauna few hours ago. l0l Another 5 mins or so and I finally blow my load. She tells me that i take the longest out of all her clients. 

All done and she sneaks out into the toilet to wash her hands, I get dressed and wait for her. I bank transfer her the money as i still had her details from last 2 visits. 

We head out together and she gives me another long tight hug before driving off in her old beaten up van. Will prob book her again in a few weeks. Bad news is that she said that she might quit doing massages soon because she has met a lot weird people who tried to force her to do things she wasn't comfortable with. 

It's best if we keep all intel of Rachel in Silver+ , mods can you move this thread into Silver? Link : https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f120/...27-382-a-54214

Love the “Establishment”. Lol...

She must really have smoked a lot of stuff including her money as she was supposed to be gone until after winter was over in Oz.

She probably is playing games by saying she is considering quitting.  Fairly sure this is a pattern. She will leave soon for warmer climes. Likely head North until she hits the NSW Qld border. So best make the most of her current situation.

She was heading off to the Sub continent but if she got there she didn’t stay long. That or she spent the cash so is looking to restock her piggy bank...

Person's Name : Rachel

Establishment : Her home 

Date of Visit : 30th may today

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/blac...rth/1218689045 

Phone : https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/blac...rth/1218689045

Hours of Business : No idea

Rates : $60 for 45 mins + extras

Age : 27

Size/shape : Slim 

Nationality or Ethnicity : oz

Services Provided : Massage and relief

Value for money/recommend? : Yeah i guess, not as enjoyable as the previous experiences 

My experience/comments : 

I've spoken with mods who have said to keep all the updates of Rachel in Silver+ due to a few safety concerns

So,

There were like 3 times I tried to book with her earlier this month, but she was either not home, or busy or just not replying. 

Today worked out fine, I texted her and got a reply instantly. She gave me the address of her place in Blackburn and I drove there in peak hour traffic. Took about 30 mins to reach there

She greets me at the door and give me a tight hug as always, shows me around the house (which is pretty empty not much furtniture) and into the massage room. It's dark, but warm because she had heaters turned on. She asks me to undress and on to the table i go which is ice cold, instantly made me go from hard to soft

Massage was pretty average, she didn't talk as much as which made me think one of her clients pissed her off before or that she was having a bad day, not idea. 

35 mins on and she asks me to flip.  She started with the HJ with way too much oil. At around 15 mins of jerking me off she got a bit tired and asked me to do it, i did it for a minute and handed back to her, took about another 5 mins and it wasnt happening. So i slid my hand under her tank top and grabbed her right tit which helped me get over the edge. 

It was 1 hour or so into the booking when i finally blew my load. Rachel didn't seem to care about going overtime as she had no other bookings i suppose

RJ's HJ skills are pretty bad i have to say, she tries but her technique is bad. 

WIR ? Not anytime soon

Few things i forgot to add in review, she offers either a wipedown or shower, i took the shower because that oil was really hard to get off with a wipedown. 

She explained to me later why she was upset. One of her clients had scammed her with a bank transfer, the guy pretended to transfer the money but never did send it through.

oh and yes she said she's leaving to Czech republic next month..and will be back in a month 
P,S her house smells like weed when you enter , she smokes weed all day

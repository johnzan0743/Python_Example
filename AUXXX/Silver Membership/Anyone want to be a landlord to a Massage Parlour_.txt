I will be interested if we can get a few of us on board.
I want to be the chief product tester though.

Being across the road from probably the most convenient public transport station in Sydney means developers will pay top dollar for it. Does anyone know this would be worth? I'm not up with commercial real estate but I'd be guessing a couple of mil minimum

The whole area going through redevelopment with new Metro...within next few years the whole strip could be bulldozed.. 

Would look at what DAs are on the cards at council first.

Other areas along PAC HWY will be going through changes. St Leonardâ€™s is underway..

Check Kuringai plans for Lindfield... big plans.... several massage shops in that area.

 Does Maddison St Surry Hill still operate?

So back in the early 2000s there was a house in Maddison St Surry Hill that was being used like a private share house but they did have a receptionist answering the phone and making recommendations. I think manage to go out there a few times. 

Does this still get used? I can't find any mention of it in the forum search.

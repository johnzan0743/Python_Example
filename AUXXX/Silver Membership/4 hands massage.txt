 4 hands massage
				
Post Content: 
Hey fellas,

Ive been tempted to try out a 4 hands massage for a while now, just wanted to get some feedback from those who have tried,

Is it worth it? How to you pay for extras? Just pay one girl to do the extra work? Or both? Does it stack up and be too expensive for what you get?

And if anyone has any place they reccomend in melbourne to check out this kinda service, that would be greatly appreciated!

The mechanics of a four hands session don't differ that much. In terms of finances, unless its an inclusive rate, you tip the individual MLs for the services received. So yes, you'd tip both girls for Part Two.

Probably not the answer you're hoping for but it sort of depends on you and what you're after. And you may only really find that out once you've got a session or two under your belt.

My rule of thumb (and this is just what works for me) is if I particularly enjoy a ML's (or WL's) work then throwing another girl into the mix has almost always been worth it.

I've found it depends. I've had some rippingly good 4 hand sessions, and some complete crap ones too.

Years ago at Smith St, had a 4 hand session that turned into FS and an amazingly lesbian show for which I paid $140 all up ($40 for the 30 mins, plus FS with girl 1 for +$50, and the second girl joined in for +50 as well). I once had a six hand massage which turned into the same at the old shop in Nicholson St where I was going doggy with one girl whilst a second was licking her pussy and a third was rimming me. That cost about $300, but was heaps of fun. 

I've also had expensive shit experiences, where the girls are clearly nervous if there's extras or nude involved, and some where it's clearly been on offer but the girls are just plain rude.

I'd say overall I'd miss more than I hit with four hand massage and haven't done it in years *except* when it's a situation where there's training going on, and that's the only way I'd consider doing it now.

Most dodgy shops will offer four hand for double the standard price.

Dean.

Like cl-dean I’ve has some hits and some misses. The duds tend to be the 4 hands chosen in the heat of the moment.
I’ve found that if you broach the subject of a threesome in a normal session the ML will tell you if there is a girl she would prefer doing 4 hands with. I have had a session or two turn into fs with both ML’s with lesbian action as well.....awesome stuff.

In my experience is if you've picked the 2 hottest girls in the line up, then no. The experience is waste of time.

Better to try picking one girl and ask if she is happy to do doubles. If she is, then let her pick the other girl. Because they will likely know how to make the session flow.

Personally, it's very much less than the sum of its parts. Unless you're a lie there and take it kind of guy then it's worth the investment elsewhere to set you on the doubles path.

I have done it and can't say it was worth it. Too much going on at one time.

It boils down to the girls that are involved. If the girls are comfortable with each other and have a bi tendency then you can bet it's going to be worth it. The best way to achieve this is to find a ML that you like and have seen a few times then ask her if she would like it. If she is in favour then ask her to suggest the extra ML and you'll likely be onto a winner session. Good luck.

My own feelings mirror those of the other posters. I've had heaps of 4 hands, and most have been pretty unmemorable. However.. some were freaking amazing.

I'll always say yes if it's a "training" massage for a new girl, one of my most memorable punts was one of those. It seemed that the young new girl was super keep to make me happy and basically showed the mammasan how to really spice things up. 

I also had a regular Thai pair in Melbourne that worked well together, one would basically own me above the waist and give me gfe play while the other concentrated on my more sensitive parts. Truly special events. 

I also had heaps of fun with Fergie and her partner - particularly after a few sessions it basically turned into a 3-some.

But by far most of them were a waste of money.

Agreeing with the commentary above

- pick you partner(s) wisely - asking the ladies for their preferred is paramount as stated, they will know how to work with each other.
- much more miss that hit, but the hits are standouts
- you tip both ladies (same for bot or discreetly if you favoured one)
- training punts are great, with either the older leading very well, or the trainee eager to please.


Years back had a sensational double in Melbourne.  Much younger and more stamina meant the 90 minutes was great fun with hands, mouths and parts everywhere.

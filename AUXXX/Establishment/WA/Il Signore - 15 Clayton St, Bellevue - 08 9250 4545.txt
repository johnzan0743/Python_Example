 Il Signore's Retreat Clayton St Midland

Hi,

I was a bit drunk one night, and after a pretty good strip show decided to make a visit to the only place I knew of, Il Signore's.

They were open (it was a Friday Night, around 10pm), but when I went in, there were only 2 big girls, which I had no interest in, but out of politeness I felt I ought to continue with the transaction, after the hour, they did say that they had other (better) girls at different times, and to come back after that night when they were there.. The girl that took me was friendly enough, but things were her way and not what I would expect for the money I paid. I got oral, not a bad job but I have had better, and also sex, but only after asking.

The Bedsheets had a heavy scent of male BO, not a turn on at all.

I have never been back to a sex worker because of this experience. I am only now interested in perhaps trying again. Hopefully some information on here will help me to choose a better spot this time.

Ta
Firey.

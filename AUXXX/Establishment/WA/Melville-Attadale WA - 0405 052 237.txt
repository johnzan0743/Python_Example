Visited this new Asian establishment in Attadale this week.

House is in a residential area which I always try to avoid.

Was shown to two Chinese heritage ladies both approx. early 20's.  I chose the prettier one and was shown into a private room with shared en-suite and requested to shower.  Relatively new clean premises which was appreciated.

Came back to the bed room and started to get down to business.  Young girl was reasonably enthusiastic but not overly experienced.  BJ was covered and reasonably prompt.  Quick rest and then massage after the first deed.  As I was preparing for round two - the young lass shouted out something to her Boss in Chinese.  Apparently the Boss informed her that 'the next customer was waiting outside.  Needless to say at the 30 minute mark of a one hour booking I was not overly impressed.

With a bit of pressure on managed to complete the second round in record time and finished in 'doggie' position.

With various other options around I would not hurry back.

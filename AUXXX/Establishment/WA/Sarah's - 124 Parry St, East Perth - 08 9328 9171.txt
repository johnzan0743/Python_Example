I'm not an experienced punter, but this place must be the WORST place I've ever visited!

You know something's not right when the "madam" offers you a discount before you even walk through the door. - I should have known!

3 girls to choose from. None that good looking, and quite 'old'. I went with the 'youngest' (I think).

In the room it got worse! No soap in the shower. Then the girl opened her mouth. ... No English, and NO TEETH! The few she had were black and she stank of smoke.

I put my clothes back on and left in such a F#%^ing hurry!!!

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! No one can be that desperate!!

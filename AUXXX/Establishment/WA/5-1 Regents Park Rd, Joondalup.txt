Whenever I work in Joondalup I try to visit a place. Have been to this one a few times and everytime a disappointment. New girls regularly but each wants to be worse than the one before. Tried my last time yesterday.
Not sure where they source the girls from but generally rubbish.
Cheap and nasty! 100/160

What do the girls look like? Nationality/background? Age? Figure? 
Also, what services did they provide and how do you contact them?

They advertise in the West, can't remember which number but it's under Joondalup.  It is an apartment they work from. A piece of A4 paper in the window indicates No 5 , Unit 1. (I may have the numbers reversed). I suspect you can just knock.
Asian girls, normally 2. This one was maybe 40 and 3/10. Paid extra for massage but she has no clue. In and out the room at least 4 times, leaves door open. Answers calls on the job. 
Definitely not professional. Probably working in a cafe or factory back home. Previous times similar experience. They seem to cycle them regularly but always below par. Not recommended. Only use in emergency

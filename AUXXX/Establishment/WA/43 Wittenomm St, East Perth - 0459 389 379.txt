My experience/comments : Another typical "bait and switch" Asian brothel that seem to be infesting Perth at the moment. Asked if ad pic was real, told yes. Pic sent by text of a cute girl in 20's. When I arrive I'm shown into a dimly lit room and confronted by a woman who is about 15 years older and 15kg heavier! I show the boss the pic they sent to me and she tries to tell me it's the same girl! Bloody hell, it's not that dark and I'm not that blind! Boss found a slightly younger, slimmer girl (though still nothing like the pics)  and I decided to stay for an hour, big mistake! Perfunctory massage, average blow job, and if not for me saying slow down I would have been out in 15 min. I dragged it out for about 35-40 min then finished off and got out. Crappy, rushed service. Bait and switch ads, would not recommend!

Hi fartichoke
No, it was a Locanto ad. Have not been able to find it to post here. I will keep a lookout and post if I see it again.

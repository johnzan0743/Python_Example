I was down this way last night walking around checking out Adelaide after dinner and walked past this place. Marilyns.

Went u the stairs and was met by a guy who looked pretty shabby and after the entrance of a daggy door was a small dimly lit waiting room with a small pool table. I was taken into the room and the guy said he would get the girls. He said it was FS for 150 for 30 mins or 200 for an hour.

As I sat there and looked around I thought ... nope. And so I got up and said to the guy that I didnt have enough cash and I would have to ome back.  The place just did not excite me.

Anyone actually been there ?

Gents, just FYI, I think this place was the one in the siege today.

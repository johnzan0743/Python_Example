Took one for the team last week.  Called up the add below and went for a look.  Paid the $$$ and laid down on the table and as she began struck up a bit of a conversation.  Pretty quickly it became evident there is absolutely positively nothing more on offer here.  No tell tale signs around the room although from the add/building it was a 50/50 bet.

Thanks for the review, Nmerk11. I have been wondering about this one. I called the number a few weeks ago and got the impression that it was very legit so I did not pursue it on that occasion. I will definitely not be visiting there now.

 Massage Crackdown - Vic
				
Post Content: 
Hi Guys,

Just a community service announcement to stay safe out there. It looks like they are cracking down (again) on shops etc.. with a few closed for business.
Dandenong and Noble Park are the latest ones (2 days ago) and I was told they also closed one in Clayton and another in Hawthorn in the past two weeks...

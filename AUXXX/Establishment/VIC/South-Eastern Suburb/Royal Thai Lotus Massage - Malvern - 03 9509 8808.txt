My experience/comments : A visit in the mid-afternoon. Receptionist was rather surly upon entry, and I was told to wait. 15 minutes or so later I was told to head upstairs to the end room. The room is very well-appointed and the massage table very comfortable.  Asked for a medium to hard massage and got a very professional full body massage from Vee. No extras asked for or offered but a most enjoyable and relaxing one hour massage.  Receptionist had changed by the time I was leaving - much nicer and lovely in many ways!

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 261 Glenferrie Rd, Malvern (03) 9509 8808

 Hours of Business : 10am-10pm

 Rates : $45 for 30 min

 Age : mid-20s?

 Size/shape : petite

 Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

 Services Provided : Massage - TOFTT

 Value for money/recommend? : Yes for massage

 My experience/comments : Decided to give this place a shot as I was in the area. Clean establishment, reasonable appearance all around so should have been a warning. The nice towel/flower arrangement on the table was another question mark although there were tissues on the bench but nothing else.
Bee, the ML, walked in as I was down to jocks so thought discretion was best and stayed like that onto the table. Immediate downer when the full length towel was draped all over and we proceeded into the various massage points.
At one stage the hope exceeded the actual events as inside leg was brushed but nowhere near the tackle. Towel moved and adjusted all around to access back and legs but never a hint of jock movement beyond tucking the towel in. Arms moved around and always out of any contact. Then the hot towel rub-down to remove oil - again no contacts.
After being told to flip - towel held up to prevent any view of jocks by her, finished up with the usual slight rub on shoulders and head then the standard set of hand claps and "thank you very much".
Maybe I should have asked but there never seemed to be any chance of any extras being offered.
Anyway - TOFTT - maybe others have been more successful.

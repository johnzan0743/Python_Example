My experience/comments :


I was down in Melbourne for couple of weeks and decided that it was time for a punt. Since I was in that area I ended up at 3 Fleet Street, Somerton. Had about 3 girls available at the time, but decided to book Nikki for 30 minutes as she sounded really friendly.

Went upstairs to the room with Nikki, she helped me to take off my clothes, and gave me fresh towels for the shower. After the shower, we moved to the bed. and started to some DFK, which was followed by BBBJ(even without prompting), the feeling was really good, didn't know how to describe it. She then grabbed a condom and then jumped on top for some cow girl. After a few min of cowgirl I decided that I want some basic mish position action, followed by some doggy.Eventually I stop for a rest and push her legs down straight and together me still inside her. I quicken the pace it all becomes too much and I explode inside her. She cleans me up we have a kiss and a cuddle and yes time is up so I shower and dress and head off down the stairs.

I visited Studio Honeys last night, made a 30 minute booking with Skye. Went to room, health check...ok. Then jumped in shower.... after 15 seconds the water turned to cold. I stood in the shower freezing and covered in soap waiting for the water to warm up. After 10 minutes of splashing myself with cold water I gave up hope of the hot water returning and exited the shower shivering. Stepped out of the bathroom only to find no heating in the room. Laid down for a massage, but after a few minutes I just had to get up and put some clothes on and leave in an effort to warm up. So basically I blew $120 and the highlight of the booking was jumping back into the car with the heater on full.
If that is how much they care about their clients I wont return. Skye was apologetic and embarrassed, nothing against her as it was not her fault. Not a nice experience in the middle of winter.

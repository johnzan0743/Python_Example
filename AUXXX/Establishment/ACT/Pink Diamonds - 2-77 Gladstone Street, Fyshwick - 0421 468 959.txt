My experience/comments : This was their first day open. I arrived at 7:30pm and was their first customer.

They were not organized.

Anyway - paid cash - declined a receipt...

Into the room. Shower together. Onto the bed. Many interruptions from the male staff (owner and driver). She decided she needed a smoke. I pointed to the sign on the wall - 'No Smoking'. She replied "my room, my rules".

So - she had several smokes - then left to go to the bathroom...

A barely adequate BJ - ah hell, not too happy - knock on the door - the hour is up - rolled her into mish and finished the job - showered and left...

As always, YMMV

Well, it wasn't the best punt I have ever had...

However - the place has some promise - just maybe not the WL. The rooms were fairly large and well appointed - nice big shower - and the whole place was freshly painted. No aircon, but.

I might try it again in winter when it's not so hot. With a different WL.

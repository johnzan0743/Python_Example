This a new brothel in Brisbane between Brisbane and the Gold Coast
First time visit totally disgusted. Paid $ 160 for 3/4 hour with Mona HK lady with a great boby however, a real starfish, no kissing , no touching, CBJ was below normal, was turned off asked for a hand job and put on a rubber glove with lube and tried to make me come well by that time the old boy has had enough and will not rise. 
She asked if interested in a massage which I agreed and processeded to cover me with towel and massage me through the towel, what a joke 
First and last time there all out there beware
cheers petross

Checked out this establishment.  There was one tall very friendly Aussie, about 22, curvaceous.  Other girl was also tall but slim Thai.  Nice new premises, slightly pushy blonde african "mamsan" who, whilst attractive, appears very much just the manager.  She said that Mona was popular and had many regular customers.  The thai lass was busy, and the Aussie was not my type, so cannot give a blow by blow account.

Value for money/recommend?: hmmm....yes?

My experience/comments: I heard that you can get a HJ for $50 at Arowana so decided to check it out. The establishment seems to be new and clean, and the manager was fairly friendly when I walked through the door (he told me I was the first customer of the day at approx 12:30pm)  I told him I had heard about the $50 HJ and asked if that was correct.  He told me it was, and he called the girls to come downstairs for the intros.  I actually picked the first girl that walked through, Layla, as she looks like the sort of girl I go for.  I paid my $50 to the manager, and he gave me $30 back in a folder to give to the girl.  

When we were in the room we got undressed and onto the bed.  Layla said there were two options: 1. HJ with a condom on, or 2. HJ with a glove.  I was a bit stunned at that as I have always had bareback HJ's but went with the glove option as that is something I haven't had (always keen to try something new.....I guess....*)  She told me that touching was allowed but nothing internal.  The HJ was not bad at all actually, a good pace, rhythm, and firmness.  But she was not able to get me across the line after about 15 minutes.  She told me that the buzzer was going to go soon, and wanted me to leave with a smile on my face.  So I took over and finished the job.  After the cleanup we chatted for a few minutes about exercise and stuff, and she walked me out.

I am on the fence about recommending the service or not.  There was nothing bad about it, and the price is decent for a happy ending.  But if the WL cant do what I can do myself I wonder why I would pay for it?  Oh, what the heck.  For $50 I will try again sometime soon and hope for a better outcome.

$40-$60 you can get a 30 min massage and hand job at many of the Asian massage places in SE QLD. Doesn't seem like good value.

Person's Name: Mimi

Establishment: L1, 25 Rowe street Eastwood

Contact Details/Address: L1, 25 Rowe street Eastwood

Hours of Business: 10am - 10pm

Prices: FS $85/30

Age: 30

Size/shape: 5'7", size 8, awesome natural breasts!

Nationality or Ethnicity: Hong Kong

Services: FS, covered

Value for money/recommend?: Very much!

My experience/comments: I first saw Mimi in 2009 when she had very little English. She could say "I love you", but this was not appropriate while she was being fucked hard.

Back then she would start with BBBJ, which was very intense, but she didn't want CIM because she enjoyed being fucked.

I stopped visiting, because the establishment (main man named Peter) is a bit grotty, and you have to share the shower in the hall.

I went back in November on a Thursday and surprise : Mimi was there! English much better now. Covered blow job ('next time you have Shower', she said) and then flip her over for some pounding. 

You can't really tell what it is about some women, this one is just sexy. She really enjoys fucking!

Highly recommended.

Information from various places is that last year, this place closed and the business moved to Infinity Bordello in Gladesville. I walked by in November last year and all the signage was gone and the curtains had been removed from the windows. On another Forum (I can't find it now) there was even a link to the "For Sale" advert for the property. But in my "stroll by" of the Eastwood establishments this morning, I noticed a new sign in the window (black lettering on a yellow background) indicating "Now Open". The sign simply had the address of the place - no other indication of the type of business. Seems to be back in business.

Mylifeisfantasi,

We seem to be talking about different places (upstairs and downstairs). But it does seem that "upstairs" is back in business.

Cheers

You are a mine of information EG. I haven't been here for quite a while. I must try it again soon as there was the occasional gem here. There was a big rivalry between upstairs and downstairs here, but I'm really surprised that upstairs is behind Infinity. Get in touch mate.

I found my regular here, though she's not so regular now as she works in difficult out of the way places at inconvenient times. I know she left here because she was worried about council raids.

Peter sounds more like downstairs here. I did know the names of the upstairs mamasan and papasan (starts with a J?) but it's been a long while now and the memory fails me.

Henry,

I am not necessarily on firm ground here. I have been known to be wrong before. But the circumstantial evidence is that the original operators of the upstairs place moved to Infinity. There were the adverts in the papers "Eastwood - Now at Gladesville - Same ladies, same prices". Then there was my walk by November last year (one of my reviewed punts at 90 Rowe St), where I saw that the place had all the curtains and the illuminated sign removed. There was also some discussion on other forums. Certainly the place was for sale - on whatever forum I read about that, they had a link to the Estate Agent's advert, and one of the punters there commented that they had left the rubber mat in the bath tub. As my alter ego said some time back, there is probably a PhD to be done the dynamics of the ownerships of the oriental R&T and FS shops in Sydney

Person's Name: janice (i think)
Establishment (if applicable): 

Contact Details/Address: 1a / 2-25 Rowe st, Eastwood

Hours of Business: (if known or applicable) 10-7pm

Prices:$85 / 30 FS

Age: about 30

Size/shape: Size 8

Nationality or Ethnicity:Chinese

Services: CBJ, FS

Value for money/recommend?: yes

My experience/comments: Went here on a wednesday. No line up given by the young guy at who answered the door and shown straight to the room (1 of 2). In walks Janice. Looked good clothed, pleasant face and good english. Straight away says $85 and i know it's FS but confirm anyway. Skip the shower and undress. She strips down to her g-string and embrace. we exchange soft caresses and she is nibbling my earlobes and running her nails down my back. Very GFE 

On with the dom and into a CBJ.I'm rock hard by now. CG and she is riding hard. After a few minutes, we shift gears into standing mish (i'm standing...and glad as that massage table was doing my back in). She says go faster and puts both my hands on her B-cups. A bit of nipple tweaking elicits delicious moans and Janice's legs are wrapped around my back now. Sensing the impending climax, i call for doggie. Back on the rickety massage table and she is arching her back as i enter. A frenzied few minutes leads us to the inevitable and we collapse on that table, covered in sweat but content. after a good couple of minutes just quietly lying there, we disengage and Janice cleans me up. I let her shower first and then do the same (shower is across the small hall and as crappy as i last remember it) before grabbing a business card from the guy at the front and heading off. No frills but sometimes WLs like Janice make it worth it.

Venue completely closed and has changed into some Korean women's gather place. Pity - one of my very first punts was at this place.

Hi All,
Level 1
12a Renwick Street
Leichhardt
Ph95183368

I've learned in life that is the journey and not the destination that is important. I think it was Confucius who said that a journey of a 1000 miles begins with the first step.

Well, in this case the destination turned out to be 40's Japanese Maria and ladies and gents she was a sight to behold, but more on her later.

I wanted to look my best and once again returned to Effie who is my personal barber and works in the shop at the end of the tunnel at Central Station. This time I wanted both a haircut and a shave. Folks that Effie should be hired by K-Rudd as she is the consummate spin doctor. Why, she'd have him campaign on the home insulation scheme by claiming that if a bunch of houses burned down that would be a boost for the building industry. An example of Effie's spinning can be noted in the following exchange while she was giving me a shave.

Jack: Effie my face is stinging. What's goin on?
Effie: Jack did you cut yourself shaving about three years ago?
Jack: Yes. Why do you ask?
Effie: It's bleeding again.

Well, her initial efforts of dealing with this minor tragedy  were about as effective as BP in the Gulf of Mexico, but using half a box of tissues and applying a lot fo pressure to my chin she stopped the flow of claret. And pressure it was. Not only did she stop the flow from my chin, but the flow of circulation to half my face which remained numb for the rest of the afternoon.

When I left I may not have been dressed up like Donald Trump, but I was feeling just as fine.

In the food hall in Chinatown I met my nephew Efrem Zimbalist Farquar and my mate Emp 'The Pirate' Melpunter. We had a Chinese feed and discussed which of us would best be typecast as a drooling village idiot. In the end we agreed it was a three way tie and each of us bore somewhat of a resemblance to the banjo boy in the movie Deliverance.

Lately I've been getting myself into situations I find it hard to get out of. Yes, I can get out of them, but philosophically it is a problem. I get into bad situations as I take the advice of relatives and try to implement it in my life. My nephew Edd 'Kookie' Byrnes taught me the 'no walk' policy. He says real punting is going in and gambling. To go to several brothels before you make a choice is like not betting in a horse race until you know its fixed race. So, I have adopted this policy. My other nephew Farquar says I have to get out of my comfort zone. He chastises me for always going to Bellevue and Billy's and Newtown. So, this time I went to Renwick St. Leichhardt.

I rang the bell with some anticipation and also trepidation. It was answered by Maria.

Now, why she called herself Maria I will never know. She said she was Japanese and I'd have thought that Yumiko or Yasuko or Tomoko would have worked a lot better. Then again why does the chicken cross the road?

Maria looked mid to late 40's. She had a bathrobe wrapped around her and asked what I wanted to pay for full service. I asked what she charged and she said $180 for the hour. As she says that I am thinking that the odds that I'll pay that are about the same as a meteor the size of a golf ball hitting me in the forehead in the next 30 seconds. I offered $150 which she latched onto immediately and this told me I was her sucker for the day.

Well, Maria is well over 4 feet talk. When she removed the robe she revealed some rather nice breasts with protruding nipples and a stomach that looked like she swallowed an LA Lakers basketball. Let's face it; a truckload of sashimi has gone down the old gullet to create that sight. I was NOT turned on and was NOT horny.

This whole ghastly situation was compounded by the face that she laughed inappropriately throughout our time together and this started to put me on edge and annoy me. I decided to ask her about it and the following exchange occurred:

Jack: Why do you laugh all the time?
Maria: Because I am happy.
Jack: Happy about what?
Maria: I don't know.
Jack: Yeah.

She then does a so-so bbj and we do mish and cowgirl. I was not into the session. Little Jack wanted to be elsewhere and so did I. I got her to give me a handjob, but in the end I got myself over the line.

They do have a shower there and it is clean with a generic soap bottle.

We talked and she noted how he oldest client had been 98 years old and

Maria: His cock got harder than yours.
Jack: Now you didn't say that just to cheer me up did you?

She told me she was going back to Japan for 3 months.

She will not be missed by me.

Jack

JK, sounds like the highlight of your afternoon was pressing the lift button at the food court.  You should have tried those 3 milfs sat behind us - you would have had more success I reckon.  You'll be glad to know I bought what I was after and went straight home, no dilly dallying - although I was nearly tempted as I had to park outside butterfly relaxation in . It was a close call/

Well it has been some 6 Years since the SeaRay popped into this Japanese P.M.L. and Yesterday needing an Oriental Wank, ended up here again... The Lady was I guess 40-50 and after paying $70 for a 1/2 oil massage which was really a :Fiddle of the Piddle" she took her clothes off to reveal she has NO breasts (like -A but big nipples) and her nice shaven Japanese Cunt which I did NOT lick but would have liked too.

Lvl 1/12a Renwick St, Leichhardt - 02 9518 3368Ad on Locanto.Was in the area remembered seeing the ad offering massage with prostate massage as well.Just walked up without booking 2 ladies on offer nothing like the photos on web site.Paid $70 for 45 min massage with prostate care massage was not very good or sensual and when time came for prostate massageasked if I want mini vibrator or finger went finger but she was rushing it all and a bit rough without easing into it slowly which is how I prefer.Finally blew then she finished with body stretching my limbs and torso a first for me then asked me to fill in a questionnaire about the service another first for me. WIR probably not unless there was a girl with more experience as the young girl Kim her name was seemed very inexperienced.

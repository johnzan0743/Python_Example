I've been a regular at Wicked Lolipops for some time now. Its got a great incall place near North Parramatta and the girls are consistently young, hot and fresh. A lot are completely new to the business and you might end up as one of their first customers ever. Often the girls are might be very passionate and offer many good hard to find extra's too. You have to be quick sometimes though as some of the good ones don't always stay too long. 

The manager is always very helpful and accomodating. Highly recommended if you're willing to pay for quality.

Have been told I need to mention specific girls there and what we did. Trouble is it seems most of the girls have moved on so I didn't want to talk about any which aren't there anymore. Only one I think that's left is Alexia. Really pretty busty greek girl who coincedentally, also did greek style with me too. Got a really passionate GFE with her with greek and fucked her big tits too. We really clicked and she seemed to really like me and knew just what to say to make you feel good. If it was all an act though she deserves an oscar. I definitely plan to see her again some time soon.

ok, lets try this again.

Alexia made me feel really good about myself, saying she'd do the GFE because I was pretty cute, would like to hope she doesn't say that to everyone but who knows.

Cost was $300 for the hour, $50 more for the GFE and $200 extra for the greek. Was a very passionate service with lots of passionate kissing to begin as we undressed eachother, she seemed really into it and was really into the greek as well. Great personality and good to talk to afterwards as well when I still had time left at the end of it.

I booked an outcall with this girl last night.   I was a tad reluctant to book as I'd called to book with one of the other girls, who was not available.  I'm now kind of glad my first choice wasn't working.

Zoe was a class act, and although a curvy girl, her face was amazingly beautiful.  She was charming, very warm and relaxed, and was awesome company.   She didn't waste time with messing around, and was into the service fairly rapidly.  

Zoe has a very good French technique, and is VERY willing to allow a client to get the most out of a GFE booking.  She's beautifully responsive to DATY and touching, and doesn't shy away from kisses or cuddles in any way, shape or form.

Between goes, she did offer a massage, and she is magical with that.  Very relaxing (although that may have been the previous efforts showing).  She is great company.

Multiple shots at goal were NOT a problem, and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed my time with her.  I will be booking her again, and hope to book the girl I originally took a look at!

I tried to book Izzy at one time myself.  She was only EVER available late night and the guy who worked there actually told me she really wasn't worth the wait!  As I said in my earlier review, I tried to book Lily, heard GREAT stuff about her from a mate, but was told she basically only does Tuesday Nights and occasional Wednesday day times and Saturday Day times.  She's apparently going to start doing a Friday or Saturday Night a month though... can't WAIT to see her, he looks awesome.

Zoe though, was great value as per my review!

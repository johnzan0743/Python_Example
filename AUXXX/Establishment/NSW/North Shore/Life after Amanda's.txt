 Life after Amanda's
				
Post Content: 
The change from Amanda's to Miss Heavens and the move to Cleg Street pose so many questions for  rusted on Amanda's patrons.
Does the BBBJ ban force us to look elsewhere? What is the best alternative venue for MILF lovers? Riverwood? North Parramatta? A good private?
Or should we give Cleg Street a little time and hope that it eventually becomes an adequate replacement? The lack of recent reviews of Cleg Street suggests many punters are sitting on the fence or going elsewhere. Any thoughts on places to try?

The best way would be to go to Cleg St and use your charm and seduction techniques and find out. Tip; make sure you are thoroughly clean and charming.

According to my source, there is a lot of dissatisfaction amongst some of  the  ladies at Riverwood, and several top producers will start new careers at Gentleman's Paradise on Monday. Apparentlly , the new 
establishment will feature only 8 ladies per shift, and quality control will be strict.

Just did a thread on Gentlemans paradise then saw some intel in here

Looks like it might be filled with ladies who will be hopping from other places

If they charge Riverwood prices and have decent WLs, then Miss Heavens will be in trouble

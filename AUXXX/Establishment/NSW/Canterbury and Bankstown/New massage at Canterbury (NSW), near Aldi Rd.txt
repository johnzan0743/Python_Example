 New massage at Canterbury (NSW), near Aldi Rd
				
Post Content: 
Whipped by on Saturday. Just down from Aldi Rd on Canterbury Rd, they were decorating a place advertising as "Natural Massage".
On the one hand, the external decorations (faux gold leave carving) suggests legit, on the other hand: "Natural Massage" ?!?! Come on.

Not sure if I can whip by, it's just a tad toooo close to home, but will keep my AUXXX colleagues informed if anything happens.

Yes, I know the place you mean. Went there many times. I assume that this place Dr Bob is a new incarnation on the old or nearby site.

It's a completely new fitout (thank goodness) but they still have the Natural Massage sign from the old premises up. But I don't think they are done renovating yet, so the sign may change before they actually open for business.

A girl in Campsie told me that it is a new location for her boss' chain of legit (as far as I know) Thai shops. 

I'll toftt as soon as the light turns green!

From a quick glance yesterday while driving pass it appears it has the making of a legit establishment. If so, it wouldn't surprised me as there is spike of new legit Thai massage joints popping up in local suburbia. I guess we will find out once it opens for business, what do you think guys, shall we take short bets that it will be legit?

It's definitely legit.  It's the sister shop of On Smile Thai Massage in Campsie, which is totally legit, so I assume this one is too.  Apparently the owner has a number of legit Thai shops in the area.

I went here 27 March. Can confirm bj4242's intel that this place is totally legit. Good Thai massage. Do not expect anything else.

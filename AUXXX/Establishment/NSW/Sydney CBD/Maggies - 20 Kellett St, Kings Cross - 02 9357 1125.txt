this place has been here for years and nowadays most of the best looking girls here are actually "supergirls"  ( girls who have had certain surgical adjustments that allow them to become girls...... if you know what i mean  )  and not that theres anything wrong with that  in my opinion! Well worth a visit ,warm and friendly atmosphere and lots of lovely thai "girls" to choose from...... especially if you like supergirls !

$170 for the half seems a bit steep,

I suppose they survive on the tourist trade.

I think the full name of this joint is Maggie's Gentleman's Club.

Not being a gentleman it never occurred to me to enter.

Has definitely been around for ages. Used to frequently find myself parked at the bar there during the late 80's when it was known as "The Continental". In those days, there was a fairly even mix between Asian & non-Asians which I beleive remained the case a fair way into the 90's. Some very raunchy memories from that place but have only been inside the door once in well over 10 years. Found the girls reasonably attractive and the service rather mechanical.

Been a good number of years since I have frequented this establishment, but don't think it has changed too much as have been inside the premises a few times over the years. Probably the best description is that it is a poor mans The Penthouse in Pitt Street.

A licensed bar, with bar stools at the helm, plus a few tables and chairs scattered around. Just walk in, head to the bar at the back (scout around the premises for potential punt along the way) order a drink (not free) and chat to WLs who may or may not come up to you. Thats about it. Upstairs is where all the punting action is. I actually had one unmemorable punt here some 15 or so years back. The room I punted in was large and clean. Also I remember the bar can get packed with blokes at night so a day visit is more discreet and probably see more WL who are available 

Last time I popped in it was very Asian dominated in terms of WLs. If in the neighbourhood probably not a bad thing to just walk in and have a peek, costs nothing (over the years it didn't)

Good morning Mr K

It was indeed unmemorable. As you may have already detected, I clearly remember the room description.
You cant get a more unmemorable punt than that.

My God, did not realize this place is still operating. Last time I visited, probably about fifteen or more years ago, it was a dive, One can only imagine what it's like today if no major changes have taken place. Must pop in next time I'm in the area. If nothing else just for nostalgia time.

The place is finished I walked past and I think it does not even have one working girl on now. Kellett street is a ghost town you can play cricket on the road...

Yep - I think they're just starting up. An email from the Kings Court mailing list:







			
				Kings Confidential

We have a new place at 2/261 Parramatta Rd, Glebe, NSW 2037. The entrance is next to the Kings Court massage on Parramatta Road.

At the rear you can use the same private entrance and stairs as Kings Court. Ask the receptionist at Kings Court to let you through to Kings Confidential.

It has separate waiting rooms and bedrooms from Kings Court Massage. 



The ladies at 'Kings Confidential' offer full service.

The managers are Jenny, who most of you would know, and Elly, who has become a very nice manager for the new section.

Jenny has meticulous standards and has done a superb job of preparing elegant and sophisticated rooms for your enjoyment, and she is very fussy about the girls who work with us. She will only hire ladies who genuinely enjoy working. These girls are not full time workers - they only come to work when they are horny - so you will have to ring to see when they are available, and bookings are essential. 

The prices are very reasonable for the eager kind of ladies we are presenting. They are well groomed, they enjoy what they are doing and are drug free.

Jenny is passionate about making sure customers are happy and explains on the phone, "I really make you feel that you can come here to have a good time. You can think of it as a love affair and not like going to a nasty brothel that is money oriented. We are not going to have a big number of girls in a line up because we want to make you feel special."

Because the customers are mostly from Kings Court they are the nicest of customers and so far every one of the new Kings Confidential girls have remarked about how well the customers have treated them and how different this place is.

So if you are looking for something a little more than the Kings Court Massage experience, try Kings Confidential.

Prices are $150 for a half hour, $220 for 45 mins and $280 for the one hour.

Crystal is a Mediterranean beauty of 24 years petite and busty with misty green eyes. She has worked as a dancer and has an incredible body with natural DD on top. She is only available this week on Wednesday and Thursday so ring and talk to Jenny on the new 'Kings Confidential' number 02 9191 5566.

Olivia is a 25 year old slim size 8 brunette with a natural D cup!

In general the Kings Court massage girls are not the ladies who will be working at Kings Confidential, however we are having trouble stopping Amber from sneaking over there because she just loves sex. You may know her as a chubby, cheeky and very busty 22 year old. She is on holidays until next weekend.

We'd probably prefer posts like this to be accompanied by a review so that members can decide whether it's worth spending
their cash on, or just another lying ad.

Fair enough. My bad, was just a quick cut and paste job to answer a question. Will keep that in mind.

I remember that Kings operated Golden Cat in the lane way behind Kings Court. Its long gone however I remember it had upgrades from the massage. 
I still think that the massage girls are fantastic quality and none that I have ever met are WL.

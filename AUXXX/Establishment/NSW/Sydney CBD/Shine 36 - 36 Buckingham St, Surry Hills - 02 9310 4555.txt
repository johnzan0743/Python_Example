Price: As advertised as 130, when i went in i was told its under new management and that its 160/hr
Girls: I was introduced 3 girsl, all genuinely korean, their body shapes are relatively tall for asians rather than petite. Anyway i think they're wereing high heels.. ~165~175cm. 1 of the 3 girls have a pretty cute face (phew).
Service: The service was sensational, the girl (forgot her name) firstly gave me a wash and then started with a great BJ, perhaps one of the best i've had, she really knew how to turn a guy on. She is a bit quiet but if you talk to her a little bit she'll become happy, giggly.. although most of the time was talking in korean which i did not understand. Finished with another quick shower.

 New Tokyo House, 36 Buckingham St, Surry Hills
				
Post Content: 
36 Buckingham St is now called "New Tokyo House", and I think it has again changed hands, but managers (I've seen two men on my three visits) were both Korean.  

I've only been introduced to Korean girls, although they say there are Japanese as well as Korean on www.syd99.com.  I've had reasonable experiences on each of my visits.  Always BBBJ, usually with "fire & ice".  

On my first vist I chose Jini.  She likes to take charge and do things the same each time.  I'd previously been with her at 509 Crown Street Surry Hills, which has now closed.  Jini's BBBJ while showering you is great, as is her massage and fire & ice, but  FS is only 5/10, as she wants to take total control.

Today I was with Nabi, and the reverse was true.  Her massage was a fail grade, the BBBJ pretty good, but the sex was really good.  

Both Jini and Nabi are very slim, with small boobs, which is how I like an Asian girl.  Both are very pretty.  

My other punt her was below par, but 2 out of 3 isn't bad.  So if you like the Korean experience, and BBBJs in particulare, this place is worth a try.

I heard that the old management of Ace 359 were the ones who moved here. If there is a girl named Mimi there, please let us know. Very attractive, slim. She was the second best ball licker I have ever tried. English wasn't that good, but you could feel that she was enjoying herself. I could feel her trying to push my cock out when I played with her clit.

Rampaging gang smashes up Sydney brothel

Rampaging gang smashes up Sydney brothel 

Stephanie Gardiner 
July 22, 2011 - 10:00AM.

Six men stormed into a Sydney brothel with a fake gun and assaulted a man, before smashing the walls, mirrors and a computer, police say.

Police said the group went to the new Tokyo House brothel on Buckingham Street, Surry Hills, about 7pm yesterday and threatened staff with the replica pistol.

A male employee was ordered to get on the ground, where he was hit on the head, police said.

The group used a mallet to smash holes in the walls, then sprayed paint around the property, broke the mirrors and the computer, before running out empty-handed.

Officers found the replica gun, a metal mallet and spray cans, which have been taken for examination.

Surry Hills police duty officer Inspector Andrew Koutsoufis said it was not clear why the men raided the brothel.

"It could be a case of intimidation; that's one of the avenues we're looking at," Inspector Koutsoufis said

Anyone with information is asked to phone Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

Not sure if it's been posted anywhere, but 104 Roseville have taken over thsi shop.

I saw Julie today and see from the 104 Roseville thread that she is well reviewed there.

Rates today were $110/30, $145/45 & $160/60.

I took the 45 option and was taken by the hamd up the steep stairs of this terrace house establishment.

The back room has a shower and Julie washed me thouroughly whilst singing to herself. She has a nice tight body with enhanced B cups and a flat tum with a landing strip. She has a meaty muff and was quite delicious.

After a cat bath Julie gave me a deep BBBJ and took me down to the base a few times. An excellent BJ in. GFE way. 

From there we went cow girl with DFK, some hard doggy and finished with mish.

Gotta say that the room was HOT. I've done bikram yoga a few times but never thought I'd be fucking in those 30+ temps.

Julie works Wed and Thurs.

I notice from the website link above that Lisa, Emma as well as Julie are at Shine36. Cheaper at 104 and the facilities there sound better than 36.

 A Girl  named Sue
				
Post Content: 
$170 for the hour

only one girl available Sue a 25 yo korean, with deer eyes and face straight out of a Japanese cartoon. A to B cup nice nipples (aint they all)
At a guess I would say Sue is new to FS, Liable to be either sweet gentle GFE or a starfish (or both)

The wash area was almost as big as the bed room. Tokyo house use to provided a soapy (not on a matress) type service so the wash areas are huge. 
Seems they read about the hot rooms as there was a floor standing AC unit in the room.

Sue Thouroghly washed me before washing herself.

As she entered the room I sat up and went to pull her towards me, she got me to lie back down and dried my feet with some tissues before drying her neattly trimmed pussy with a tissue.

She then prepared a condom and started kissing my nipples while putting the condom on my semi errect memember. I started to caress her , so she rolled on her back and pulled my head to her breasts which I kissed and carressed. As my hands moved south she stopped me and sat up, I dived down and kissed the top of the mound, she said no and I said OK, She then reach over and got the wet stuff before appling a tiny dollop on my middle finger after which she lay back down placing my finger to her clit.
Working her breasts with my mouth while dancing my finger on her clit had her quitely moaning, it appeared a mixture of fake and real, whenever my finger went off target the moans stopped but the 'oh yeah's continued. Watching cute little dears eyes face lite with pleasure inspired my member to swell and the condom was on and in place, I was ready for some me time. I raised my head and knelled in front of her, she said "suck" and pulled my hips to wards her face. I inserted my cock in her mouth and started to kiss around her hips, my finger remained dancing on her clit. I kissed I around what I suppose is teh knap of the groin she pulled back but let me continued comfortable this was not a sneak DATY attack ( would have loved to but no means no (or did in this case)).
when my finger was on target her CBJ was energectic, but when ever I slipped off target or headed south for extra wetness, she would stop any action on the CBJ and just held my cock in her mouth with no motion. 
Onto the Main event she lay flat on her back, no lube required but as I started to insert (slowly) she pushed her hand against me and said "slow", before giggling upon realising I was being slow very slow. She was tight and the entry was one those beautiful momemts in sex, a shared moment of tenderness. This feeling pettered out and I thought oh this is going peared shaped as she just lay there, eyes closed pushing her arse into the bed. After some experiementing we got into a rythym that worked for both of us, not too long after she came, no doubt about it , it felt wonderfull and goey and left my body in tingles. I slowed down for a bit to an almost nperceptable grind to let her recover, as I started to move again she asked "You will orgasm?". I pointed at the pillow and her arse, OK so with her arse up and her legs further open then before I continued on round 2 for her. It took me another 10 minutes of slow grinding to get over the line by which time she seemed to be enjoying her self again, whether she cam again beofre me or with me or just missed it I dont know but for me the ending was majical and seemed to last forever 
 I was drenched in sweat so off to the shower to clean up, she washed after me before giving me a very lite back massage,
I turned over and starred into her lovely deers eyes as she aimless prodded my thigh, we chatted a little during which the receptionist said over the intercom "10 min warning". Then as I started to dress she started to give me wet (but no tongue) kisses on the mouth.

I left in two minds about the experience.

I had gone in hope of the raunchyness I had experienced at the sister shop (emma and julie spring to mind), yet instead had an experience more akin to being a 24yo having sex for the first time with a sweet innocent new GF.

Jsomeone, congratulations on your technique. Slowly and surely she loosened up for you to bring your thoughts of your early conquests of virgins back.  I think if you trained her a bit you would soon get her to giive her DATY. Yes Julie and Emma are very high standards to judge Sue against. 

Hope she come to 104 as well.

Interesting that a lot of girls use tissues to dry themselves so I assume they do not trust the laundering of the towels.

Not quite what I meant as I never been with a Virgin.

Young Koreans often play the coy sweet innocent act. Many Punters find them too precious.

Howdy all,

Has anyone been to this place lately?

It's an orange painted terrace, close to Central. I believe it is a sister shop to Roseville Rose.

I am suprised no one has reviewed this place in years.

Hi Jack,
 I went there last in 2012 just after it opened . Seen a girl called Lala who worked at Roseville Rose and also at 116 Hampden St Artarmon. She had a Chinese tattoo on her leg that translates as  "love always".

Went back a short time later and it was closed. I heard Christine couldn't make a go of it. Never been back again. ......2012 is ancient history in brothel speak , sorry not much help.

I can confirm your suspicions Jack. I knocked on the door a few weeks back and a guy did answer the door but they were fully booked.

When I asked what kind of girls were available, he said check the web site: 9sgirl.com.au.

Unfortunately it looks like the site is down so I guess we'll have to wait and see.

I visited this place a few times, a fair few years ago when it was still Shine 36. I do remember one bird I went to see there. Ivy. Early 20s Korean. 160cms, BBW, Size 12, Massive E cups. Can't forget that punt, that's for sure.

Well, mystTiger,

I saw the lovely Brooke there a couple of years ago and the joint was overpriced, underserviced and designed for mug tourists and local yokels.

The ladies, while attractive, have 'I don't do lists' longer and louder than the potty mouth of Kevin 07.

Only go to this joint if you've had a full frontal lobotomy and want to make yourself miserable and broke.

Strictly a place for the suckers.


N'uff said.

Uncle Jack

Person's Name : Bianca

Establishment : Golden Apple

Date of Visit : March 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 169 Victoria St, Potts Point, NSW - www.thegoldenapple.com.au

Hours of Business : Not sure

Rates : $280/45 mins (which is the slightly higher rate for Fri/Sat nights)

Age : mid to late 20s

Size/shape : Size 8 / B cup (I think)

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian caucasian

Services Provided : FS, BJ, DATY, DFK

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 


Golden Apple is a fairly upmarket establishment, with prices to match, but in short, it was absolutely worth it! Upon entry, there were two ladies at a reception counter. The older lady (presumably the madam of GA) explained the prices; half is paid upfront at reception, the other half is given to your chosen lady once you're in the room. I had no problem with that. 

I was then led into the bar area, offered a drink (at no cost) and then the ladies came in one by one and introduced themselves. About 8 ladies were available and I have to say, all of them were gorgeous. Seriously, I would have been happy with any one of them! And they conducted themselves very well, they were all polite, no rudeness or bad vibes of any kind. The only awkwardness was in the fact that I was in a room full of hot women, but the two who were sitting on either side of me dominated the conversation, simply because they were physically closer. The others occasionally tried to join in the conversation but it was a bit awkward, because they were just that little bit further away from me. (I believe you can ask for the intros to happen in a private room, one by one, if you prefer.) In the end, I decided on Bianca, who was one of the two ladies sitting closest to me. 

In short, Bianca was stunning. She had a beautiful face, medium length brown hair, a slim but shapely body, was easy to talk to and made me feel relaxed. She led me upstairs to a room which was clean, well-appointed and absolutely huge. After fixing up the financials and a quick shower, Bianca asked me "What do you like to do?" I took this to mean 'extras' so I tentatively said "mutual oral" and "kissing". She said "That's fine" to both of these. No additional charge was asked for. Bianca said the only thing she didn't do was anal, which was fine with me.

I won't go into blow-by-blow details. I'll just sum it up by saying that the session was truly fantastic! Bianca proved to be every bit as sensual as she looked. Everything flowed smoothly, with no sense of rushing, and with the sexual intensity gradually building as the session progressed. Bianca was a great kisser and, to be honest, gave me one of the best BJs I've ever had. Frankly, I couldn't have asked for much more. I left feeling very happy!

@Anon. At those prices you could of and should of taken up a cheaper option IMHO.  That's crazy money to spend on a chick. Granted you had a good time yet there are many options in the area to choose from.

@hushabomb15. Sure, there are cheaper options. And being something of a tight arse, most times I would choose a cheaper option. But every now and then it just feels good not to be a tight arse.

$280 for 45 minutes probably isn't that expensive for a non asian shop in that area of town, You will find the Asian shops or at least some of them a lot cheaper.

I havent been to a non Asian shop for years was thinking of having a splurge again I notice $240 for the hour at my old stomping ground Casablanca at Liverpool

Will have to chech out the cost at the Penthouse.

You will not find many reports on these shops on this forum as they are mostly Asian shops on here.

Used to be a great establishment in the late 90s, then they introduced a system where you had to pay something like a $100 non-refundable deposit just to get in the door. Took my business elsewhere after that.

Establishment : The New Golden Apple (169 Victoria St, Potts Point, Sydney)
Date of Visit : 14 July 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Sydney's Golden Apple - Sydney's Leading Brothel & Escort Agency

Hours of Business : 24 hours

Rates : $200 for 30 mins, $370 for 60 mins, $500 for 90 mins, $600 for 120 mins

Services Provided : Full service

Value for money/recommend? : Not any more.

I visit Sydney about once a month, and invariably treat myself to some fun while there. Some years ago I had an unpleasant visit to the (old) Golden Apple, and never returned. When I heard last year that it had been taken over by the owner of my favourite establishment (Liaisons), I went back for a repeat visit, and was pleasantly surprised by the beauty of both the refurbished décor and the girls. Since then I have been a regular visitor, greatly enjoying the company of Stella, Brooke, Kiera and tiny Tiffany.
On my June visit (to Kiera, a gorgeous and very intelligent redhead), I was delighted to be presented with a card saying "Present this card to redeem '50% OFF' your next booking. *Discount not available Friday and Saturday nights. Valid until 18 Jul 2013", which was exactly a month away. Although I was not due to return to Sydney before 18 July, I decided to treat myself for my birthday and travel down there for Sunday 14 July. I wondered whether my discount card might be accepted for a three-hour booking, but was quite prepared for this to be declined (they don't offer a three-hour rate), in which case I would settle for my usual two hours. Unfortunately none of my aforementioned favourite girls were on duty, two having 'left the industry' and the other two being on holiday.
I arrived around 7pm and was greeted by Ray, a friendly receptionist whom I knew from previous visits. Unlike most other NSW establishments, at the New Golden Apple you have to pay a deposit before you get to see the girls. (Although the website has been promising "Profiles of all our ladies" and "Live interactive roster coming soon!" since last year, this has yet to materialise  so unfortunately you have no way of seeing who is available or what they look like prior to paying your money). However, I have never been disappointed before, and paid the minimum $100 (half of a 30-minute booking) without any qualms, reasoning that I could always make up the difference once I had decided on the length of my booking.
Once inside, I was introduced to three young ladies, all of whom were very pretty, but none of whom immediately sparked my interest, though I traded pleasant conversation with a lovely slender young brunette called Scarlett. Ray told me that there would be a further five girls on duty at 9pm; so I decided to come back later. Ray gave me a receipt for my $100, and off I went.

I came back shortly after 9pm to find a different receptionist  Cassie - whom I hadn't met before. I showed her my receipt, and she showed me in. Unfortunately there were only two more new girls, and the receptionist told me that no others were expected. Of those I had met so far, Scarlett seemed the most engaging, and I decided to spend the evening with her. And that's when things started to take a turn for the worse.
On presenting my discount card to Cassie, I was told that it could not be accepted for a three-hour booking (fair enough); nor, indeed, could it be accepted for a two or 1.5-hour booking. It was (so she told me) only valid for 30-, 45- and 60-minute bookings (despite the fact that nowhere does it say this on either the card or Golden Apple's newspaper adverts, which proclaim "50% discount on all bookings every second visit"  my  underlining). Still, one shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth; I quickly figured that if I booked for two hours at $600, and they gave me 50% discount on one hour of that, that would be $450  about the same as I had hoped to pay for a discounted three-hour booking  and still a 25% saving on my usual expenditure.
In fact, Cassie asked me for $485. But not wishing to quibble, I handed over $385 plus my receipt for $100. But no, apparently that was not what she meant. She wanted $485 in addition to the $100 I had previously paid. Her reasoning was that, as I already had a receipt for a deposit on a half-hour booking, I had to pay: (a) the remaining $100 for my half-hour booking; plus (b) a further $200 for another half-hour; plus $185 (being 50% of $370) for the second hour, for a total of $585. 
I confess it took me two goes to understand her reasoning; and I became acutely embarrassed, conscious of lovely Scarlett watching patiently; somehow, haggling over money did not seem like the ideal start to an intimate evening. Once I understood what the receptionist was getting at, I pointed out to her that this was barely any discount at all on the usual $600 two-hour rate - my '50% discount' had suddenly gone from 25% to 2.5%.  This was met with a look of disdain, and an offer to explain it all a third time; along with the comment "I think you must be getting yourself confused  I'm very bright, you know" (I kid you not  that is what she said. While both parts of her statement may have been true, she appeared to be implying that I must be stupid).
At this point my embarrassment and frustration was so severe that my mood for a relaxing evening of intimacy had vanished completely; so, with an apology to the beautiful Scarlett, I told the receptionist that I no longer wished to stay, and took my leave. No sooner had I left, than I remembered my deposit; but when I returned and asked for it back, this was refused. I pointed out that I had not received anything for my $100; but the receptionist told me that the policy of the establishment was not to give refunds under any circumstances, though I was welcome to present my receipt as a credit note for a future visit. I told her (very politely, I hasten to add), that given how the evening was going so far, I wasn't sure I would EVER be back for a future visit. She pointed to some fine print at the bottom of an A4-mounted display on the counter, told me that those were the terms I had agreed to by entering, and that she was not going to argue with me any further; whereupon I gave up and left.
I'd like to point out that no voices were raised, and both the receptionist and (I think) I were polite throughout (apart from the comment I quoted above, where I honestly don't think she realised how rude she was being); I accept her comment that she was only applying the policies set by the establishment. But in that case I can't help feeling that the establishment has swindled me not once, but twice: first of all by parlaying their proudly-advertised 50% discount down to 2.5% through their bizarre arithmetic; and secondly by retaining my $100 deposit in return for nothing but an evening of humiliation.
Now, I hope I am not being too immodest by saying that I am a good customer. I have visited the New Golden Apple six times this year, making two-hour bookings at each visit. I try to make my visits as pleasurable for the young ladies as they invariably do for me  I am in good shape and well-presented, I love giving long, slow (non-sexual) massages, I always bring them a little gift to say thank-you afterwards, and I have never been one to make trouble of any sort. If this is the level of customer service provided to a repeat customer  let alone a new customer  then the establishment must not be surprised if they do not get many repeat customers. 
If you are looking for 'just sex' and don't much mind who you have it with, then I would certainly recommend the New Golden Apple  the premises are sumptuous, and the girls are invariably lovely. Likewise, if you have a 'regular girl' who you know will be on duty, then by all means visit. If, like myself, you like more of a 'girlfriend experience' and want to know what kind of girl you'll be spending the evening with before you lay down hard cash; or if you're a traveller who is unlikely to be returning to Sydney anytime soon; then I recommend you avoid this establishment  there are others that are just as good, without having to risk your money upfront (I can recommend Liaisons, or alternatively Centrefolds or Stiletto  though the latter is a little too 'businesslike' for my taste). I can only imagine that their policy of giving out credit notes instead of returning deposits is designed to get unsatisfied customers to return for future visits; but  for this customer, at least  it will have the opposite effect. I will not be returning again.

You'd actually would have been better off going on the strip or going to Mens Gallery, paying for entry and then taking one of em out back. 

My advice is to not go to the Cross to punt. Though thank God you only lost a little bit and not a lot more

Good on you Count Jim, provided everything said is accurate then you handled yourself like a gentleman in difficult circumstances.  I am sure you will find somewhere that will appreciate your business.  The other alternative is next time you are in Sydney go back there and see if the other receptionist is on and talk to him about it as he might be more reasonable and possibly horrified about how you were treated.

I will never go there under those conditions!

But I can understand why, being at Kingscross, they must be sick and tired of all those half drunk Cross visitors coming through the door with no money or no intention to stay but just to meet the girls !!

A $100 non refundable deposit would have stopped that but obviously will lose some customers as well !!

Just my two cents

Cheers

Regular punters don't go to the tourist strip brothels and parlours. Generally speaking, these places exist for the 'dumb, drunk & racist' brigade catering for Sat night debauchery and other occasional sex tourists. Equally, the WLs in these places tend to be less desirable and require more money to offset the abuse they often have to endure. For regular local punters - and interstate business regulars, the suburbs offer significantly better alternatives.

This is a bit of a generalisation - you can be lucky and have a good experience but overall, avoid the places that appeal to the 'lowest common denominator'. In the case of Kings Cross... there are many obvious reasons to avoid the place.

[COLOR=#333333]Value for money/recommend? : great view but a few drawbacks[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments :

[/COLOR]To start with, this was a novel experience because it's the first time I've ever slept with a girl taller than me and I'm about 6'2. Her legs just go for days and I was hard as a rock just watching her walk up the stairs ahead of me. 

I rocked up at The Golden Apple for some mid-week fun - I was super toey and failed to line up anything from backpage. The Golden Apple tends to be pricey but there is generally a girl there that ticks the boxes. There was also a girl from UK called Sasha but I couldn't take my eyes off Lydia. Unfortunately, in thinking with my dick (although who isn't at that point?) I missed the fact that she does neither DFK or DATY. I'm OK with CBJ since at least you know they're safe but I like to have either one or the other of those two and she told me from the top that they wouldn't be available. Can't claim I wasn't warned. 

Anyway, I had a shower and came out to find her in her lingerie at which point I came over to help her out of it, along with some light kissing and discovered her slightly small breasts. No complaints but they seemed a little out of proportion but I guess if they were larger she probably wouldn't be in that price range. I had her naked and was kicking myself about the lack of DATY on the menu because her shaved snatch looked scrumptious. 

She worked a franger onto me and started a decent CBJ although the covered ones never seem to do that much for me. Her technique was OK if a little bit mechanical. This moved swiftly into her jumping on top into cowgirl which was a lovely sight. Not to say I was bored after 5 minutes of her hard work (she is also very fit, barely looked out of breath!) but I felt like a change and moved into doggy. I worked there for a while but realised I was starting to run short of time so had to finish off a little quicker than I was planning. 

All in all, she's got a smoking hot athletic body but probably not one for the boob men. Her service was hard to fault but it's worth remembering that she does lack a couple of services which was a bit of a downside for me.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes.

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

I realise that the Golden Apple doesn't meet with many previous reviewers approval, but after a few disappointing visits to other budget establishments I thought it was at least worth investigating.  

I paid the front desk for an hour and was taken to a small viewing room and was introduced to about 7 ladies...none of them really made an impression and then in walked Sarah. A stunning young woman with gorgeous red hair and face to match, she lead me up several flights of stairs (if your adverse to stairs then maybe this place isn't for you, not sure if they have a lift for disabled clients). Into the room for the obligatory health check, shower, and then we hoped in the spa where there was plenty of kissing and touching & teasing, this lasted for a while until I took her to the bed and started going down on her. She tasted amazing and after I was done was rewarded with a juicy kiss and a sloppy CBJ with just the right amount of friction. 

I couldn't take much more of this and she lay herself before me. I slid into her her tight pussy, she felt amazing and I must admit that I didn't have it in me to start off slow and started to thrust away with increasing speed. Sarah responded in kind by lifting her hips up to meet me. She looked amazing as I kept thrusting away until I blew. Overall a great experience with a stunningly smart, articulate and talented woman. Highly recommended.

My experience/comments : 

The entry payment is a pain to deal with, but this night at least had some decent women available. They also hand out discount vouchers sometimes.

I paid the front desk for an hour and was taken to a small viewing room and was introduced to about 7 ladies. Kayla, a tall slim brunette white girl had a nice cute girl next door look, but Tyler had a more sexy face so I picked her, even though she seemed a bit more distant. Walking up the stairs with her revealed her tall slim body with a nice curvy ass. 
Once in the room she was very friendly, giving me a big hug and kiss. We made out for a bit before I headed into the shower. After more kissing, both light and deeper tongue kissing, she kissed some of my body. I responded in kind before going down for daty. She was  clean smelling down there so I licked her for a while , which she responded to in a satisfied manner. I sucked and licked her clit faster and faster, with more urgency, until she could handle it no more. She was appreciative and we kissed each other with more fervor. I was very turned on by then so she put on the dom. I was so eager to be inside her that I didn't bother with the bj, I hopped on top for missionary. She was rather wet and slippery inside so it took me a while to finish. 
Afterwards we had a bit of a friendly chat before I headed out the door into the night. I could certainly repeat sometime.

My experience/comments :
I was in Sydney for business and decided to visit the Golden Apple for the 2 girl special.

Was made to feel very welcome and chatted to a number of interesteing girls in the lounge before retreating to the private intro room to discuss services with a little more discretion.

Angie was a standout with her engaging and fun attitude and she picked Indy to work with. 

The one hour was a blur with the two girls paying complete attention and enjoying themselves.  The girls took turns in offering covered BBJ and DATY as well.

Indie had black hair and angie was blonde.

it all started with a quick health check by angie, and a shower where angie joined me much to my pleasure.
went to the room, where angie started off with a quick light massage. While she was focusing on that, indie started playing with my johnny. the girls then put on a nice show for me kissing each other and playing with each other. Soon indie put a dinger in her mouth and rolled in on and jumped on letting her tight pussy work my cock in. She started slow but then worked up till she was going hard. She squatted over me and i was watching her slide up and down on my cock. Switched to reverse cowgirl so I could rub her asshole and see her tight ass moving on me. Very hot!
all this time angie was rubbing her clit infront of my face.
Switched to mish with her legs over my shoulders and i went slow and before too long she was moaning for me to fuck her hard and deep.

The whole time angie is moaning and sucking my tongue and pinching my nipples and im really turned on.

I flipped her in doggie and I'm fucking her hard. I soon let go of my load. These 2 girls know how to please a man and i am looking forward to my next time with these 2 beauties

Date of Visit : July 

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 169 Victoria at Potts point 

Hours of Business : 24hr

Rates : usually $340/hr. $100 discount currently with voucher from paper

Age : early 20's

Size/shape : sz 10, c cup, about 5ft8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian 

Services Provided : FS, CBJ, daty 

Value for money/recommend? : yes

My experience/comments : changed accountants and am paying a lot less tax than last year so decided to splash out a little. Golden apple newspaper ad is offering $100 discount so though I would take the opportunity so check out this joint. The entrance is a little exposed but was buzzed in quickly. There was no mention of a back entrance on the website but went out that way so would go there next time. It's located in Hourigan lane. you have to pay first before you see any of the girls but you only pay the half that house gets. Reception give you a black folder to put the girls half in there to give directly to them.

Website had about 10 girls available but only got to meet 2. Got a drink and headed upstairs to a huge room. Quick health check as standard for a cauc shop and then a shower. Kept the lingerie on to start whilst kissing and slowly got naked as we proceeded to CBJ. CBJ was quite good and kept looking up at me. 
FS started with her on top and after he bj and being with a nice cauc, I didn't last more than 5 min. 
She asked if I minded her smoking before lighting up. Nice to chat to and seems like a nice girl. She initiated round 2. Started much the same and then went through me on top, doggie, reverse cowgirl and her sitting on my lap. She seemed to genuinely enjoy it. Showered and walked me to the door before giving me a kiss goodbye.
Will have to check out more girls her and at Liaisons as I find cauc girls much more attractive so it it worth the extra dollars

Person's Name : Belle C (http://www.thegoldenapple.com.au/wp-...06/Belle_C.jpg)

Establishment : The Golden Apple (Sydney's Golden Apple - Sydney's Leading Brothel & Escort Agency)

Date of Visit : October

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 169 Victoria at Potts point 

Hours of Business : 24hr

Rates : usually $340/hr. 

Age : late 20's

Size/shape : size 10, D cup, about 5ft10

Nationality or Ethnicity: Egyptian / Fijian?

Services Provided : FS, CBJ, Passionate Kissing ($20 extra)

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Had off from work in Oct, and decided to try out this establishment as it seemed to be one of the higher end ones in the kings cross area. Walk in and be offered a drink the lounge area. Because I did not have a booking, I was shown 2 girls, one of whom I've already been with and so I pick this dusky beauty. She has beautiful jet black hair and a very pleasant voice.

Intros out of the way and this big boobed beauty leads me to the room where the deed will be done. She's up front about her services and up sells the passionate kissing add-on for $20. I'm not gonna say no kissing for just $20 extra and we get the mandatory health check & shower out of the way.

She starts off with a CBJ and then asks me if I'd like to return the favour, but with a dental dam on (?!). She goes on to explain how she's sensitive down there and is all about protection, and so I'm intrigued as I've never seen a WL who uses a dental dam and agree to it. The dental dam was pink sheet of sorts and had a weird taste. I was thinking now I know how girls feel when suck on a pecker with a dom on it. We do that for a bit and she doesn't allow any fingers near her pussy or her ass as she's very sensitive.

With the oral out of the way, she changes doms and rides me. She's got a very shapely ass and I love how she rode me CG. We do that for 5 mins and as I feel close to filling up the dom, I ask for doggie and she gladly obliges. I watch myself pound away on the many mirrors in the walls and then fill up the dom pretty quickly.

We lie down and make good conversation about a bunch of stuff I don't remember, and then on to round 2. This time she's too tired for CG and asks me to go mish pretty much right away. I loved banging her while passionately kissing her and cum pretty quickly as well.

After a quick shower, I bid my adieu quite satisfied with the punt.

Person's Name : Pamela 

Establishment : The Golden Apple (Sydney's Golden Apple - Sydney's Leading Brothel & Escort Agency)

Date of Visit : November

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 169 Victoria at Potts point 

Hours of Business : 24hr

Rates : usually $340/hr. 

Age : late 20's

Size/shape : Busty, plump and nice amount of flesh in the right places, blonde short hair

Nationality or Ethnicity: Spanish

Services Provided : FS, CBJ, Passionate Kissing ($20 extra)

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, decent punt

My experience/comments : I loved my previous punt in Oct and so during my off days in November, I went back to the goldenapple to try out some cauc WL. I was cheeky and did not make a booking again, and was shown a very scarce line up consisting of pretty much the same WLs I met last time with the exception of Pamela. I have seen Pamela in the previous line-ups and ignored her as I liked the other WLs better. Given that I'd been with everyone else in by now, I chose Pamela. 

With the pleasantaries out of the way, Pamela leads me up to the room with the view. I go into the shower and Pamela asked me if she'd like me to join. I'm stoked, and tell her to get in. She gave me a nice back rub and then started tugging my cock with some soap. She has massive boobs and I start playing with them and licking the nipples. I also got to soap her up and rub her pussy and ass. We also had little pecks on the lips and I could tell that she wasn't huge on kissing.

Once out of the shower, she helped me dry off using a towel and I returned the favour. I was hugely turned on by this point and my boy was ready to go. Once on the bed, she covered my dick up with a dom and gave a decent BJ. I felt like she was using teeth more than skill, and so I felt kind of turned off by it.

After a while of the unimpressive BJ, I ask her to ride (CG) me. Now she's a slightly bulkier woman than most, and so I was impressed she was able to do it expertly. She got tired of riding after a while and so asked me to go mish on her. She had nice short blonde hair and I was grabbing it and almost flat over her as my lower half was pounding. She was making slight gasps and the looks and sounds of her turned me on again and I emptied my entire left nut inside her.

We chat for a little bit after round 1, and she tells me she's here on a holiday visa and to learn English and does this on the side to make money.

Round 2, and I tell her I want to go doggie this time. She obliged readily and I was so turned on looking at massive boobs dangle when I banged her from behind. She took it so well and her emotions on the mirror threw me over the line even though I'd asked to finish by blowing my load over her boobs. Oh well, another time.

I was disappointed with the blowjob, but happy with the finish so another overall satisfied  punt at the golden apple.

The girls get paid the same whether the discount is used or not so it shouldn't. I still got a spa room and offered a drink when I went with the discount. The shop takes the hit with the discount but still get $70.

Person's Name : Celine

Establishment : Golden Apple

Date of Visit : May 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 169 Victoria Road, Potts Point - (02) 9357 2555

Hours of Business : 24 hours

Rates : 280/45min

Age : 22

Size/shape : 8 ... Athletic with natural B cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Swedish

Services Provided : cbj, fs

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, but lots of other fish in the pond

My experience/comments : 

I rocked up to the Golden Apple towards the end of the day shift, where apparently there were four girls on. Only two were available. I met Petra and Celine. Petra seemed nice, but Celine had the better body and was more engaging. 

As we walked up the stairs, I stared at her extremely well toned arse, and I was happy with my choice.

Celine has-been in Australia for three years, her English is flawless and she's going to leave for home later this year.

After a quick health check, I had a quick shower. I went onto the bed and there as a bit of awkward interaction as we both waited for the other to lead. 

Celine began by rubbing some lotion onto my cock and stroking me. I asked to to suck me so the dom went on and she began a decent effort so I was hard. I pulled her into a 69 position and began DATY. 

After applying some lube, she sat on my dick and started riding me. I then flipped her over and started doggy. The mirrors in the room were great for this, and I had a great view of her body. I then pushed her down into prone where I came. 

We then chatted for the rest of the session. 

Overall, liked her body and personality. But lack of LFK/DFK and that need to please mean I'll probably try someone new next time.

Age : 22

Size/shape : 1.70cm

Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie 

Services Provided :  BJ, DATY kissing, FS

Value for money/recommend? : Not really, At least not for me

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

I was with a friend near to Town hall and after a couple of drink I decide went to Penthouse I saw some girls but none of them caught my attention, I drunk two beers and then  I went to "The Golden Apple". At that moment I did not remember that I had been there before and I thought: "Wow have to pay first to see the girls and after choose one?" No  thanks. But that day was different because I was a little drunk  and I had already said that I wanted to be in the best brotheles in sydney and leave my reviews here.

I paid 300aud per 45 minutes, after the receptionist give a discount voucher and I waited in front of the bar... 4 girls talked a bit with me and after arrived other guy and they talked with him too (I was waiting more girls). After a few minutes the guy choose a girl and other girl says: You need to choose one, and then I choose Blair becasuse I liked her beautiful face and her stuning eyes, she is very thin.

She said follow me, and I did. After I started to kiss her in the mouth in her body, and after I thought that she would take a shower; I was waiting that because she had a bad smell in the armpits and I don't like that :/  she said no because she did not want to wet his hair.

After she give me a blow job with condom after I start to eath her pussy maybe for 5 minutes, I continued with missionary, cowgirl, doggy style, more kisses in her mouth, doggy style... and others, I remember that she told me that by having her big dick I should be a gentleman and yes I did. Then she said we had to finish it was time... I remembered that when I entered the room I set the time and my alarm had not yet sounded. I saw my phone and still have 10 minutes!! I told her and she said that we need to finish now... I answered ok just let me finish fast, with that I almost couldn't finish... when I finally finished I thought she would take my condom off and she would throw it away and clean me like we usually do Asian but she didn't was bad... for me... I was a bit shocked.

During ASP she did not move much maybe she was tiredI, I arrived almost 3:30am. was good but I did not liked... Maybe I'll go again because I have a discount voucher  but this time I will choose another different girl. BTW I still practice my English but I try to do my best, I will keep posting my other reviews that I have not posted yet.

Well I had previously reviewed this place recently and I had written that I had not had such a good experience for the price that I paid, however they give a discount vaucher that if that if I didin't used it soon, I would be lost this vaucher, so I decided used. I don't like make an appointments with girls that I didn't see before her face... but I had to. As I said in my last review I like the good and deep kisses and my las girl in that place she was not a good kisser, so I chose Chantelle because she is french and I thought it would be a good kisser, and I was not wrong.

When arrived around 5pm she received me with a big smile, she has a pretty face but big teeth. I started a conversation with her, after a good kisses, we took a shower , a drink, a CBJ , a good french kisses again, doggy, FIV, FOV, Mish,. Reverse cowgirl , she came several timesthe time was running out so I decided cum in the position "Belly Flop or cowboy"  I don't know the name of that position...

That was amazing, at the end of the session she told me that I should get a girlfriend because, Because I really like sex and I'm a good lover, I just smiled and said: it's complicated hahaha.

  This is the special water massage bed I am talking about, you can either have a massage on it or fuck on it !!  No extra charge apparently if you have a one hr session !!





















It's one of it's kind in Sydney................ They had this specially imported from overseas !!


I would have tried it long time ago, I just couldn't get me hair all wet, and I couldn't think of a way when the water is going everywhere that my hair could remain dry !!


Will be some body to body or fucking experiences under all those water jets !!


Any one ??

Just put a magnum condom over your head or maybe a shower cap. Nothing says 'sexy' like a shower cap.

I do not like what looks like UV lights up the top; a good way to get skin cancer!

This shop used to be CBJ standard but the last couple of reviews both mentioned BBBJ ! May be they have upgraded the services !

Can any other brother confirm this ??

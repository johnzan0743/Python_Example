Took my myself of to No 1 the other night night and was reminded of the venues that I have visited  in China and the Philippines.
I am not sure about the idea of viewing from a one way mirror  but what I can say is that the W L's here were of a high standard and much more appealing that a visit around the corner at Kyoto.
I chose a lady not because of price (they have 3 price points that are clearly based on appearance but I am not sure if it's correlated to performance. I chose her because she looked Malaysian or Philippine and I wanted a little conversation along with my BBBJ.
Shown up to a clean room with mirrors on the ceiling and I must amit that with no mirrors on the ceiling at home this was a novel thing.
Into the shower with a nice touch up and she joined me to help wash away the grime. She got her hair wet as she knelt in the shower but I figured that was ok. 
My only regret was that I don't remember her name but she was the only Malaysian ( from Singapore) girl there and she has lovely dark skin.
Excellent BBBJ 9/10 (would've been 10 if CIM)
Communication 9/10   
Looks 7/10
Value 8/10
Overall a good venue but I do like talking to the girls before I choose.

I had posted this on another board 2 weeks ago.

The main contact now is mobile 0416 686116 (manageress is Elaine).

Prices used to be:
   30 mins $120
   45 mins $170
   60 mins $200
Just had half an hour, now up to $130.

The "goldfish bowl" runway starts at 6pm, same price I believe.

But less girls on now - when I arrived two Sing/Malays (#5 and #9), I think another was busy, and a Korean. Elaine didn't expect any more after 6pm.

The girl I saw this afternoon was a Malaysian Chinese Stephanie (#5). Only been here 4 days.

She is 21-ish, very slim sz 6, A cup, about 5'4", long black hair. Reasonable English, here to study Engllish then IT for 2 years. Going home to KL for hols for Chinese New Year from 14 February (Kong He Fat Choy!).

We showered, then she started the clock once we were on the bed. Had cat bath down the back and the standard rimming and Dragon Drill - she was good, so let it continue for a good 10 minutes with her also checking the prostate. I then did some anal play with her, 1 finger in her ass, then 2, then with lube got 3 in. Her pussy was dripping by this stage, so had a bid of Double digital Penetration.

Over for BBBJ, then dommed up for CG, reverse CG with more anal play, and finished in mish.

Overall a good session, pretty girl about 7/10 looks, sex 8/10. I would see her again.

Well am back in Sydney, so off to 1 Blackburn. Seven girls were on:
"Singaporean" ( they really all are Malaysian Chinese, or a mix if you're lucky)
#5 Tiffany 
#13 Wendy
#88 Annie (she was busy)

Korean
#7 missed her name
#10 Shany
#17 Irene
#26 Sophia

Current prices are:
30 mins $130
45 mins $170
60 mins $200

I normally go one of the Chinese or mix girls here, but nothing startling in the line-up - and now the Korean girls are outnumbering them.    So chose Sophia, attractive enough, but I loved the lingerie!! (WTF?? it comes off straight away anyway!)

Sophia 5'6", 24, 6.5/10 I would say on the International Attractiveness Scale, she's been here 2 weeks on a 1-year stay. She says all the girls live together in an apartment nearby, Chinese girls in one bedroom, Koreans in another.

Shower, bit of BBBJ in the shower. Onto the bed on my front, as the Chinese girls always do a back catbath and rimming/DD for as long as you like. Duh!! This girl is a Korean - they don't go in for that. So rolled over onto the back and she does nipple play and BBBJ. Good deep throat action and licking of balls, so stuck with this for a while. No anal play from her, and each time I tried to touch her anal passage it was a giggling rejection of being ticklish. Well ok, can live with that, so now into more conventional sexual intercourse action.

Now as she was about to dom me up, I asked her to put the lingerie top back on - black and red corset top thing with the suspender straps. Call me kinky, but I like it. So into cowgirl, good enough fit, not too tight, not too slack, just right, A bit of overdoing on the noise (maybe she realised may hearing disability!!) but it was ok and felt good. Got her to turn around for RC but still didn't want any anal play.

I was in the groove, so kept going, then into mish. Again was able to go for a while, got her legs right up and felt good, and she apparently came. Well, I know I definitely did.

Reasonable enough session - 7/10 on the scale of things. But I do prefer the Malayasian girls here (especially a mix) for the standard rim session.

Saw Irene here a few days ago as she was the best looking in the line-up. Virtually no English. But really a rude unfriendly starfish who makes you feel uncomfortable throughout. Did the deed but it was so hard to actually get into it as there was no participation on her part at all. I am sure she would get picked all the time based on her looks but I doubt that she would get any repeat bookings. I also wonder if any guys would just give up and complain requiring their money back.

Fox, do you mean there are no Koreans here anymore?  
That would be good, as the all active full-on service is from the Malaysian girls. I would rather just see them here - and if anyone wants to see Koreans they can go to ACE 359. 
Having the Koreans here has just cut down on the selection of the Malaysian/Singaporean girls.

I have just been to No1 tonight and I made the mistake of going Korean.
On the maitre d's recommendation, I went for Coco.
What a disappointment for $140/half hour
I assumed No 1 had a standard service of rimming and BBBJ to completion if desired.
Coco provided no assisted shower, no ball licking, a half hearted BBBJ for 2 minutes, then continued sucking for another 2 minutes with a rubber.
Then she jumped on cowgirl for another 2 minutes before saying she wanted another position.
I told her I just wanted a blow job without condom to which she replied that it would not be with me cumming in her mouth.
I was glad to just get it over with.

There were 3 Japanese, 3 Korean and 1 Singaporean on duty tonight.
I should have walked.

Body 7
BBBJ 6

They had a Coco here some time ago who was terrific. Obviously a different one. Yes, I agree, don't go with the Korean girls. In fact Mammasan has told me here that they are a pain in the neck and they are aware that they provide poor service. I suppose it's all about supply and there must be some demand. Singaporean is the way to go but unfortunately at the moment they are simply not as attractive of the walk through and would not get picked as much.

The normal mamasan (Irene?) wasn't there on my last visit - so I was unable to talk with her about the new set-up. I won't see Koreans again here, as they don't provide the normal bbbj and rimming service, and can tend to be starfishes.  I hope management can reactivate their supply line of Malaysian/Singaporean cuties.

Yes Houses, I remember that Coco, she was darkish Malaysian from KL or Ipoh. I think she was #5 then (late last year, early this year). Her real name was Ainee.

No. 1 Blackburn St.#91

Ethnic: Malaysian Chinese
Body: Tiny, Small wrist, Small breast 5.5/10
Hair: waist length
face: cuteness of malaysian chicks 7/10
tats: left upper arm, back neck
Communication: a bit malaysian accent mix with Hokkenese and english and a bit cantonese

This is my first time to have sex with girls and the 1st report i write. My colleagues in the workplace encourage me to go banging. So i decided to go to give out my virgin. After wandering around the city, i finally choose No.1 Blackburn St. As i went inside the house, the mamasan shown 5 chicks for me and my fd to choose. I was orginally expected those chicks would have really a big tits to grab. But most of them have normal tits. As my fd give me to decide 1st. I decide to choose #91. Becoz at that time i think she would be easily for me to screw and handle. My fd chose Jess#99. 

We have a short shower, and during the whole service we try to communicate each other with a bit cantonese and english; but i found she wasn't good to pronounce some words. She shower quickly becoz she complaint about the weather in Sydney and she got cold during the stay.

After shower, she gave me a short blow, then she put the dom for me, and we start rolling out. She suggest me to start with missionary postion, so i go with that. During the whole service i changed my postion 5 times. Half leg, doggy, cow girl............ Hers groaning wasnt good enough. I didn't rest much during the fxxking, however she knows the timing for the serivce (45min), she gave me few HJ to make cumming faster, and then........... i gave up in missionary! And the times up after few mins of my cum. I was been expected to leave at that time, but she decide to gave me a after shower since she know i am a newbie!

After i went back to the lobby, the big boss told me' boy you were over time, but seems u are amazing on the gals!'   My fd was already waiting in the lobby for 15 mins, lol they thought me i was sceewing over 30 mins. But actually the time we spend for chatting was more than 10 mins.

During the dinner with my fd, he commented me" u are really Superman!" 



Overall rate: 6.5/10, standard but not really bad service.( The main problem is the chick have a bit cold during the day, and during the fxxking, she cough 4 times. Thats a bit demirits for her)
Services:

Value for money/recommend ?

There are subtle facial differences if you look at them enough, but the easiest way is to ask.  The girls will not take offence, but rather if you ask nicely will see it as interest in them as human being s rather than as a commodity.

This is part of building a relationship with them.

IF you want to keep using Asian venues, I suggest that you learn to say at least "hello" and "Thank you" in Chinese and Korean.  It gets a surprisingly good result.

Good luck.

Agree with Chalk010: showing an interest in the ladies and working towards building some rapport with them really makes a difference. Someone with a bit of experience can tell Chinese vs Korean vs Japanese by sight, but there's nothing wrong with asking. And yes, learning a few words in their language is also a small but much-appreciated courtesy.

I have a much simpler technique. There is a list in a plastic sleeve on the counter directly in front of you as you look at the walkway where the girls parade. It has sub-headings. The sub-headings state: Malaysian; Singapore; Korean. Under each heading is the list of the names of the girls.....Now children...when the girls names are called out as they parade, just look down at the list to see which country the lady comes from. (Now this is with tongue in cheek so don't get uppity in replies please)

If you have a frank talk with the Mammasan or pappasan - a nice young fellow...they will always tell you that you should avoid the Korean girls. This is simply because they all provide a very automotated service. Yes you might get BBBJ's but ...up and down it goes...yes you get sex...and in and out it goes...just don't touch the make up and keep your hands away from the apple isle and all will be fine....well at least...efficient......get my drift??

Hi Houses, I thought it was only me and the K-Girls.
Bit disconcerting when you are going hell for leather and they have got their heads propped up against the bedhead - wall so their hair doesn't get messed up.
I think they would wear surgical gloves if they could when they give HJ. "I do believe I have to touch the beastly thing!!!
Ho Hum... cum cause I'm getting a cramp in my arm. 
LOL

Not only here but also in HK. Paid a lot of money to have one come back to the hotel with me expecting an overnight stay. Once the deed was done she was off like a shot.... "have to get up early tomorrow to go to mass" LOL

Wow I must be lucky. Have had some average experiences with the koreans I must admit. However I go to Nadira regularly because I know some girls there who love to DFK, allow pussy play and deep fingering and are quite happy to let me pound the hell out of them in any position for as long as I want and never order me around. They love to cuddle, chat and have a laugh if their english is up to it and one girl in particular who I know as Sue (e-cup breasts) seems to adore my company and always tells me about her day and what she has been up to. We connect so well that I always ask her why she smiles so much when we fuck, but she assures me that it is unusual for her - apparently she just loves the way we combine in the sack. And she gives a brilliant massage, showing some almost professional technique. Does she lie to me to get a repeat visit? It's possible. But I'm a pretty good judge of character and have experienced enough of the mechanical ones to know the difference.
So I wouldn't write off the K-girls completely, maybe they are just a bit more picky.

Well, I was back in town on Friday night, and No.1 was a convenient port of call.

It's all changed. Maybe because it's Ramadan a lot of the Malaysian girls have gone home for the holidays, but premium time on a Friday night there were 3 Koreans, 1 Jap and 1 Singaporean.

There was no goldfish bowl, as the predominant Koreans have taken over that area, and evidently they don't think that premodonna-starfishes (who didn't have displayed numbers) don't have to strut the stage. As expressed before, I didn't opt for the Koreans but took the Singaporean. Also this place must have changed hands again, as there was no mamasan and no contact on the 0416 686 116 number.

Singaporean girl was Wendy (#13). pretty, small sz 6, but no ass, definitely A-cups, but a pleasant face and surprisingly her light brown hair did suit.

Normal No.1 procedure. Into room, she showers with you, soaps up the crack very well and bit of BBBJ in shower. Onto bed for catbath of the back, then sustained rimming, which I was happy to let continue. Roll over for an excellent BBBJ - plenty of DT of about 2/3 of the shaft with a lot of slurping sound, which I found to be excellent. Finally I thought better get the full VFM with:
CG (she lay on top to start but I got her to sit up), then 
RCG (but no anal play at all, she says it tickles!!, and also it's a small flat type bum, no round booty here) and then 
 into mish (but didn't want her legs up high over the shoulders, but wanted me to lift her body off the bed, it was quite ok). Kept going and rammed it home and was quite happy and I think she appeared to enjoy it.

Back into the shower when her 30-minute alarm went off (I checked this against my watch, and it was a full session).  Not hurried as she cleaned up the room, and out of there.

DATY - didn't do, don't often with a WL
Rimming - great, love the Malaysian and Singaporean girls, 8/10
BBBJ - pretty good 8/10 (would be more if she could take full length)
FS - energetic and entusiastic 8/10 (no anal play on her)

I guess that comes out at 8 + 8 + 8 / 3, oh about 8/10. Would see her again, but hope for more choice of Malaysians or Singaporeans next visit.

She kindna closed her eyes the whole time and lay down like a dead fish....what a pity for GFE. I wouldnt recommend for bro's who wants GFE from her...The only time she open her eyes was to ask me . you cum ?? i said no and continue for a few mins. was pretty hard to cum for a girl with that attitude.

I went past 1 Blackburn at the weekend (for old times' sake) to see what is occurring. The operation moved as reported up to ATOC in Riley St. The premises in Blackburn have been gutted, and from what I could see through the security roller, is now just one big room. This has been a slow and major renovation, so I would doubt a new WL extablishment will go in there.

It is a shame, as 1 Blackburn provided the only catwalk ("fishbowl") type experience in Sydney.

The 1 Blackburn business has moved to the old A Touch of Class location at 377 Riley St, and Jasmines (the massage place that was in the same building - off the Foster St frontage) has moved to 375 Riley next door. Don't know if they still have the same catwalk/fishbowl type of setup. I believe ATOC occupied both buildings.

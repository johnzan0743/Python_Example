 380 Pitt St, Sydney - 02 XXXX XXXX
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Sara!

 Establishment : 380 Pitt St

 Date of Visit : Aug 2014

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 380 Pitt St Sydney

 Hours of Business : Unknown

 Rates : $160 hour for "Korean" massage, discounted to $145

 Age : 30-ish

 Size/shape : Tall (sat 173cm) size 10

 Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian - probably Thai

 Services Provided : Nude Massage, Body Slide, Tug

Recommended: yes as long as the price is right.

With a gap between client and airport, and a flat phone, Toad sought a massage in an area known to have available options.  Ducked into the first available at 380 Pitt St and a brief chat with mamasan resulted in agreement on the Korean offer, with discount.  Seems like things were a little quiet, though at the nominal $160 the offer was also too expensive.

Up to the room and off with the gear.  In comes tall Sara, who quickly strips off to nickers and begins the massage, which was actually quite good.

After a decent working of back and leg muscles, she oils up heavily and begins the body slide, which is really just a titty rub.  Then the flip and a little cursory rub on the front before she lines up opposite Toad's Tool looking ready for the main event.  At this stage I comment that its supposed to be  a nude massage but she still has nickers on.  She says she will take them off so I can look, but I am not allowed to touch.  OK - slightly disappointing but I guess digital invasion was not on the menu so I agree.  Really not much value in the visual, as it almost immediately disappears against the table.  

The main event comprised a good unrushed sensual and comprehensive working of the little chap, accompanied by plenty of sack tickle.  It feels great and she brings me right up to the edge, but can't seem to get me over.  The problem as sometimes happens is that she is not working the right place on the shaft, and there is no option but to lend a hand.  To her credit, she accepts the help and continues her work as well - Toad working the lower end of the shaft while she strokes the head and nuts.  Her reward moments later is a powerful dam burst that coats her hand and elicits a cute giggle - she seems a bit surprised by this older guy's power.

Thank you for your review Toad.

Does this establishment have  "Korean Massage" on a sign or similar ?

"City Massage" is at 382 Pitt St. Any chance of it being that one ?

Google Maps to the rescue. 380 is actually City Massage 382A is the 24 Hour Book by the Hour Hotel - The massage place actually has a Relaxing Massage sign with Massage in Green.

Looking at the window over the door while exiting saw the number 380.  Big massage sign out front.

The menu was stuck on the wall at "reception".  Korean massage was top of the list.  There was also "European" and regular.  Not sure what the differences were.

Estudio needs a revamp. I was horny one night last month. Tried my luck for the first time none of the girls were half decent. Was hoping my beer goggles would work alas no dice. Was warned by a friend to not have high hopes. Oh well...gotta try.

Maybe the better ones were busy, so I will give the benefit of the doubt. Not many choices at night.

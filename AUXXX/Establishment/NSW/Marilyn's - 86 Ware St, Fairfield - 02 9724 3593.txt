Hi, I'm new here and this is my first review.

A few months ago I went to a well established establishment in the Fairfield, NSW area called Marilyns.

The service I recieved was excellent. I was given a choice of three girls, and chose a voluptuous, New Zealand girl called Coco. After taking a shower, she treated me to a nice back massage and a chat, and made me feel at ease. She enjoyed kissing, and I played with her breasts for a while. She went down on me and gave me an extremely sensual blowjob until I came. 

Highly recommended, I would return again

No wonder it is closed.  "Marilyn's" doesn't quite do it for me as a business name for a Brothel.  Yes Marilyn Monroe was an exquisite lady but for some reason this name for a brothel just makes me think of an old clapped out hooker with way too much makeup, bright red lipstick and a cigarette loosely hanging out of the mouth. Same goes for Madonna's.

I suspect it was closed for a while. This news story indicates the owners were charged with keeping girls under conditions of sex slavery. http://www.fairfieldchampion.com.au/...es/196088.aspx

They were convicted and sentenced to 11 or 12 years. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/new...-1111117342118

It appears they are now appealing the conviction. http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sydney-cou...0510-uofm.html

A Google search on the woman's name will yield much more background information.

However, our colleague punter says he saw a Kiwi girl there so I am thinking there is new ownership and management.

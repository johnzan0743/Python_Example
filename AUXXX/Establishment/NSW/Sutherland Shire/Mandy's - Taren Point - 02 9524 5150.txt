Just curious to see if anyone's been to Mandy's at taren point. Prices seem a tad high, but if the girls are hot might be worthwhile. So I'm hoping for some feedback before my first visit. Cheers

Operates out of a factory in Parraweena Road.....they also do an outcall service as well.....
Usually staffed by young caucasion girls hence the prices.....

Has been on the Shire scene for quite some time. Ladies, all Caucasian, aged in early twenties to early thirties. Definitely a very straight service, no bbbj, no anal, no cob. Some very fine looking girls but, for the price, better service can be had elsewhere.

I've heard otherwise, that they are the usual average, older white chicks that are common in cheapish caucasian places (compared to higher class joints)  I guess you could get a gem though.  My intel could be mistaken too, but I doubt it.  

Mandys is also a non-council approved establishment recently knocked back under appeal for their approval so are still an illegal joint which is why they don't openly advertise address etc and only open after hours.

It would be nice to hear a good report, I might eat some white meat myself!

jilamint is quite correct. The council has refused approval on a number of times. Although the premises are located in an industrial area there are concerns about suitability of the premises and parking. That is why Mandy operates mainly after hours and pushes her outcall services. The ladies I referred to were working there at beginning of last year. Staff may have changed in the meantime.

Its places like this that could do with some reports on here from punters but I guess if its not legal then thats a problem.

Went here last Saturday night on my way home from dinner. Couldnt be bothered going out of the way.

Two ladies available one horror, Saw a lady named Erika, Black bob hairstyle around 6ft tall, slim, smallish tits around 40 yrs old. Little disappointing in the CBJ department- lasted all of about 10 seconds i kid you not! Never mind she made up for it in the fucking department, just one of those cases where the sex out weighs the headjob. Finished up in about 25 mins she then went on to tell me it was only her second shift ever as a W/L, im pretty sure she wasnt lying. I would see her again but wouldn't go looking.

Anyway the place is clean and tidy but cold as the rooms are very large, the receptionists are pretty ordinary and really make you feel like they are doing you a favour by being there. For 170 per half hour i prefer to drive to Amandas or Riverwood.

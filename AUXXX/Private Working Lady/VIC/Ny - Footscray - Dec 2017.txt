My experience/comments : 
I was off for a last minute shop for a new years party and was  wanting some female attention. I popped in one of my locals in Footscray  and was soon introduced to Ny. She was a very good looking lady and was  about 5'3 size 6 with long dark hair. I helped her out of her dress to  see the most amazing set of breasts with long nipples begging for  attention. 



I asked her if I could massage her and  she welcomes that. While massaging her I soon realised that she didn't  have any fat on her body and all and she felt great. I soon turned her  over and gave her breasts the attention they were asking for.



Shortly  afterwards I lied on my back and she proceeded to give me a CBJ and I  asked her to jump on top.She was very tight and I wanted to give her  some doggy since I was in the doggy land and pounded her hard which she  seemed to enjoy,



WIR yes

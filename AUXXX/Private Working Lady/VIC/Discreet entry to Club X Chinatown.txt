 Discreet entry to Club X Chinatown

If you would prefer to not be potentially spotted turning into Coverlid lane to go to the Club X then do this
Go to Russell street and go in the car park between Bourke and Little Bourke streets

Walk to the far right and you will see some metal stairs on your right close to the end
Go up one level

Walk to your left and you will see the lane one level down, there is a door and stairs on your right which you can use to go back down one level
Using these stairs go out the door on the next level down and the lane is on your right

Now the Club X is just a few meters away on your right

Because the door from the car park is recessed you can even glance out if you like
Now go and enjoy those shows, peeps and privates without a worry of being seen

Nationality or Ethnicity : Claimed PRC, looked more Japanese to me.

Services Provided : FS, CBJ

Value for money/recommend? : No / no

My experience/comments : 

Booked a girl called Chika. Rocked up, no Chika, but Cookie seemed to be both personable and visually compliant (similar to Chika) so I said sure why not.

What a mistake.

First of all, the intercom didn't work, so we had a strange 10 minute dance trying to get in, but that's the fault of the building.

Insisted I have a shower (fair enough) and she spent the entire time trying to upsell me to a double. I declined due to insufficient funds. Get into the bedroom, take off clothes, all good so far. Then I find out that DATY is extra $50. Do I really have to give you a CBJ? I'd rather not. BBBJ I prefer, as I don't like the taste of condoms, but that will cost you an extra $50. No go, I say. Half way through the CBJ, so sorry I need to do a wee wee. Off she trots. Comes back 5 minutes later. Spends some time cleaning her self, then finally we get to the main course. You're too big, I don't like this position.

I'm sure most of you have been through it before, so I will not go on.

In short: avoid.

Dean.

All too often backpage disappoints, especially at the lower price end ... recently have been sticking to the upper end or simply giving BP a miss altogether.   Sometimes though I just can't believe it's not true and get sucked back in for one more go lol

The odd one pops up.

I'm usually OK at picking the groups; there's one address I won't go near any more, but this one did slip through...

i booked a girl called Anna for a nuru full service $250 1hr. Supposed to be Korean. The woman who answered the door was in her late 30s maybe 40s and Chinese. She rushed me into bed and was not very sexy. Quick cbj then condom mish. Finished in about twenty minutes and hustled out the door. I normally do well with wls but I've had two bad experiences lately! Be wary of this place! Lots of girls advertise for the box hill area but I have no idea who's real and who's not. Even the pic that she sent via sms was a different girl. Be wary.

Thats not what the dislike button is for. Its for when you dont like the members post, not for when you dont like what happened to him. Disliking a members post affects his reputation points, so its not fair to the poster to use it for that.

Looking thru backpage etc, I think the same crowd are working in Carnegie and Brighton. Similar pics, descriptions and phone numbers.  They're getting big. But still switching girls.

This "outfit"  are actually all over Melbourne at the moment. Box Hill,  Glen Waverley,  Carnegie,  and I didn't know this until today,  but even in the city as well. Generally,  the $250/hr ads you see on Locanto and backpage,  it's this crew. They fly girls in from O.S  and then fly them round the  country for a few weeks. Not sure if it's all known to the girls before they arrive though. I met one today,  in the city,  and I didn't realise it was this crew until I was already at the apartment block. Girls was great though,  will post a review later.

Which girl was it?

I encourage everyone to walk away if the girl is different from the ad. We have to change that! Just walk away. I have done it!

Sounds like the Sydney $250/hr system has made its way down to Victoria, almost never the same girl as in the photos (if the photos are real at all), always changing locations/numbers/services; pretty much a total gamble every time. Definitely agree with the walking away part, although that's not going to be a message that goes out far across most.

 Another RIP OFF in BoxHill
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Rachael of Switzerland

Establishment : Boxhill / Mont Albert  . Motel

Date of Visit : 15 Nov 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0420967168

Hours of Business : 10am- 9pm ?

Rates : $130 $150   30 mins

Age : 22 Fake

Size/shape :  skinny

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : Full service.

Value for money/recommend? : Fake , not recomended.

My experience/comments : Very  disappointing. As i was in the area i thought i would attempt to try this lovelygirl "Rachael of Switzerland" as advertised with a beautiful photo of her. . I specifically said to them " i will come only if you are the girl in the photo",  they said yes 2000% real,  and texted me another photo of her.   I was suspicious, but thought i would try anyway. They texted the room number in the dodgy hotel, and mmmmm....   a 40 year old Asian opens the door..........oh yeh, just great,   here we go again.  I said you are not from Switzerland ,  she ignored that and says,  "you like, you like"  and tried to drag me in.  I just said , "your not the girl in photo...see ya"  and left. 
Keep away from these guys, it is such a scam.  It seems any of these linked to a motel is a fake these days. Be aware.

My experience/comments :

Text, quick reply, confirmed address as per ad and photos - which proved to have been real most likely
Apartment, new, clean, as per the photos in the ad
I liked her instantly, she seemed happy as well, paid for 30 mins and she said "you handsome, one hour"
I politely refused and that must have been the beginning of the sour end. 
Complaints began about my being too big, some vulgar suggestions, quite rude and unattractive comments - and I thought I liked it that way - but not quite to that extent. 
No bj, straight to the Dom, mish, but blocking me from entering more than an inch - then doggy, but with so much lube that it was like screwing a swimming pool. All along me being nice and very gentle and her answering angrily then pretending she can't speak English. No touching of the boobs allowed either. Eventually gave up, went for a shower, then asked the lady in the living if there was another girl available - she smiled and gestured that she cannot understand. Also heard a male voice earlier on - there was another bedroom - they didn't seem to be working or clients, just friends or bosses perhaps.
Said my goodbyes and politely left. Yoyo seemed embarrassed now, avoiding eye contact, seemingly embarrassed for letting me go like that. A sorry experience like no other.

Reading some of the threads about Sydney by comparison it makes you want to jump on a plane and head there

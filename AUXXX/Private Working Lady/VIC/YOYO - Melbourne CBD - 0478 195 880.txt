Age : late 20's early thirties

Size/shape : slim, nice boobs

Services Provided : F/S

Value for money/recommend? : yes

My experience/comments : text to make a time, got a response.  Walked in - reception ignored me - waited downstairs on the couch while she finished with a punter and then texted me the room number and floor. Walk in and I was pleasantly surprised by her looks and shape - not far from the pictures, but later when I got close to her skin she is much older than 22.  Striped off and she showed a cute body, nice boobs, natural and we lie down on the firm mattress. She starts playing with junior and off we go - condom on and bit of suck and we are ready for business. Just right amount of lube wilt h good feeling.   I am ready for 15 mins of power action so we get into it and I look at my watch just as she says 20 minutes almost up.  I decide now is the time and shoot the load while she is talking dirty with a Chinese accent. Good stuff.  We clean up - I get dressed, she is now already dressed now arranging next punter.  Value for money yes, but not much interplay.  But not any different to the 30min?$130 so a $60 saving gets the job done for me.

I agree these girls are great value at $70 a pop for 20 minutes. FFS I never last 30 minutes in a session anyway so why pay the extra $60?
Well done.

I am now starting to wonder if this city hotel is running the largest hotel brothel in Australia.

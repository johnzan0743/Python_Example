My experience/comments : 

The bad:
1. Short changed on time - Booked one day before, paid in full upon meeting - including extras ($30 for bbbj, $70 for anal)Only got into 40 minutes before she tried to get me to finish.  Guess you get what you paid for?  I certainly didn't.
- BBBJ - Fair enough, $30 isn't much - upon meeting me she outright refused and didn't fulfill the service despite me paying for it.  Instead most she did was gave it a kiss - no blowing.  She wanted condom on - so I didn't bother.  She didn't look friendly when questioned so I thought ill let it go and move onto sex
2.  Sex was good but a bit clinical - only complaint was she was constantly checking time/phone -she doesn't put her phone on silent so when a new message 'dings' - she checks, and one time she had the audacity to even reply - thats after telling me she 'needs a break'.  I can fully understand any 'ding' is a potential booking which equates to $$$.  As long as you respect me as a customer by saying 'Excuse me' or 'Sorry' - then I can relate or understand but she was outright rude/didn't care - just does what she want kind of person like she knew already you won't be coming back so she doesn't care about her standard of service.

TLDR:  Bad service, clinical experience

The good:
1. Responsive
2. Nice looking small pussy
3. Photos sent were slightly retouched but had a good approximate depiction of her - unlike the entirely fake ones that are way too commonplace..   
4.  Priced well

My experience/comments: not my type, too much snorting and too much fluffing around.

ok, had heard about this girl on PP. I decided I'd give her a shot today. Appointment easy to arrange, arrived at her place, nice girl, but too much snorting and make-up. I didn't really feel any connection at all..actually, I just wanted to leave.

pics sent via sms are relatively true but quite old. attractive, not really...gives a good BBBJ and massage but I declined sex and kissing. I just felt off in her presence.
she's not my type..also, lots of acne on back and lots of shaving rash.

glad I didn't really go any further than BJ and massage.

$200 for the hr..I wouldn't return because she's not my type.

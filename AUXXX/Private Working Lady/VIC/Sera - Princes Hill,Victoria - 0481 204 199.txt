My experience/comments : Sera is a private operator. Her ad is perfectly written. Selfies with the phone number are the best you get for non-fake. Searched on 'Sera' on PP and found some positive review spanning a few years. Searched on the mobile number and also found reliable reviews. Booked it in. Easy to arrange with perfect communication. Like previous reviews, photos are accurate. I got to the address 10 minutes early. At 5 min. to time got the text, ready with easy to follow details. Was in the room right on time. Sera is attractive, intelligent and one of the most friendly and natural ML/WL's that I've met over the years. Room was well presented with soft lighting candles, music and clean towel on the bed. Sorted out the financials, into clean bathroom for a shower. Leave the clothes in the bathroom. 'Come out nude'. Lots of warm lomi lomi stuff, not really oil, something else. Face down to start with nice massage, tickling the tackle and body sliding. But, interestingly, it wasn't really doing it for me. It is was nice, but, it didn't have that intensity you get at the better RnT's. I wasn't too fussed and just relaxed and let Sera do what she was clearly very good at doing. Turn over comes. Touching is ok but 'no fingering'. Sera takes you to the edge a few times and knows when to back away. You know it is time when she moves into what you think/hope is going to be 69 position but she stands over you and you can play with the pussy but no tasting while that the same time your post and sack are getting an expert job. The end is inevitable, as it was at the start. If you are into a really nice time with a really nice person, then give it a go. For me, not really my thing. DATY would have been nice. YMMV.

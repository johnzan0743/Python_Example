My experience/comments :
This is a belated review, I saw Lulu last year when I was in Melbourne and was in the mood for a MILF, saw Lulu's ad and she was available that night. Getting in touch with her and organizing the session was easy, but it was the session which didn't live upto expectations. Where do I start, she advertises a gfe, but doesn't offer it during sessions, the massage and BJ was fairly mechanical and half hearted.... and to top it all off, she was a chatterbox.

chatterbox? that DOES sound like a true GFE probably asked you to take the trash out to the bin on your way out!

She is advertising under another name on Cracker as well, Ashley I recall. She has a great body, face etc for a mature lady. I wanted to see her, but she is cold. I understand what you mean about GFE, she thinks its a selling point but doesn't know what it means because she is ice cold to deal with and reading between the lines on her ad, I don't do this, I don't do that, don't ask me this, so many rules, you just know it will be a waste. It's one of those ladies that you go 'nice' but by the end you are looking for the door, never to return.

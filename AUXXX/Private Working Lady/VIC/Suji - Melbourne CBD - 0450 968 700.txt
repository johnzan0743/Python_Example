My experience/comments :

Her english was okay. She provides BBBJ & CIM with this rate. BBBJ was very average. She is also very skinny, I found her too skinny for me. If you like long legs then she is for you. Sex session was okay. she wanted to do 69 but i am not into it. She is very nice girl but this was my first BBBJ experience and did not really enjoy it. Her face is not the best but its still overall a decent session. Only recommend if you like very skinny girls, otherwise I do not think its that great.


Number in title is wrong, I dont know how to change it?

Not sure why you would recommend her considering the actual review was not very good. And $270 for a shit service you talk about above? Too expensive for me even unless the service was absolutely outstanding, and this one obviously wasn't by the sound of it?
But I am sure she will suck many dollars out of many gullible punters.

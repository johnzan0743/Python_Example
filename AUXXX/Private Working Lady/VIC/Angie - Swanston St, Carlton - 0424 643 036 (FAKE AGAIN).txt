 Angie - Swanston St, Carlton - 0424 643 036 (FAKE AGAIN)
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Angie

Establishment : PWL

Date of Visit : early May 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : ?Goddess hot sex ??Do anything you want to - Melbourne escorts - backpage.com.au

Hours of Business : Not sure

Rates : $150 / 0.5h

Age : 40's

Size/shape : Tall, big breasts but had to tell as was wearing loose fitting clothes and I walked

Nationality or Ethnicity : Not sure, maybe Vietnamese but could been Chinese

Services Provided : None as I walked

Value for money/recommend? : No / No

My experience/comments : New approach to Backpage ads: Assume all photos are fake and be ready to walk if WL is not attractive. If they are not on time walk. If they can't communicate in person walk (try discussing services not provided through Google Translator and you will never get a refund). I had asked the WL if the photos were real in the texts and was advised photos real. I guess they are, but just not of her. When I turned around and walked the WL slammed the door. Wastes both our time.

'Like' try the TinEye webpage - it does reverse image searches and is pretty good. Your girl gets about 50 hits on various chinese webpages.

I like this policy, I think I'll start doing it too. I know we're a drop in the ocean, but it might filter a few fakes out

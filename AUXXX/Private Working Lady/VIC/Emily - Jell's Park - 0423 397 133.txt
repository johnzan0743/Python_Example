My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Have had 2 experiences with her so far one @ Waltzing Matalida Hotel & went back for seconds @ Jells Park

Emily stated she got into this work just to raise some funds. Overall the better service was @ the hotel where for the $300 outlay I had full service, DATY and a real girl friend experience.
She only does in car around where she lives somewhere around Syndal station Glen Waverley area

Service is great in the room and worth the punt for in car.
Emily is late 20s and is best to catch her on business days from a varierty of motels in Springvale, Noble Park area - photos in add are accurate

Overpriced but she is a lloker

Contacted her the other day and asked if she had seen me.  I said no and insisted on a pic.  Sent through a selfie and she replied -  no thanks 

Very fussy girl. I guess because I am late 40's she wasn't interested.

OK, seems to ration to previous clients. However there are plenty more fish in the ocean as the saying goes, so go fishing elsewhere.

Those who had strange experiences with her previously
will agree ' buyer beware' she was prone to strange behaviour in the past.

She's fucked up. Threatened to kill herself and thought I was the FBI.

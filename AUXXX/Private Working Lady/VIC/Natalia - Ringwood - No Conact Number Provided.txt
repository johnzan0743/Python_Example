Services Provided : BBBJ/FS 

Value for money/recommend? : Good value and recommended 

My experience/comments : Natalie greets me at the door wrapped in a white towel with her right tit exposed. This gets me in the mood very quickly. She escorts me to the bedroom and asks me to undress. Natalie immediately starts to suck on my cock and even though it a bit toothy it is very enjoyable. I move to the mosh position and slowly slide my cock into her wet creamy pussy. She moans lightly and as I progress it gets louder and louder until the crazy mamasan comes in to make sure all is ok. Natalie smiles and then laughs as the crazy mama leaves. I can't hold out any longer and we both explode together. I take some time to recover and then head for the shower. On leaving Natalie greats me at the door dressed only in a sexy pair of black see through nickers and I start to bar up again. Oh I can't wait th get back next week.

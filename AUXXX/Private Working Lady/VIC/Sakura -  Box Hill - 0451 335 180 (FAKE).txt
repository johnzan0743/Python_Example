Value for money/recommend? : ok / no

My experience/comments : Was heading for a RnT out that way but ML turned out to be not working. Looked for an option. Movie with a card and a number I thought was a good sign. Recall some reviews in a new apartment building and though would give it a punt. Good texts and as the WL couldn't speak much English was someone else somewhere. Door opens, figured it was going to be fake and it was. Couldn't be bothered walking although the WL was uninspiring. Seems to be one of those groups that buy a new apartment and then run a cash business to pay it off, although I don't know how they get the cash into the financial system. Maybe you need to run a massage place to clean it. Or a car parking business like Fargo. Anyhow, all was boring, although ok with DATY so a bit of a surprise. There was another WL in the kitchen when I left and she looked ok but not for me. She said, would you like to come back in a little while. I'm sure the group has a WL that is the girl in the movie, not the photos that are close but clearly fake, and can just switch it around.

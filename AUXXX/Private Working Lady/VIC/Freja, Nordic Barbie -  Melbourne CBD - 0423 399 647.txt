My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

I had been looking forward to a trip to Melbourne for weeks and planned  to see a couple girls I had previously selected online. Arrived in  Melbourne and tried for a couple days to get hold of selected ladies who  unfortunately were not working those days or they did not answer or  respond. Noticed the Nordic Barbie and was blown away by the ad (should  have known it was too good to be true). Booked for the hour and traveled about 20 min to destination, arrived and was greeted by a lady  with fake blonde hair, dark glasses and did not seem to fit the pics at  all. She asked if I wanted to stay and after all the effort I decided  to even though my gut indicated I should have walked. She took off  glasses and had one brown eye and one blue eye, she undressed and all  the flabby bits came out once the tight fitting clothes came off, pear  shaped figure and curvy, she also had a huge swollen bulge (tennis ball  size) above her buttocks. Be warned, this lady is fake, pictures are  fake and poor service provided. I left after 30 minutes, disappointing with money down the drain. I guess you win some and lose some

Actually it happens some times and is a natural but not very common event.

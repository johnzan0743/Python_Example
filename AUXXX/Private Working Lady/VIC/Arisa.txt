My experience/comments  I am now a very infrequent punter but every now and again, I feel the need.  All the feedback said the adds in Ardeer and Sunshine were fake, but no I thought surely they cannot be all that bad.  Any way I was diving along Ballarat Road and thought, it's cheap, it's been a while, why not try.   Stopped the car, sent a MSM and got an instant reply saying where she was, first red flag.  Said I would be there in 10 and was advised a room number of a Motel, second red flag.   Got to the motel, which by the way is on Ballarat Road, all dark, parked and went in search for this room and finally found the right number after wandering around the motel for several minutes, third red flag, but no, I kept going. Walked up to the door and could see though the curtain, this lady sitting at a table and I though, no stunner.

Any way I knocked and this frumpy, plumpy lady came to the door and ushered me in, I should have taken off, no bombshell Singaporean here, but paid accordingly and lets not go into details other than say, not touching, no kissing which I would have passed, no whatever other than a HJ and I thought the quicker this is over the better.  

 Nothing like their BP adds of which there were 14 all for the same phone number.   

In the end I think curiosity got he better of me, but never again.  Heed the red flags.

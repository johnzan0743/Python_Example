My experience/comments : 

Saw an ad on Australs, which is usually pretty good, showing a lovely cuddly Cauc girl called Alice. Prices and services seemed reasonable (ie not too good to be true), and image searches on tineye and google didn't find any duplicates. So I rock up to Like's favourite CBD establishment (not) at 160, and I enter to find a most unappealing and unattractive 50+ Chinese MIRNF. I ask for the girl in the ad (photo was on my phone), no she no work today. Ah, but I texted checking that she she was. Ah no, sorry. The pantomime went on for a bit with this lady contradicting herself, and finally admitting that no, this girl didn't work here. But she was prepared to offer me a discount if I stayed. Oh, what's the discount I ask. 30 mins FS for $120 she says. Hey look, the ad here says standard price with this girl is $100 for 30 mins. 

I reported the ad to Australs as I was leaving the building and five minutes later it was gone. Good work by them.

I walked.

Dean.
PS Here's what was allegedly on offer:

I just went and had a look Dean. never used this site before, good to see you reported them.
I may go and report them myself as a disgruntled punter. What a blatant rip off, worse than most we all know about fake photos etc but this one takes the cake.

I got sucked into thinking I was seeing a European girl.  When the door opened it was a PRC girl with huge tits - my dick said yes.  She really wasn't much of a root, should have walked.

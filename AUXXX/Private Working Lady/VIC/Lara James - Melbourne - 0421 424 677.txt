Lara James

Private - Melbourne

www.officiallysette.com

All details on her website

Value for money - YES

Got her to come to my hotel room, the first thing to strike you when opening the door is she is tall and her pics on her site are very accurate.

We agreed on the services on the phone before so there was no "what would you like". The 2 hours went fantastically well and she was in no hurry to leave.

I will deinitely see Lara again even if it was to suck those magnificent boobs one last time.

Hi Punters

A little bit more on Lara or "Lysette" to give you more of a blow by blow (and there were lots) description.

I took the "pornstar" experience which included BBBJ and rear action for $650. 

Once the pleasantries and business was taken care of we had a glass of wine to settle the mood. Lara smelt divine and her wicked laugh and fingers stroking my leg meant that the wine was quickly forgotten. Before you could say "lets get these pants off" her lips were on me giving a great sloooow BBBJ that said right there and then I was in for some great fun.

My hands wandered and found her boobs which need to be touched to be believed. Although enhanced they are great.

My turn for some play. I got her to stand and slowly slid her dress completely off before sitting her down and enjoying some dining of my own. 

Round one was finished with some covered action in a few different positions ending in reverse cowgirl so I could hold her butt and see every mm.

Back to the wine and some fluid replenishment before she used her oral skills to start round two. I enjoyed these skills for alot longer without fear of over exuberance on my behalf. She is good at this!!!

Finally we covered again for the rear action which is a sight to be seen for yourselves.

I think we went way over time, and we had a good chat after.

Guys, if you are looking for someone that enjoys her time and makes you comfortable straight away, then she is your girl.

Next time I am in Melbourne she will be booked immediately.

Hello

Yes, she sure has a pretty face Lara. I need to save a bit and book her. I would love putting my cock deep in her mouth. Will let you all about it when I save enough cash, unless Guillard give us a tax break... this could help

Tried to book Lysette for this Thursday night. After confirming with me last week for a 2 hour session I thought I'd better reconfim and check... to be told after many unanswered calls and text messages that she's not availble on Thursday, sorry. WTF?

Extremely unprofessional, and a pity as I was really looking forward to it.

She has cancelled on me twice now after confirming, and worse yet 4 hours before the meeting. That's 5 star hotels I've booked for nothing!

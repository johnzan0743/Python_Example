Person's Name : Angela

Establishment : PWL

Date of Visit : early Jan 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : http://melbourne.cracker.com.au/Fema...-real/30719692

Hours of Business : Not sure

Rates : $150/0.5h

Age : mid/late 20's

Size/shape : medium height, long dark hair, small tits but nice, attractive

Nationality or Ethnicity : ad says Singapore which is probably correct

Services Provided : CBJ, DATY, FS

Value for money/recommend? : Yes/Yes

My experience/comments : About one out of three of the ad's on Cracker that I have booked have been fake, and the others if not fake are usually photos that are not recent. Angela's ad has photos with her mobile in the photo. While this could still be fake it is less likely so took the punt and made a booking. Easy texts to arrange time, confirm services and location (William St near Flagstaff Gardens). If you are going to walk you need to walk when they open the door if the photos are fake. Thankfully photos are genuine and recent, and possibly taken in the same apartment. Angela's easy going with a nice personality. Apartment was clean with the bedroom, which opens off the lounge/kitchen, set up with a clean cover. I'd just had a shower so passed on that and no problem. Started off with a CBJ and nice touching. Bit of light on lips brushes. After a bit Angela asked if I wanted to lick her pussy. Yes. DATY time. Shaved with light stubble. Bit of FIV, DATY and then into mish. Then a bit more DATY, then doggy, which was too good and finished that way. Showered and Angela also had a shower afterwards. Angela said she will be there for about a week.

Any chance of BBBJ with Angela, or did she flatly refuse.

My experience/comments : Have been getting ripped off with RnT and B2B so bailed on the massage approach. Have booked through this mob before. Good texts per usual. This is the building just before you go through to Coromandel Pl. An old crew from Coromandel is now at Elizabeth St fake place. Into room, stripped off, started on side of bed, in comes a second girl, not as good looking, offerring a double for an extra $50, had only taken $150 so couldn't, tried to get me to transfer by phone, said don't do electronic, next time, Dora had a good attitude, friendly, no problems, just doing the job, happy for some pussy play, DATY and 69 and fine with eye contact during sex, worked through positions and after doggy drop down and felt the best so finished off like that.

This extra girl for 50 is a new scam they must be running at this place. Lucky you didn't go for it or would have been disappointed like me.

Agree robot the 2 girl thing is a waste of time, in all my years of punting I only tried it once and never again.

My old number from the mob that were in the front building then moved to Coromandel Pl they have now moved to 462 Elizabeth St which I've had 100% fakes and bad ones so declined going there. Others seem to get good outcomes there

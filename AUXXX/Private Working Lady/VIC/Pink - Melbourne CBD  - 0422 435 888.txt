My experience/comments :
Have posted the Adelaide BP link to this WL as she moves around a bit, mostly Brisbane but is in Melbourne a fair bit too which is where I actually saw her.
Number is the same, pics are the same, just location changes.
Have seen her advert a number of times and have been interested but finally arranged a meet earlier this week.
In real life, was disappointing compared to the photos. 
Not sure what I expected given the rate and it being BP after all, but she is shorter, chunkier, less attractive and older.  What more can ya say :-)
Jumped into the shower to freshen up, but even the apartment itself was old, cheap and run down.
I guess my expectations were high after some recent great BP experiences with Angela Sweet & Tala, but the quality of both the room and first impressions of the WL didn't bode well.
Sometimes unexpected great service lifts the session above and beyond, but not this time :-(
A bit of warm up DFK, followed by some BBBJ, cowgirl, doggie and then a Spanish finish.
If that sounds all too brief a summary believe me it was, after leaving I checked the time from being buzzed in to being back on the street and all told was just under 20 mins.
Having said that I was happy to be out and gone in 20.
On the positive side though, she's a pleasant enough girl to talk to, the BBBJ was better than average and those tits are close enough to the pic as far as the Spanish finish goes to be a highlight.
Not for me again though I'm afraid, too many other options around to warrant a repeat bout.
YMMV though, as they say, so would be interested to hear other's Pink experiences.

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.) 
Ive seen this girl before and when she contacted me to saying that she would be available near my work today I grabbed the opportunity. However, she is in of Melbourne's apartment towers and I really dislike having to manage the floor number pads at the main entrance. Anyway, I went to the building. She sends me the room number. I punch in the code at the door and go to the lifts. There is a crowd, all Chinese waiting for the lift. We squeeze into the lift. I press the button for the floor and the light doesnt stay lit up, and of course the lift doesnt stop at the floor I need. So, I get off at the next floor and in a moment of near panic I decide to walk down the stair well to the floor I need. You can probably guess what happens when I get the floor I need the door is locked internally and I cant get out of the stairs. When Emily contacts me querying the delay I beg her to come and let me out of the stairwell. 
Once we are in the room its back to normal. We both strip off. She is as slim as I remembered and she is soon between my thighs sucking my cock and then sitting on top of me. Its not long before I finish inside her. Despite the access problems I'll be back to see her.

Is this on Collins Street because I had similar problems with the lift in one of these high rises on Collins.

Most apartment lifts will time out if it takes to long to catch a lift from the time you get buzzed in

If anyone is interested she messaged me and she now seems to be in Box Hill.

She may be found in one of the new towers in Box hill, this suburb is starting to mirror the CBD with its traffic congestion

Nationality or Ethnicity : Claimed part Portuguese. Ad says Eurasian. There's a shitload more Asian than Euro in her though.

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : 

The photos in the ad are most likely her, but from some time ago. I went in to see her before a meeting, and after figuring that it wasn't a bait and switch, it was just really old photos, decided to stay, but for a deal of $120/20 mins. Her CBJ was first class, great application and enthusiasm. Then it all went downhill. Her heart just wasn't in it, and, to be fair, mine neither really. After a few minutes of desultory cowgirl, tried for mish but got Fromia monilis. Ended up with a poor HJ. Not really worth the effort.

Said she's been in Melbourne for two months, working the whole time. Dunno how she will pay her uni fees...

Yes sadly Dean thats par for the course with most of these girls.
And I notice lately a lot of the girls are advertising as Colombian, Brazilian whatever to suck the gullible punters in.

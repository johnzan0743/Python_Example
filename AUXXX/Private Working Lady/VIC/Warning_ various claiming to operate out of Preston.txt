 Warning: various claiming to operate out of Preston
				
Post Content: 
Hey everyone,

Just discovered a huge bait and switch effort running from a new apartment block in Preston. They are advertising on locanto and skokka, and are so good even my well honed BS antennae were deceived. Long and the short of it is, one boss, two girls who basically are older slappers. I met with one, who told me that they (the WLs) are bearing the brunt of a lot of pissed off punters. Thought I would share here to stop any further grief for the poor WLs or anyone else here.

Unsure of the best way to share the address; they are working out of a premises with a street address of 5. (Mods if this is too much, or I can add more, feel free to delete or PM me so I can update).

Dean

There is more than 2 in that building.
The ones with the entrance to the room from the street ,there is 2 girls in that apartment . Then there are a few different girls working in appartments inside.
Definitely avoid the outside girls, every time I've been in that apartment you get a punter banging on the door after about 15 min and won't let up .

Street name or street number is acceptable, but not both - for the girls security and safety.

There were only two interesting ads on Locanto. Was texting both and was given same address. Decided too good to be true. Darcy and Fabia. Will try to paste links. If you know "white" in one of the main European languages.

Thanks for the headsup. This was an inside apartment.

Weird fucking apartment block. The lifts were not working when I was there, and walking up the fire escape I passed the most magnificent specimen. Big smile, cheery hello, massive tits and great legs in a yellow skirt. Kind of made the whole experience worthwhile.

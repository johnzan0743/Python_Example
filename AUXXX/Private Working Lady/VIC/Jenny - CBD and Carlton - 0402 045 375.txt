Services Provided : FS and refund, respectively

Value for money/recommend? : No, bait and switch

My experience/comments : 

TL;DR: Classic bait and switch. I was then directed to a second apartment where there was a far better looking girl, but still felt ripped off

See the ad on backpage, looks good, looks like a discount to what now seems to be the going rate of $150/30 for FS. Even though it's a bit out of my way, I end up at apartments in Franklin St. Get buzzed up to the room nice and promptly, extremely dark inside, girl behind door. I hand over my money, get shown to the bedroom where there is some light, and there is no way this chick is the one in the ad. I show her the ad on my phone, and say, that's not you. No it isn't, she says. Not on, I say, give me my money back please. So I get my $120 back, and leave. By the time I have reached the lift well, I am directed to the girl in the ad in an apartment in Carlton, about a 3 minute walk away.

Rock up there, a bit of pissfarting around, and then I get buzzed in. Now this chick is the real deal. At least, she is definitely the girl in the top photo in the ad (same outfit being worn; definitely same body), but the face is nothing like the other three photos. Whatever. By this staged I am both toey and pissed off.

I've only got 20 minutes left, so pay my $100. Then I discover that in the 20 minute option, DATY is an extra $20. We then haggle a bit over BBBJ, and I end up getting DATY, 69, and BBBJ for +$30. To be fair to Jenny, she's got a great set of tits, and a nice arse for grabbing. What followed was a reasonable root in the usual positions. For clarity: I paid a total of $130.

What I learned from this: call the bait and switch bluff. Worst case, you save your hard earned. Best case, you end up with the girl in the ad. Of course, if you are time constrained, all of the pissfarting around doesn't help (there have been some days when I've had a limited window, and due to the bait and switch routine I've wasted my time, ending up with blue balls (but admittedly a fatter wallet)).

Jenny had a good bod, average face and average service. Could not recommend after all of the mucking around.

I have tried ringing some of these Asian girls on backpage, where they advertise $150 for 30 min, and each time it is extra for BBBJ.  I have stayed clear of these girls as they are never like the fake photos

I was fairly sure this was going to be a B&S but was in the area so thought would check it out. WL that opened the door was ok looking and looked fresh out of the shower. Walked and then go another text from another number for another WL which I ignored. Found a real ad (Mayoko) and had a good booking.

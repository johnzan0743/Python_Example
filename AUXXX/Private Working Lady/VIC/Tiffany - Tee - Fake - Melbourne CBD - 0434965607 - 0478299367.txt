My experience/comments : Last time I went to this building on a level over 64 in apartment with a number less than 02 the old woman answered and as I was in a rush I didn't walk. When I got the address for this time I thought, ok, probably fake, wait for apartment. Got to building, got apartment number, yes, same, almost definitely fake. Never know so head up ready to walk if fake. Opens door, same old woman as last time. I say, I've seen you before and you are using fake photos. She was mumbling something about not fake, give good service and was blocking me from leaving. I said you have to let me  leave. Which she did very reluctantly with a very ugly and angry look on her face.

Well done "Like" for walking.
We need to start "walking" on these Locanto frauds so we can shut them down.
I for one am and have already.
That way hopefully we can get some sanity back in the Melbourne market.
Cheers

These frauds are like spammers. They don't care if 99 people ignore their email, if one replies it's been worth it. I reckon the economics for the fraudsters on locanto are probably tighter than that (need say 1 in 3 to stay to make it worthwhile), but yes, I now walk if it's not what was promised.

I usually end up with a torrent of abusive text messages, but then just block the number.

I have started to keep a log of the profile names of the Locanto "pimps" and the numbers they are using. Some of them are managing 10-15 girls and often in multiple states.
Have a look at this one for an example "dashbi2311"

https://www.locanto.com.au/by/dashbi2311/63cab4/

However, I am not sure it is going to help as I have found many times they have a different number(s) for each girl and surprisingly it can change quite often.
They must be purchasing mobile cards by the dozens...
I also believe some have multiple profiles on Locanto or every now and then delete and create a new profile.
If I find some decent or genuine profiles I will let you guys know.
If anyone has a better way to screen the "shite" out please let me know.
Cheers
Jas

P.S. Sorry mods if this is off topic in this thread. Let me know and we can start a new thread for Locanto...

One approach that seems to be reliable is when the WL is holding a card with phone number in the photo.

There is a theory gaining credibility that a lot of these fake ads are posted to drive business to the genuine advertisers.

The way this happens is guys tend to start ignoring all new ads including genuine ones to the detriment of other advertisers and newbies thus crowding out the newbies starting out in the biz or using Locanto services.

One of the ways around this is to respond only to Premium paid for ads that are verified by Locanto or indeed ignore any ads that elevate your expectations in other words ads that seem or appear to be too good to be true. Truth is they always turn out to be great advertising of a dud or non existent product.

You should in every case of a fake ad report it on Locanto. They have auto Moderation tools that remove ads and block the poster from reposting. This is usually only a mild solution.

The question of why all the fake ads and who wins are the questions that require pondering.

Clearly the answers are varied and many. The above is simply one answer that it drives traffic toward certain ads and thus business increases for those who are genuine. Or so the theory goes.

Or it may simply be a dam busters approach. Disrupting Locanto means boosting the alternatives.
If you remember this is what happened to Cracker and backpage in the last months of publishing....

Whatever it is that is behind the spam it makes this forum way more useful and credulous in reality.

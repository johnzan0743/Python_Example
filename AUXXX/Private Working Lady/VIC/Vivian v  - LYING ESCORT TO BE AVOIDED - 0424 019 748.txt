My experience/comments :

I'm not normally write review but I think by sharing this experience will help others avoid losing money , you might have different experience but this is my experience recent and real .

So I've decided to treated myself this Christmas , afraid of going through BP and Locanto for fake ads . I'm moving to Scarlet Blue website that's where I guess was my 1st mistake !

I got attracted to this escort posting due to her special Xmas special $720 for two hours PSE which I think fair should all the services is real . Upon contacting got pleasant replied however insist on deposited 1st for $50 which I'm happy to do .

When the play date had been set and I thought this going smoothly , this was where things went wrong ! 

She not contactable on the booking day leaving all messages and call out then later on claimed some incident happened and said sorry ! I'm not a horrible person so I accepted that apology. She then asked for help on rental pay upfront in cash for $500.

Well since its Christmas a week to go , I don't see the harm of helping someone hence I agreed and met up gave her the cash . This lady then put all sort of promises on the play date which including extend the play or multiple play dates .

THEN WHEN THE ACTUAL DAY COMES , SHE DISAPPEAR AGAIN ?! And said she not have enough rental payment and got abused ? 

Out of sorriness I helped her another $500 to be on her feet then we go on a dinner which she said she got a booking later hence we CAN NOT do any booking 

Well and then all other messages just asked for more money and lame excuses , I know I got tricked by then but really I'm ok cause with a characteristic like this . The escort will run into multiple problems soon enough 

So even with verified face , meeting is real . Things can happen out of hand if the escort in this case is [Removed by Moderator] VIVIAN just using all the past review / client to tricked you , un-trust worthy , well you might have a better luck than I am.

I personally think she on drug with all the skeleton looking and tiny terrible looking tits

Hi tonyd3. Thank you for your post. You will probably receive some replies to your above that will indicate that ....with no disrespect ... a fool for trusting. I feel sorry for you and I commend you on giving someone a helping hand during a special time of the year. When your disappointment dissolves and the bitterness of the lost money gets put into perspective you will understand you were punished for being a good person with sound values. No shame in that. Merry Christmas

You're ok with being naive? Mate, you should seriously reconsider how trusting you are because it will lead you to being fucked over again and again. Despite what other say here I can't see how a $450 an hour escort with an expensive drug habit is who can afford to advertise on SB is more worthy of assistance than a homeless guy with absolutely nothing.

There seems to be some similarity with THIS report.

Maybe the same person but Scarlet Blue surely should be made aware of any workers scamming under their banner.

you got scammed out of $1k+ by someone you think is too skinny and has terrible looking tits... I'd hate to know how much someone you're attracted to could of swindled you for.

Hi Tony 

I feel for you and losing that sort of money is devastating. 

Let me make it up to you. I have a bridge for sale. Its on Sydney Harbour and a great view of the Opera House. You could put a toll on it even bridge climbs perhaps. 

PM me if interested.

$50 deposit seemed reasonable and not a huge loss to lose if she skipped town. No way would I have given her more cash without the goods.

On this basis maybe paying $1050 not to fuck a dude is worth it.

My experience/comments : 

I texted Carrie early in the morning and was surprised to get an early reply back from her. Made an appointment for later in the morning, and rocked up to the apartment. No joy. Texting, calling, nothing. Ah well, nothing lost there other than 15 minutes of my time, so no big deal. Later in the day, out of curiosity, I texted her again -- what happened? Got an apology, she'd fallen asleep and slept through the appointment time. Can I make another booking, and I can get $20 off to apologize.

All good, make another booking and rock up. It's her in the ad -- so an honest backpage ad -- and she remembers the discount, so it's $60 for 20 minutes. She undresses, I undress, we start off with some light kissing and fondling, and I muff dive her. No no, she says, that's another $30, for you $20. OK I say, pay you later? OK she says. We then proceed into some uninspiring sex, but at least it's not mechanical.

Cassie is proud of the fact she's genuinely independent, and for the price was an OK root.

WIR? perhaps.

I'm thinking 'half service' is no DATY, no 69, no LFK, no FIV. 'Full service' includes those things, but BBBJ is an extra. Can them text back: is this half service or full service?

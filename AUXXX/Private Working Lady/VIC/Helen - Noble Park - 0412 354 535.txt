My Experience/Comments:
Found the number for this place in the usual online places. It is a bit of a dodgy setup, the room has a massage table in it, with a portable heater and a kind of bed on the side. No music or anything playing.
Helen is a pleasant enough chinese woman who has the nerdy asian look about her, and for something different opted to sit down while massaging me. She started with some sensual soft strokes then asked if i wanted soft, medium or deep tissue. It was a day off, and I wanted to relax so I told her she can continue with the soft. I wouldn't call it much of a massage, but her touches were quite sensual and a turn on. Just before asking me to turn over, she proceeded with lots of sensual touches between the legs getting close to the nut sack. Was asked to turn over and Helen commented on how turned on I seem to be. She suggested for an extra $10 she can touch me a bit more in certain places and provide me with some relief. At that bargain price I erred a little as to not appear too eager and finally said ok.
A little bit of sensually touching the nipples, and playing with the area underneath the balls, she then got some oil (which she did not use for the massage) and gave me quite a nice handjob, with a failry intense orgasm.
Helen is pleasant, but she did answer the phone a few times during which i didn't really like.

Helen sounds like a girl that operated from a flat in Gladstone Road called Bridget, odd name for a chinese girl but the description is spot on. Did see her a few times but the clothes stayed on, allowed some touching after a few visits but as she was sitting below the table height not much you could reach. She started out slimmer but had pulled the rip chord towards my last visits some 18 months ago. As for the service I agree with Stanley it was generally good.

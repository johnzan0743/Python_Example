My experience/comments : 

[Mods -- I was not sure where to put this. I thought it would be useful info for all, but feel free to move it.]

I saw an ad on backpage. The photos looked damned hot, and tineye came up negative, so I thought I might try it, even though my punting is a bit limited at the moment. Frankly $150 for 30 minutes with someone like that, I'd probably sell my grandmother to effect a rendezvous. Send a text, get a response, a bit of argy bargy, and then I tried something. I texted the other person and said, "If I get there and it's not the person in the photos, I'm walking." No response for about 5 minutes, then I get a stream of incredibly honest text messages.

"There are two girls here."

"One from Russia" [image sent through, nothing like the beauty on the link, more like a hard-worn woman who has spent too much time in a cold land and too much money on vodka]

"Girl from Japan" [two images sent through, nice curves, butt ugly]

"Very sex!" [sic]

I replied back, no thanks, then I got:

"Give you both girls for price of one"

BY this stage I'd lost interest (only really if it were the chick on the photos [yeah, right]), so I declined.

Anyway, it got me thinking. Clearly with some pimps, if you call out beforehand what you will do with bait and switch, they will move to a more honest method of broking. Food for thought. 

It saved me a lengthy trip and frustration. If this helps anyone else here, go for it.

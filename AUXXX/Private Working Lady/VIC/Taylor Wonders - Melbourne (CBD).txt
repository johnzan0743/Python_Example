 Taylor Wonders - Melbourne (CBD)

Taylor Wonders advertises on Private Girls.

I tried to meet her in December in a CBD hotel but she was running seriously late, like 5 hours & I hung around waiting, but in the end gave in.

Anyway tried to see her since then but basically she barely responds to email and never to SMS.

She emails me on Australia Day asking if I want to meet the following day. I reply yes and never hear back from her. I read reviews on FIA so she seems real, but I suspect she works a 9 to 5 job and does this on the side. I am confused, am I wasting my time, please help?

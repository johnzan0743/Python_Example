Full review to follow later, but a warning about this one.

The bait and switch arms race has escalated. In short, I was about to walk as it was an obvious bait and switch, when a counter offer of a double for the same price came in. Idiot here said yes.

Avoid at all costs.

Person's Name : Aoya (I think) and Jessie

Establishment : Private Apartment

Date of Visit : June 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 404 - File not found

Hours of Business : Unknown

Rates : $150/30

Age : Both in their 20s

Size/shape : Aoya, looked great in a bikini, saggy tits and arse once out; Jessie slim, small tits

Nationality or Ethnicity : Aoya - Taiwan, Jessie - Singapore

Services Provided : Kind of FS, kind of CBJ, plus other unwanted services (see below)

Value for money/recommend? : Fuck no. Avoid at all costs.

My experience/comments : 

So I see this ad on package, good looking non-Asian chick in the photos. Send a text. Warning flag number 1: I get a text back from a different number. Dickhead here decides to push ahead anyway; they are located less than 5 mins from where I am. Get to the apartment block, warning flag number 2: a heap of pissfarting around to get the apartment number to dial in. Go in anyway. Get to the door upstairs. I knock. No response. I knock again, a bit more loudly. No response. I start to text them again to say I'm outside the door when I hear heels on tiles running towards the door. Warning flag number 3: it opens to a darkened apartment. It also reeked of cigarette smoke. I get escorted to the bedroom, get inside. Warning flag number 4: it's a bait and switch. This chick (Aoya), holds out her hand saying "One fifty, one fifty." Can barely speak a word of Engrish. I pull out my phone, "This isn't you. I'm leaving."

"I get other girl."

Dickhead moment number 2: believing that the other girl is the chick in the photo.

Other girl comes in, even less like the photo.

"I'm leaving," I say. At this stage they actually block me from leaving the bedroom. We give you double for same price, they say. Warning flag number 5: if it's too good to be true, it normally is.

So I cave, pay the folding, the girls nude up to reveal massively disappointing bodies and ask me to lie down on the bed. At this point one of the girls grabs a sheet of paper from a bedside drawer; it's a menu with a list of extras (tongue kissing, DATY, natural oral, etc) in English and presumably Chinese, along with costs. Everything was $50 extra. Wanting me to point out which extras I wanted. Yes thanks, I'll have the number 5, with extra soy sauce. FFS.

No, I'm not interested, I say, so on goes the 'dom and Aoya commences a CBJ. She then rips off the dom and hops on top. This was the highlight; the only time either of the girls appeared to be faking it and not just in it for the cash. Meantime I'm trying to slip Jessie's boob into my mouth, only to be told it's extra. FFS #2.

We switch to doggy, and then switch girls; Jessie goes into doggie. At this point, Aoya scratches me. And when I say scratches, I'm not talking an erotic tickle of the fingernails. I'm talking clawing at me, drawing blood. All the way down my back, and on my shoulder.

I ask her what that was for, she says playing. Not on I say. Jessie then pulls herself away, and says out of time, we give you hand job. I lie back down on the bed, and then Jessie goes at me with her nails, not drawing blood this time but by fuck it hurt.

By this stage I have had enough, fuck it, I say, I'm getting out of here. I get up, get dressed and leave (after getting some tissues to stop the bleeding).

It's after I leave that I stop off to get a bite to eat to find they have also cleaned out my wallet (I think it must have been when they were waving around the extras menu and I was distracted, the other one got into my pants and took the cash). It was $60, so not too bad a hit, but I didn't even leave the room and they managed to filch the cash.

I've found at least two other advertisements using the name Nora that is them:

I am very good skill in bed - Melbourne escorts - backpage.com.au
Nora Killer Body - CALL NOW babe - Melbourne escorts - backpage.com.au

when I have texted the numbers in the ads, the response comes back from the same third party number that texted me.

Now I quite enjoy punting, I'm in it for pleasure, not to demean or hurt the WL. I believe I always strike a balance between getting the best deal for myself and respecting the WL. But this. This was just fucking nasty. I've still got big red weals from Aoya's scratching on my chest. And I'm $210 lighter and with blue balls for the experience.

Avoid, guys, and you'll escape unscathed.

WIR? No.

Dean.

Thanks for your report Cl-dean. What started to read as quite an amusing report which was likely to end in as just another one of those "coulda/shoulda done better than that" ended up a disaster. Not just for the switch, but the scratching (likely she knew what she was doing), the service cutting (Jessie then pulls herself away, and says out of time, we give you hand job), and finally the blatent theft. The theft I don't take lightly and thank you for the warning. This advertisement should be taged with AVOID AVOID AVOID.

Not at all! Armed with a new experience to learn from, and also it's resolved my will to walk if a bait and switch is on.

Just to clarify this: she ripped off the dom, put another on, and then hopped on top. There was no BB here.

Yes that was a bad outing. Best to not step into the room and stand in doorway with door open. All doors are inward swinging so as long as you stay on the outside of the door should be able to walk. Sometimes the switch is ok, but then they don't do services and if can't speak same language very hard to debate using Google translate. If they're 1 minute late walk. I once got texts for next 45 min saying she was 5 min away. If apartment is a mess with old takeaway food, cigarette stench get out of there. What's that pussy going to be like. Sometimes it's unavoidable but best to only take the cash and nothing else, except the phone with password lock. There are some genuine fun WLs out there.

Surely Dean you didn't expect to see the girl in the ad?  she is here: Do something for yourself - Imgur   (Angie Varona) A girl like that would be asking for $600 plus per hour.

My experience/comments:

Saw Cartier was advertising genuine bi-doubles with Sophia Cardin and the thought of the blonde/brunette combo had me reaching for my phone and sending Cartier an email. Abit of back and forth with emails discussing the finer details of the session and settled on $900 each for 1.5 hours including some requested extras.

The day came and when I was greeted at the door by the 2 blondes...wait 2 blondes? I entered and Cartier greets me, she looks abit older than what her photos suggested however she was still a hottie no doubt. She informed me that Sophia had not been feeling well and her friend Vanessa came down from the county to fill in and asked if I was happy to proceed. I was alittle disappointed as the main reason I booked a double was for the blonde/ brunette combo however Vanessa was very beautiful, head turningly beautiful. I decided to go ahead and do not regret it at all.

I won't go into the nitty gritty but I will mention the highlights; Cartier bbbj as I dfk vanessa while still standing in the lounge, watching Vanessa enjoy Cartier's daty skills and the COF finish x2

Highly recommend Cartier and her bi-double service and she is very hospitable!

Way out of my bracket. But for that cash I would expect exactly what I asked for with gold plating. You said yourself that Cartier was older than her pics suggested, and that the other girl was a no show. And you only found this out when you arrived!!!! For that money you'd think they could spend the massive 28 cents and send you A text saying your first choice was unavailable. Frankly this is crap service. Again, for $1800 you'd expect better. Fuck me, $1800. I can hardly fathom it.

This. Honestly that's terrible service and there should be repercussions for foisting compromises on a client who they know is going to think with the little brain.

Each to their own for sure, but from my point of view for $1800 I would rather get a cheap flight to Asia, get a cheap but nice hotel and have about 8-10 sessions of sex with amazing local hotties including a threesome or two!

$1800 in Thailand gets you sex for 2 weeks and that would include quite a few 3 somes.
Good luck to you Lanky as long as you enjoyed it, nothing else matters, must be great to have money to burn like that for a 1.5 hour session.

Put this in perspective. 

1800 bucks can get vip in Marquee and Ivy with bottle service and 21 yr old chicks to boot.

The Philippines or some SE Asian country for a week and you'd be serious enough to get some viagra or its equivalent for the amount of pussy to get.

Even locally you'd get chicks to go BB at Stiletto or Penthouse or LPA for that amount. 

If you got it then its up to you to spend it. I personally don't  know if I would do it yet its your perogative. 

More power to you @lanky

@mikemelb. That's why I said "more power to you"

We live in a free society where we can spend money on something that is illegal in other states and countries. 

Maybe we're just jealous that he can spend that amount on booty. Cos if we had funds like that we'd do it

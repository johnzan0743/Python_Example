I understand you did not enjoy yourself but a bit more detail is required.

I do not have time to write war and peace and it seems moderators are keen for lurid detail. I believe I have provided sufficient information and don't need to provide more graphic detail for you or other titillation.

Her service was dire and not even close to a reflection of what she assured was on offer....simple

I wager you're still happy to reap the benefits of reviews written by others that are as you'd say, "War and Peace".

You haven't.

It's not for titillation, it's so that the reader can decide for themselves if they'd like to see the provider or not. All we got from your review was a broad statement. 



How the mods here put up with stuff like this and not end up head butting a wall is beyond me. My hat is off to you gents. My apologies if this post steps over a line, but damnit it's frustrating!

It is frustrating and your post is fine.

A detailed review enhances the credibility of the reviewer and provides evidence for potential customers. Since the review is about
paid for sex, it seems as difficult to avoid explicitness as it is when discussing a medical issue with a health provider. How heavy is up to the poster, but a post that fails to report the sequence of events, the circs, and the providers appearance is not worth much to most reasonable people.

Thank you on behalf of the moderating team.

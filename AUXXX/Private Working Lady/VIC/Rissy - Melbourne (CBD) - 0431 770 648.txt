My experience/comments : Found this ad on gumtree for a lady offering full body massage in moone ponds. Didn't give any hint about a happy ending on the phone. Anyway, i was stressed and decided to take a chance anyway. Went to her house, a private house in moone ponds. Started with a backrub. Also started cuddling my cock while i was lying on my stomach. Surely wasn't a good masseuse. But what the heck. Asked me to turn around after some time and rubbed oil all over my chest and cock. Fondled for some time and then went back to massaging my legs. It was all over after 5 mins.

Not a very great experience. Wont go back to her if I find something better.
Overall - 5/10

My experience/comments : You almost fall over when the door is opened by an elderly Chinese woman with about 3kg of make up on and dressed like some sort of creepy Punky Brewster. I should have walked but didn't.
Got a terrible massage, it wasn't even a rub. Then a sad t. Pretty much one to put in the vault and never ever mention again. This one made me sad.

My experience/comments : 

Had a little difficulty in the beginning to get her to respond but that happens with wechat. I think they are either so invested in their private ramblings that they let the business side down a bit. 
After some mucking around I was told to wait in the foyer and she will come to get me. In walked a lovely little Asian girl with her shopping bags groceries mainly and took me by the hand as if I was her boyfriend. I liked this but a bit awkward as I would be 40n years her senior. 

Ushered into the bedroom where she gave me a kiss and jumped up on me for a cuddle. Nice. 
After she put away the groceries she came in and closed the door but not before I spied another little princess in the lounge room....next time maybe. 
She asked what I wanted and I said a little massage and a BJ. Ok $200, I said I had been waiting and been mucked around and would give her $150 which she agreed to. I am not normally given to negotiating but it seemed appropriate this time. Financials out the way she stripped me down then of with her own gear and what a tidy body. Fuck the massage.
I just gave her a cuddle and she responded with light kisses and wrapped her little legs around me. Just like a girlfriend would. 
I couldn't help myself and went for a cursory exploration and test sniff to find a sweet sweet puss. I dined for a while then she grabbed my hair and pulled me up for cuddles then on with a dom and munched away. A bit fast and lacking feeling to begin with but I slowed her down and it went well after that.

I got my full hour and would happily go back for her but the next time I sent a message I got a different girl I believe. I will keep trying however.

I found her using the Discover ...people nearby function.
I did get a message from her late last night and the user name and ID are correct. 
Did you search for Romantique Valentine? or the ID name? 
Thats about all I can add.

This is the screen shot of her profile


As you can see it is legit so I have no idea how to find her apart from going to Caroline Springs and doing a Discover Near me search.

You can block people from finding you via WeChat ID.  She must have that setting enabled for whatever reason and/or is only discoverable when working ??

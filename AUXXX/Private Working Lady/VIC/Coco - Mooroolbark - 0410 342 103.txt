My experience/comments : 

TL;DR: This was like a bad John Le Carre novel. It went on forever, nothing much happened, and I reached then end wondering why I had wasted my time.

God this was horrible. Saw this chick, was going to be in the middle east of Melbourne, so Croydon was right on the edge of where I could reach with various time constraints. Texted her, quick text back, she's in Mooroolbark!  We then got into negotiations on price; with her original amount I simply said it was too expensive, thanks anyway, then she kept on creeping down, $150, $145, asked me what I normally paid: $120/30 I said. Silence. Then after a while, OK. You come? What time?

Rock up to the address. Then I go through a heap of Cold War cloak and dagger bullshit that Le Carre in his prime could not have made up before I finally get to the house. About the only thing missing was a dead drop under a bush next to a duck pond. Given the amount of construction going on in the area, it would have been more subtle to give me the address, as I am sure the construction workers wondered WTF a bloke was doing running around the back streets of Mooroolbark making hand signals to an unseen person to ensure he was the person the unseen person was talking to on the phone).

Anyway, I get a text -- shoes off! which I oblige and enter. House is dark; come upstairs darling! Never a good sign... Lock the door darling!

So I get upstairs, then see this chick in about 9/10th darkness. Cue back to Le Carre -- maybe I am picking up a microfilm. There are garbage bags taped on all the windows and even a skylight. FFS. Then she tries to get me to fork out $160 for the 30 minutes. I don't think so. Ah, sorry, my mistake she says. We finally get into a room with the bed and ye gods! The photos on the site are of her but they are either a) about 10 years old, or b) photoshopped. I get undressed.

She comes back in, yanks at the chain three times as if she is flushing a dunny, then looks down puzzled. Hmm, not hard? Why not? She then applies a condom my my limp dick, lies me down on the bed, and produces which is, to be fair, a pretty good CBJ. Once I am good and hard, she lubes up, jumps on top, slides up and down twice and says, "Have you come yet?" Now there may have been an extra half slide in there, so I am doing her a disservice, but really.

The rest of the session went downhill form there and by the end I was so pissed off that I ended saying fuck it and left with blue balls.

I got dressed, she got dressed, and as I was about to leave one last roll of the Le Carre dice. I was given instructions on how to leave the house a different way that I came in, and I should not turn the car around but go through some convoluted set of back streets to escape. Presumably there is an undercover Stasi officer posing as a construction worker next door. 

It may be I was given the hurry on and poor attitude because I negotiated. But she ended up accepting -- either do it with good grace or wait for the next punter.

Do not go there, do not waste your time or money. The CBJ was the highlight, but that may have only stood out because everything else around it was a desolate landscape filled with the remains of the Berlin Wall.

If that's really her but older, she looks hot. Even though you had a bad time it was a good story! Asian girls can be very paranoid at times. The dark lighting, odd directions all part of it. I remember driving some girls from a shop around and they always made me take different routes and check if they were being followed!

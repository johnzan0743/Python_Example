Feeling horny but not wanting to travel very far, I saw an ad in Backpage for Jasper in East Melbourne. The reply to my text was from a different number (sorry I deleted off my phone) and that should have sent alarm bells straight away.  

I asked about BBBJ, and they replied that will be extra.  I replied, I don't pay extras, so the reply back was ok, $150 30 min with BBBJ.

On arrival, surprise surprise (not), the girl at the door is an older Chinese, not Thai as in the ad.  I have seen this girl now three times, and each time I was not overly rapped in her service - it is a just a standard service.  I really should have walked, but it has been awhile and my dick did the talking.  She has twice before gone by the name Bella - once in an RNT in Lt Collins, and once in Spencer Street where the old bait and switch happened again.  I asked about this and she denied the name and pretended it wasn't her.

Well the trouble didn't stop there.  She started with some kissing all over the body, no DFK, which didn't worry me.  She then went lower and lower and stopped to pull out a condom.  I said we had agreed to BBBJ, and she replied, no that is extra. It was clear that she had no idea on what had been agreed to.  She said, ok but she would only do 20 minutes with BBBJ - after some discussion, I agreed to go on as I wanted out of there.  Her BBBJ was pretty good but not spectacular, on to FS, and we finished with Doggy and mish.

I got dressed and showed her the messages on my phone and she was getting a little upset and trying not to cry. There was clearly some issues with her boss

 This girl is a little unstable and I remember from last time she was a little weird as well.  Personally, I don't think she should be in the game as she wasn't enjoying any of it.

Agree Acharya, once bitten twice shy. Tell them to shove it up their arse may help improve the shit service if enough people do it.

I should have explained.

1. RNT - didn't know what she was like.

2. Bait and Switch - ok, thought FS may be ok with her, as the first place was a RNT - no FS

3. Bait and Switch again.

I didn't know I was getting her.  Yes I should have walked the 3rd time.

Yup. Gotta walk. If they are late, walk. If the are fake, walk (unless they are hotter than the ad!). If they can't speak a language you speak, walk. Confirm what's included by text. Assume all ads are fake.

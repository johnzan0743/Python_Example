My experience/comments : Turned up, not the girl in the pics, but it was late, i was horny, and i had no time to go elsewhere. I don't need to say much but it was one of the worst shags i've ever had. The girl didn't even know how to fuck properly, she moved around like someone having a fit. Crap massage to start, crap BJ, crap shag. Dumped my load and got out of there.

I'm seeing a few operators (no bookings or reviews as yet) who advertise via WeChat only and searchable via usernames who point blank refuse to give out numbers in Melbourne's CBD.

For those who use it, it's searchable for a finite number of users in your area. For example, in the CBD you can only "see" up to 3km. At home, it maxxes out at 20km for the same number of contacts. The vast majority of females on there (if you search "female only") are incall/outcall, massages and uni students. 

I feel very disadvantaged by not being able to speak Cantonese/Mandarin.

@whiteywhite thanks for TOFTT.

My experience/comments : Had seen Carol's ad a few times and thought it could be a go. Seemed genuine, but the proof is that my success rate for genuine is 1/3. Booking etc all good. As soon as texted got the usual services stuff and a couple of photos from the ad. I'm now thinking that is a sign that it is all fake. Anyhow, door to apt opens and she hides in the shadow behind the door swing. My last visit to this building was a fake (Liliana, who's still using those fake photos) and was being cautious. I don't mind if the actual WL is different from the WL in the photos, but so long as she's ok. This time, old, scraggy and not doable, so just said you aren't the girl in the photos and walked. As I left the building I got a text from "Carol", agent somewhere after WL reported in that it was a walker. "Would you like to see my friend in the building?" Was probably Liliana! Anyhow, I had a backup plan and swung that into action as limited time window. That review next.

My experience/comments : Called the phone number and said I will be there in 10 minutes after she gave me the address. I knock on door and she says sorry not working today. I should of seen that as a sign and turned on my heels and walked away. All of a sudden she has a change of mind and says come in there is no escaping now .  I must admit the medium massage was very good as I was feeling quite sore in the lower back region. Lots of tackle on the nutsack and then asked to flip over. Massage was a very happy conclusion with a head and face massage after she disappeared to wash her hands, thankfully she is into great hygeine.

Wont be rushing back in a hurry all the conversation was uggh and mmmm from her

Saw Jade's ad one night and thought it was a reasonable price, made an appointment to see her.


Closer to the time I got a few txt to shift my booking as "she can't be waiting all night while missing business". OK...being the nice guy that I am, I saw her a bit later in the evening.


Rocked up and was greated by the same girl in the advert, heavy made up face, nice and slim with big fake tits. Yum!


Chit chatted a bit, and as per Joeu1741's review, no kissing makes it a bit hard to break to ice. I started by kissing her neck and moved down onto her tits and sucked them hard. Heard a moan and thought that's probably a good thing and continued sucking on them which got both of us hot and bothered real quick. More groping and a nice BBBJ ensured; next thing I knew I was pressing my cock against her panty covered cunt. Rubbed against her cunt for a few minutes, took of her panties and did some DATY which was tasty. Finally time to fuck, dom on, mounted and pounded away. Jade made all the appropriate noises and certainly let me know how she liked it. Pulled out, dom off, BBBJ until I drained my balls into her waiting mouth. 


All in all a decent punt, but the no kissing thing is a killer. Not sure if I will be back.

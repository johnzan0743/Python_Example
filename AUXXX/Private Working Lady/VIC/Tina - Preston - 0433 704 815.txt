My experience/comments :    I was in the Preston area for work and had some time to kill so tried a few of my usual haunts which were not good so decided to have a look on Locanto.  I have never punted from Locanto before so did not really know what I was doing but soon found all these ads for "young girls" in Preston that sounded great   So sent "Lisa" a text and got a quick reply that she was available now and she sent me the address of the private apartment in Preston with the room number. Was getting pretty excited as the photos looked good so rock up and get buzzed in and took the lift to her room.  Apartment building pretty modern so all looking good.  Got to the room which was left ajar for me, gave a knock and was greeted by..a 40 something PRC with enhanced breasts, bit of a tummy and a fair bit of makeup and work done to the face to try and make her look young. "Come in darling, come in" she said enthusiastically as she practically dragged me into the apartment and closed the door.  "Err are you Lisa ?" I said.   "No, No, I'm Tina darling, Lisa busy somewhere else".  Ok, so this is the classic misleading ads / bait and switch / try and rip you off scams that I have read about on Locanto.  Mustered up some courage and said firmly  "Well the ad said the girl was 21 and you look nothing like the one in the pictures so sorry I am not staying".  She then quickly grabbed me and said "Come on darling, me give you good service" and tried to pull me into the room. "Sorry, I'm going" I said and got loose of her arm and headed out the door and shut it behind me.   Jesus what a joke.might be my first and last Locanto punt attempt !!

Punt road,
Good on you for walking. I normally send them a message as well letting the pimp know I walked.
Hopefully we can chalk up a few wins and they may even get the message.
We live in hope.
Cheers
Jas

If that was the new building near Bell St, 2 for 2 fake so far. It's a bit scary when they won't let you leave. Best to stay in door opening if you can. If they hide behind the door usually a bad sign.

That is indeed the building Like. Was not scared at all but the building had a strange feel to it. Did not see anyone else on th e way in or out. Maybe just not fully occupied yet?

3 from 3. I got a fake here in August last year and walked (pretty sure I didn't review as there was nothing to review).

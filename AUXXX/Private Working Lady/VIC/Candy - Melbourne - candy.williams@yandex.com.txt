So in January this year, I came across an ad on locanto, A blonde busty girl, with legs that apparently went on forever, said she was around 22, 23. Managed to make contact, got her number, proceeded to secure a booking with her, she promised BBBJ, CIM, and said she would consider anal when we got together. So later that day, I met her, she was indeed a tall busty blonde, great tits on her, and very leggy. An Attractive girl and friendly. Clearly a young girl, in need of cash, and not a junkie, at least no signs that I could see, not by appearance or mannerisms. Well, she surely delivered, she did indeed provide BBBJ, she started off with it and she made sure I unloaded in her mouth. Actually, from the moment she started, it was all go, go , go. No stopping until she had my sailors swimming in her mouth. 
She sucked my cock for about half an hour, varying the speed and depth as time moved on, lots of deep throat too, no gagging. After the first load had jumped ship and had been disposed of, we spent about 15 minutes just having a chat, how she has a friend that is a registered WL, and told her to give it a try, hence here she was. She told me of the filthy requests some of the guys had, and the multitude of requests for bareback sex from guys, and the fact that they would become annoyed and abusive when she refused.

We decided on round 2, started with a BBBJ again, this girls loves to suck cock, loves deep throat too, then on with the dom and she demands that i pound her hard, a gentleman never refuses, so off we go, she was super tight, gets sopping wet, and when she orgasms, I think all the motel patrons knew about it.
Flipped her into doggy, and I remind her about the anal, she turns and looks at me and initially says she isn't sure if she can take it, I assure her we'll start slow, and she'll drive to begin with, she agrees immediately, and off we go, no lube, but we made it, and she loved it, once she had set the pace, and got things 'loosened up' a bit, she said it's over to me to drive, and drive I did. Like a F1 driver, I went for it. Man, she took it in there like an absolute champion, encouraging me all the way to keep going and repeatedly saying don't stop, fuck my ass. After about 15 minutes of slamming her tight little hole I came, I pulled out, pulled off the dom and released over the small of her back and her crack, jizz running down her arse, what a site.

Took a break, had a shower to freshen up, and back to the bed, bit of chatting, fooling around, before another slow  BJ to completion, releasing my last load for the day, and this one was kinda low in quantity compared to the other 2, but again, she deep throated me, and basically sucked it non stop from start to finish. All up it cost me $350 all up, for more than 2 hours of fun, no holes barred, and cim in mouth twice. 

I never saw or heard from her again after that, until a couple of days ago, I saw an ad, that aroused my suspicion, it seemed very familiar, so i sent an email and hoped for the best. No reply for a few days, then, when I had totally forgotten about it, I get a reply, with photo's and my suspicions were correct, it is indeed her, with a new phone number. I call up, we confirm that we do know each other, and work towards getting together. She can meet anytime, even tonight, but tonight she doesn't have a room, am I up for car fun? Am I ever. So we work out a time and about 2 hours later she's in my car, she has put on a bit of weight since our last play date, but she is attarctive and those tits look awesome,  we have a catch up chat, and we make our way to a little spot. Her BJ is still as awesome as it was, she sucks it, deep throats it, circles the head with her tongue, using her tongue ring to great effect, and when I give her the work that there may be some fluid displacement, she just keeps going, no change in speed or enthusiasm. Takes it all in ,no spills.

Fucked her a bit after a break, but the car can be uncomfortable, so reverted back to a BJ, until I came in her mouth again. This time it was about an hour and a half that we spent together, and I dare says she spent almost an hour with my cock in her mouth. $200 all up, only downside was the fact that we were in the car, so fucking was uncomfortable, so we didn't bother with tours to Greece this time, but a gret time nonetheless,  I drove her home, which was not far from our play spot, and en route for me to head home anyway. I will definitely be going for a no holes barred session soon.

Such a well written review but tempted to give negative rep with no details, not even a link to the locanto ad. For all we know the encounter didn't happen, or the girl doesn't even exist! Thanks for the cock tease!

I'm just going with the late to style of reviews, no contact info etc.  I've made the same type of comments about reviews lately,  and it didn't go down well.  So...., if I can't beat them, I'll join them. Steve, do some research.

The sensitivity concerns Massage Parlours and not private MLs.

Please check the 'Changes to forum. All members must read', http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f55/de...st-read-21518/

The forum has responded by restricting access to MP reviews to Silver and above.

There should be no reticence about posting contact details by Silver members.

Reviews without contact details will not be counted when members are audited.

I understand the deal. I get what you are saying about the massage parlours. However, this girl doesn't publish her number, she has no licence from the BLA. She even uses a proxy email address.  I agree, we are not 7 years old, so with that said, we can all do some research using the information at hand. She is at as much risk as the massage parlour ladies who are handing out extras. In all honesty, I could have put the details in, but chose not to because of the flood of bullshit reviews lately. You guys who have posted here will probably put this review into that bullshit basket too, but think about how many 1 liner reviews have been posted lately, with not even a clue as to what city or state the action took place in. 
I have no problem sharing, as some members on here already know, and have benefited from.

With all that said, if the mods want to pull the post, ok, if members want to give me negative reputation points,  Ok.  This is just an an enjoyable hobby, I really don't take it all that seriously, negative reputation points, or a pulled review, or anything that affects my forum experience, really isn't going to have an impact on me in my punting and non punting life.  Email Candy, wait on a reply from her, or a polite request for details will probably get a reply from me.

Mate be better than that

Just because some wankers are like that doesn't mean you need to turn into one.
In your defence you've written a good review, just frustration at other poor reviews let you down. Don't let it !!

Happy Punting

Mate not having a go at u. I agree with many one liners the last week has been shocking with from what it looks like new punters trying to get membership. And there is a member opening his mouth to a lot of ladies telling them about the forum. So I was just saying let not drop to there level and keep the info that is needed for others to enjoy. Great review on ur behalf so my bad if I offended u

Completely agree with most posts here, As I said earlier it's a well written review, but without a name and the faintest of links to an advertisement, other punters can't enjoy what you have already enjoyed. As someone that's coming down to melbourne in one week's time, I would like to see her, but Now I face the question of how?

Cheers, 

WMS

I have taken many for the team in the past and I also appreciate the work of others who have done so to my benefit, I am just bringing the point out there, that without the contact details or the advertisement of the WL, the review becomes void and simply reads as an erotic story, if that. Clearly the OP has taken one for the team and had an awesome time, but for the purposes of this forum, it is of no help. It would be better to save it as a memory in one of those harry potter-esque chamber of memories.

As for the excuse against the one liner reviewers, I never have been, and i typically write essays. I was just having my say, no need to go crazy, I don't actually mind taking one for the team but in this case, I'm down for not too long for business, so I would prefer to have some more details to make a quick and easy booking hence my post.

If the mods had a buck for each comment about a review, they'd be rolling in it.
It's rarely helpful to ask why someone did something: the reasons they had seemed good to them at the time.

Back on topic please.

Members should note that incomplete reviews, whether on the template or not, are not counted as reviews any more than 1 liners or chat. 

So, the tune of 'A policemans lot is not a happy one' 

"When moderating duty is to be done, to be done,
A post without all the details is not a valid review".

Just want to point something out (not directly to you, more general). WL's can go through all the effort they want to "hide" themselves, however they are still publishing a form of contact on a site notorious for sex acts. 

If a Locanto ad has any contact information (name, number, email) - I don't see any reason why this can't be shared on this forum. I am excluding the MP's from this by the way.

Thank you adventurous. Have updated the thread title accordingly. 

Please put Email only, Locanto ad only, Cracker ad only for the Contact details for providers who don't publish a phone number.

There are a few providers who insist on contact by the Ad reply form or Email.

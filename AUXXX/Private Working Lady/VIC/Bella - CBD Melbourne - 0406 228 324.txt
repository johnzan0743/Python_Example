Hours of Business : Not stated. I organised for a 12 noon app she just got out of shower when I arrived said she slept in.

Rates : $80 for 20 minutes (Ad is still on City of Love, rates have changed since March, increased)

Age : 30 -40

Size/shape : Nice body small very plain looking

Nationality or Ethnicity : Said PRC

Services Provided : F/S

Value for money/recommend? : Nothing to rave about, but for a quick $80 session, acceptable.

My experience/comments : Just before lock-down and I knew what was coming so decided to get a few quick punts in before the inevitable.
I managed to get in 3 punts and this was the first. I will review the others later.
Had some spare time at work so tried a few of the places in the CBD, most no answer.
I got an affirmative from this ad for Bella on COL. Cheap and nearby so I organised it and arrived there at just before noon.
To my surprise the room number was the same room where I saw Pandorabae in December 2019, review previously done.
Was greeted at the door by average looking PRC lady, not ugly and a reasonable body.
I handed her the $80 and asked where the shower was. Showered and back onto the bed.
A little bit of basic foreplay, CBJ to get me going. Then she asks me if I want her friend as well for an extra $50. So that would have been $130 all up for a 3some.
Declined the offer as my one and only experience with that was shit. I did not get to see her friend.
Once she had me up and ready I got her to adopt the dog style position.
This was the classic old whip it in, whip it out, wipe it, and walk away whistling session. Very basic, but the job was done.
She disposed of the full condom, cleaned me up and I was out of there.
The unusual thing about this punt was how quiet the streets of the CBD were as I walked there. And how the usual 10 to 15 punters waiting out the front to get the text for their room number, were not there. I had the keypad all to myself. First time at this place for me.
This will be no surprise to most punters, the pictures on COL are not the girl I saw, and most likely if I ever arranged to see Bella again, it would be a different girl again.
I have had a lot of good luck in here and although this was not the worst punt I have ever had, it was the worst in this particular apartment.

Person's Name : Lila

Establishment : Hotel in CBD

Date of Visit : 10/11/15

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :  0451 052 465 She also advertises on locanto but I cannot find the ad this morning!

Hours of Business : Unknown

Rates : $100/30 nude massage w/ HJ, $150 FS (but you can barter her down)

Age : 30s?

Size/shape : Average. Nice legs and boobs. Poor attitude.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Mongolian

Services Provided : FS

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : 

This will be quick. Found the ad on my phone and contacted the number. Was directed to a hotel in Elizabeth Street (one where I'd had a bad experience before, with a Mongolian), went up to the room, found out she wanted $150 for FS/30min, got her down to $120, she stripped off, I stripped off, she rubbed me for 30 seconds, applied some lube to herself, applied a dom to me, sucked for 20 seconds, rolled over and asked me to hop on top. After about 5 strokes she asked, "Are you finished yet?". When I said no, she lost all interest, as did I. Not allowed to touch her breasts, she won't go cowgirl, so she decided to give me a HJ instead. Jackhammer style, she nearly ripped it off! In the end I said forget it, and left with blue balls. Checked my watch. 10 minutes had elapsed.

Maybe she was annoyed about being bartered down, but I suspect not.

WIR? No.

Avoid.

Dean.

Wow. It all happened in 10 minutes!

It takes me that long to take my pants off.

Yeah, I thought that, but even so, why not just say no to the lower price?

Hi Mike, that's the ad, it may be her, but it's not easy to tell...

Thanks for locating the ad!

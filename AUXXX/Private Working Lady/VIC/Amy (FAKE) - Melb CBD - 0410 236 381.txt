My experience/comments : The girl in the photos has a smoking hot body. The ad's have been around for a while. Despite girl in photos holding a card with the number it wasn't the girl. When the street address was texted I was fairly confident that it was going to be fake and ready to walk. Haven't been to this address for a few years. Used to be a very shoddy operation in one of the front units back then. Different level and unit this time. When the door was opened it was pitch black in the apartment and no way to tell what the WL looked like. Got into the room and could see it wasn't the WL in the photos, but she looked ok so stayed. I asked her what her name was and she said Amy. I said you are not the girl in the photos. She said she was just has her hair different. Not a chance. She wanted to dom on early, bit o CBJ, then standing doggy, too hard too big, hardly, moved through a few positions to pass the time, decided mish with her legs closed felt the best so finished that way. WL gave me a few tissues to do self clean up then left to clean herself up. Dressed and out of there. Light was on the the apartment and noticed there was stacks and stacks of tissues, wipes, etc.

Black text on perfect white paper usually means the number has been photoshop.

There are almost no legitimate ones in the CBD area they are all fake I have walked out of so many here, best ones are when they have a picture of a white girl and it's an old Asian lady like how is that even a thing

Person's Name : Minty

Establishment : PWL (although W is not accurate)

Date of Visit : Late Apr 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : ????????actual MODEL AND MODEL MEASUREMENTS...IMPORT ??Genuine and real ??? NEW TO INDUSTRY??????? - Melbourne escorts - backpage.com.au

Hours of Business : Not sure, but time is of no concern to M

Rates : $180/0.5

Age : early 30's

Size/shape : Medium height, bit chubby, soft formless tits

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chineses

Services Provided : very brief CBJ

Value for money/recommend? : No / No

My experience/comments : I thought ad's with paper and phone number were reliable, but no, another bait and switch. Reminds me that if they are not on time, walk and don't wait because it won't improve. In the lift, M does not speak a word of English and used Google translator. Obviously texts were from someone else, maybe the girl in the ad! Into the room, stunk of cigarette smoke, and there was half eaten takeaway containers, packets of chips, lying around. Complete mess. Sort out the $. Onto bed, M goes straight for the dom and slaps some lube on WTF. I say no not yet but does for CBJ on a complete soft on. Works it up a bit and I say 69, back to translator, no, no, no she says. I say its in the ad. I then get up and want a refund. M can't find the money! Then only gives me back $150 and says I touched her and she touched me so I should pay her $30. I had wasted too much time and just wanted to get out of there.

Thanks for the warning, but she would have never sucked me in anyway. Why? 3 things, 2 in the opening sentence, and in the title, "new to the industry" dead give away, "model hailing from beijing". Again, dead giveaway. Look at all the bullshit ads on cracker and BP saying that. And the worst of all, $180.00 for 30 minutes, ffs, very risky  being prepared to pay that sight unseen. At least she admitted she was chinese most pretend to be japanese or koreans, that sucks the cashed up punters in, haha. There are nowhere that many japs and koreans working in melb, most are PRC.

We seek excitement, in privates and rnt's, but it looks like we should never have diverted from the brothel

I think it's always the the thrill of the chase, looking for a diamond in the rough that keeps us going back to these ads. Even though we know 90% are fake

My experience/comments : After my great punt with Danni the previous week, I thought I'd try my luck again with a touring PWL.  I settled on another brunette after seeing her (genuine) photos on cracker, despite her rate being higher than my self-imposed limit of $300/hr.  

I found Holly to be quite friendly but didn't feel the instant attraction I was hoping for; although she's got a nice enough face, it just didn't make my heart flutter like some other WLs and MLs.  She was well presented in black lingerie and stockings and has a nice body -- but also has multiple tattoos down her back and elsewhere so that it was hard for me to ignore them as I usually try to do.  (Ugh!  Why do they do this?!)  There was plenty of kissing (she's pretty good at this), boob play and fingering, followed by a CBJ (she's even better at this), with some welcome eye contact.

At her request, I went down under and licked her bald pussy for several minutes until she dug her fingernails in my arms, convulsed and moaned as she came.  Pretty sure it was legit so I was pleased with myself.  The sex was OK but nothing earth-shattering and I duly consummated our brief relationship.  We spent a bit of time chatting and it seemed she may make regular trips to Canberra.

In short, a pleasant enough time, but slightly bland and somewhat overpriced in my view.  A bit like NZ.

Sadly, no.  It wasn't quite 'my mistake' but she was 'one step ahead' and I did leave a 'poor boy'.

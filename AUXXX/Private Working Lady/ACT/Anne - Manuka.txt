No, her dates have so far never matched mine. Had an email from her a few months ago that didn't set off any alarms. I've called her number to check dates on her voicemail and the voice is unusual but intriguing. Nothing to suggest she's not genuine so far. I'm happy to TOFTT if dates align, but if you get there first BullD1, be sure to report back.

As in, a bit masculine perhaps?

Interesting indeed, the ad rings bells for me as I'm not that keen to go

She actually advertises in the Canberra Times and on Mates4Rent as "Mature. Sexy Anne."

:: Welcome To mate4rent.com ::

She's being in the paper for a few weeks now on and off. I rang out of interest and would agree with Phil's comment about the voice. Personally, I just found it to be a very coarse, smokers voice with perhaps a bit of moonshine to slur it. Didn't sound like my cup of tea.

Ok, I'm 80% sure I saw Anne last month. She works out of an apartment in Manuka.

So while she is a nice lady and resonably slim, she is older (my guess would be 50ish). She gave a good massage on a proper massage table, with an ok CBJ followed by CG to finish off.

While it wasn't too bad, she was nearly double my age which was a little off putting.

She shared the apartment with another WL but didnt get to see her. Anne said she is here once a month.

Yep that's it bobjon, you've jogged my memory. Her name is Anne and she does work from apt in Manuka. I thought (well, hoped more like it) she might be a bit younger than 50. You don't recall her rates do you? I'm a bit closer to her age than you and if the price is right ...

Her cracker ad says there is a website coming, I think I'll wait to see that before I have a punt.

(ad as appeared in Canberra times)



Hi all

Thought id take a punt on this WL whilst in Canberra town. She was convenient for me as I had a work function down the road. 20 min for $100. I’m sure she said her name was Sarah. Sarah to me is a curvy sz10. (I emphasise the word “curvy”). I wouldn’t call her slim but I wouldn’t call her fat or obese either. Tits are a good handful, around a d-cup id say. Has a nice tan, brunette curly hair with a kiwi accent, not a stunner but a friendly persona about her, looks early 30s.

Gave me her street address and to call when I am there for further details. When I got there I called and got the info and headed to her pad, she asked what I was wearing and said would meet me at the door of the large complex. No dramas. We met at the door, she led me to her pad which was literally 10 walk from the front entrance.

Started off with a very basic massage. Then, OMG, one of the hardest cock sucking I have experienced from a WL (CBJ). She really sucked so hard from the first second, that I thought about asking her to slow down, but then thought id just go with it. Wasn’t enjoying it totally initially as it was just full on from the get go, just tried to get used to it. Of course she wanted to fuck after a couple of minutes of head, but asked her to suck some more. After another 1-2 mins of blowie, she jumps on top, reverse cowgirl, and fucks at a feverish pace, no doubt trying to make me come quick.
Turn her over mish style with me standing and I pound away and blow soon after.

She has a buzzer set up and it went off at the 20 min mark on her alarm clock just as I had started to dress, so is not only a clock watcher a clock setter as well. The ferocious blowjob was interesting, but the whole session just didn’t do it for me to be honest. Lovely lady to chat with, but for me anyway I couldnt get into the punt at all. Physcially she didnt excite me a great deal and appeared a bit too mechanical for my liking. Other punters may differ though

overall 6/10

Classic review Steve. 

Thanks for sharing an interesting experience.

I thought this may have been another Sarah with NZ connections ( http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f30/sa...1-249-a-12317/ ) but since the phone numbers differ and you didn't mention this Sarah looked Maori, no.

I suppose the complete lack of interest in a sensual experience was what wrecked it. Bit of the old Wham-Bam-Thank you Sir !

She wouldnt pass as a moari to me, has caucasion looking face. Though on reflection she does have a thick body and booty, and of course the kiwi accent, so not too sure her exact heritage.

She should have a 15 min rate.
with bbbj/cim, it could be a money spinner for her.

No luck with this one unfortunately. 

Contacted her and she sent a decent pic (tanned blonde possibly late 20s')

Wanted to see her Sunday night and made a booking at 10pm, she kept postponing the first booking by saying she had guests at her house (relatives apparently). Texted back and forth saying they are still there. By midnight pretty much gave up and went for a punt at Exotics (see my 'Cali review') 

Contacted her again today, booked for 4pm. She texts me at 4pm when I got the address. Drove to the address and she texts on the way saying she is stuck at the hairdressers. Texted back and tried calling, unable to reach... no word. Drove past the house, car in the driveway. Curtains open. Parked a bit further out the house. Texted her said I was there. No word. Drove the block a couple times and even went for a bushwalk (!) around the corner to pass the time. Tried calling again. No answer. 

Scam alert I thought... I sent a text 'Scam?' Hoping it wasn't and waiting for a reaction. Still in the area around 5:30pm in the hope of hearing from her (booking was for 4pm!). Nada. 

On the way leaving the little town Queanbeyan I get a text from her. 'Scam? You rude dude (sic) I told you I'm at the hairdressers... bla bla blah'

Okey dokey. After flirty texts on the first attempt at a punt, the chick did a 360....A good punt with this is unlikely. Why wouldn't she pick up the phone. I assumed she doesn't speak English much or is a new foreigner? Busy at the hairdressers? Who knows. She seemed to have issues and a bit uppity. Well, her loss..she even doesn't know me and we have never seen or spoke. Just texts. 

Anyhoo...

I didn't want to knock on the door as the house without confirmation. It's exposed on an open cul de sac. 

Seems like a true ad maybe this chick is not fake... but is definitely A FLAKE and time waster.



I'm quite pragmatic with these Cracker privates so just took it with a grain of salt and went punting at Fyshwick  Had an awesome time

Just let this go everyone, it happened, just be aware that everything may not go well so put it down to experience.

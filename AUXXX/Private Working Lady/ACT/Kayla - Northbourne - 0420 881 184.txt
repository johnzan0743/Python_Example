My experience/comments : 

[COLOR=#5A5A5A]Hey guys. First review for me. I'm relatively new to the industry as a punter as this was my fourth punt.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#5A5A5A]So after being interested in Kayla's images and prices,[/COLOR][COLOR=#5A5A5A] I thought I'd like to check her out myself. Called her up to confirm her rates, $180 for 30 mins and $280 for the hour. Thought 30 minutes was a bit too short so I went with $280 for the hour.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#5A5A5A]Got to her place in Northbourne after being sent the address and I have to confirm that she's certainly beautiful for a young brunette, being tall with a nice slim body with curves at the right places and nice bust. Unfortunately, this was where things didn't quite live up to the expectations aside from myself, not being a DATY kind of person for safety reasons. Getting the obligatory introduction and shower out of the way, I decided to go with a massage for a start and while she certainly gets the job done, I would have liked a bit more of an effort to go with that such as the lack of a body slide which unfortunately she doesn't provide.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#5A5A5A]As far as the rest of the session goes, I felt the sex was decent with some nice foreplay but it did feel a bit mechanical despite changing in various positions (Cowgirl, Missionary, Doggy). Light Kissing here and there on the occasion however did make up for things a bit. Also, I was a bit disappointed that there weren't really any extras she offers and while I didn't ask for anal or natural services, I would have liked a bit of Spanish which she doesn't do alongside blowing my load on her body but otherwise, the whole experience was still alright at least, being friendly and still offering herself for the hour of decent fun. While YMMV, just don't expect the experience to be guaranteed intimate every time as for me, it was just a standard means to an end.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#5A5A5A]Furthermore, It's a shame I didn't finish in the hour due to my nerves and getting a leg cramp during the end of her providing me with a hand release but that's more my problem as I'm trying to fix my issue of not being able to "unload" outside of hand relief and getting the leg cramp sure made things worse for me. Would have been better otherwise. All in all, the session was decent fun to say the least despite I could have had a better punt elsewhere than the standard service here. Also I have no regrets as her friendly and light personality quite made up for the lack of intimacy, effort and options available during the session.[/COLOR]

^ It's a symptom that a person develops when they've masturbated too much with a hard grip over their hand, especially taking into account if they've done this in the past for a a few years or so. In effect, it reduces the sensitivity of the person's penis quite significantly that the frustration comes from only being able to feel pleasure by yourself and hardly being able to gain the same amount of pleasure or higher from a women in regards to intercourse and oral, considering that sex is not the same as pleasuring yourself in masturbation. 

In regards to a cure, using a lighter grip when masturbating, using a fleshlight or just stop masturbating entirely for a lengthy period of time, depending on how bad your DGS is would most likely get back sensitivity in the penis but otherwise, yeah, that's DGS for you.

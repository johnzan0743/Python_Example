 Nina - Manuka (Tour) - 0424 954 282
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name: Nina

Establishment : Private (working from Manuka)

Date of Visit: 6 May 2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 0424 954 282

Rates: Check at time of booking. They dropped them to 200half/300hr for single after arriving in Canberra. Personally, I think they're worth their normal Sydney prices.

Age: 24

Size/shape: 8, athletic and toned

Nationality or Ethnicity: British born with Caribbean heritage... and it shows!

Services Provided: Full service

Value for money/recommend?: Absolutely on both counts. Fantastic.

My experience/comments:

So it was the end of a hard week and felt like unwinding. Decided to look at CT to see if Chloe Matthews was back on the scene when I came across this ad:

SEEKING FUN? saucy play sessions. Exotic English Caribbean Nina. Busty fun natural Jessica. Avail. solo and hot doubles. Call Nina 0424 954 282. Jessica 0450 236 414.

Now I've found CT a bit hazardous for picking where the girl doesn't have a website, and even then can be iffy. And experience has also told me "Exotic" is a euphemism often. So was with great trepidation that I gave this a try. Very pleased I did.

Both girls can do a double or work as a single and they were kind enough to let me meet them both to decide (some ladies insist on choosing before arrival). Not only that, we all had the most wonderful, natural conservation for 10mins. Genuine interest on both parts and wasn't part of the booking, nor had I even committed to staying yet. Just talking about Canberra, Uni and work.

Both girls are stunningly attractive, I do mean model material. And I was so pleased that they weren't just pretty faces. Both are well educated, wonderful conversationalists and Jessica is a post-grad with the most awesome, sweet girl next door look, yet a vixenish quality too.

Short on time I went with half an hour with Nina. Her beautiful exotic look just gave her the edge over Jessica for my mood at the time. If they are back in Canberra will definitely do a double.

Shower, some wonderful foreplay with body slide and CBJ. Couldn't wait any longer and into mish for an all too brief effort on my part. It was uncharacteristic and though I managed to extend it a bit by burring my head in the pillow next to her, I couldn't resist looking at her again which pushed it over the line. Those eyes and that skin... wow.

With 10mins to go, we talked for a while. She is great to talk to and admits she can go on for quite a while, indeed we went over time. Nina is a beautiful, articulate and ambitious lady so guys, treat her and Jessica with respect, they deserve it.

A couple of points though. She was a bit trigger happy with the lube, though it didn't do anything negative for me and was likely because I was quite eager to pounce so she was doing it quick. Also, she does wear perfume, very nice too, but for the married men out there, could need explaining. That said, most ladies do use perfume.

Fantastic time, fantastic lady, ladies even, and will definitely be back to see them IF they come back. It is so rare in ANY context to find such a great mix of brains and sexuality.

Thanks cspan - a good find and top marks to you sir. I saw that ad and wondered. Radar set for next time they're in town. What are their Sydney prices just out of curiosity?

thanks. Not sure actually about the Sydney situation or even how often they work. Both have other jobs and seem to do this only occasionally. When they first came to Canberra though, Nina was about 450/hr, which is "high" but many touring girls charge that here. They dropped because so many people gave the a hard time on the phone, something I hear a lot even from top rated girls on PG for example. She did mention Canberra was proving a bit disappointing because of that, though she said some great guys had booked.

Sure. I didn't say much originally because while I saw her during chatting at the start... I didn't see all of her 
She's Kiwi, blonde, definitely curvier with a D to DD bust.  If I had to compare, not dissimilar to Kate Upton. I'll definitely see her next time to further my research.

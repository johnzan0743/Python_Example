 Girls from the CT
				
Post Content: 
Hey I was wondering if anyone had some advice for me.

I have been considering calling one of the girls who advertise in the Canberra Times and just had a few questions, hopefully for someone more experienced.

Firstly how are the girls, and how do they compare to the girls at establishments?

Secondly any general advice/etiquette or pitfalls I should avoid?

Thanks heaps.

As far as private ladies go - Aanie , Foxy Roxy and Ambrosia Rose have all been good value for me. Linda is ok - an older lady but you only pay $50 for 1/2 hr FS and I have always left with a bag of goodies - ( bottle of wine, chips or nuts and 2 cans of diet coke) - net cost $35.
 You can read reviews for them all here.

Regarding your behaviour, try to be a gentleman (that should be a given). Worst case scenario is that if she is rude in any way, shape or form you can't say that you contributed to her behaviour cos you're nice. 

Look at the toilet, shower and bedroom. If she is untidy in any way around these areas, you know ahe won't be fastidious in other more vital areas. 

Always know what you are buying into. Meaning if you have sexual preferences, try and get as much info before you part with your money. If you wanna say what you want in the meet,  be nice about declaring them. 

You're gonna have natural deal breakers so if she aint gonna be down with the program, walk away immediately.

Saw Mel today. Great massage - $100 for 1hr. You can choose a legit or a more sensual massage. Mel is an older lady who has a nice personality and chats a lot.
 A review will follow when I pay a second visit for a four hand massage.

Mel says she is 43 . Not an attractive lady. Happy ending is there and she does work nude. Also provides prostate stimulation if you want it. That makes for a fairly intense orgasm.

Hi jd316,

It would be great of we could get a full review in a new thread. This thread seems to have got off track and is more about Mel than anything.

Cheers,

BAB

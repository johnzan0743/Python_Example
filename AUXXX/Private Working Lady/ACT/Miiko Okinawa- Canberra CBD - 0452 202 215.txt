My experience/comments:

The appointment was easily made with the pimp via text. I didn't expect to see the Japanese girl in the photos for this price. Door opened, a petite decent looking Chinese girl emerged.
She was a bit shy and was told it was her 4th day in the Canberra. Then the usual finance and shower, onto BBBJ straight away, she did a decent job. Her English is very poor, but once she understood what I wanted, she gave a good effort.
Her face and body are a bit flat like most Chinese girls, I would give it 6 out of 10, but for the price, it is what you would expect anyway. 

WIR? not in a hurry, but definitely good enough for a return at some point when I am bored.

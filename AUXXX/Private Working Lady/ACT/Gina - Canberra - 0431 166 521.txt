She seems to have a very pronounced pussy.
Perhaps there's a small cock tucked away behind that mound.

Thanks for the warning Snapper79.  At least she seemed to be female.
There's another WL offering BBFS with fake pics on the same website, any chance of paying her a visit to see how far removed from reality her photos are?

Mongolian and Ukranian seems an odd mix ... but then again Ghengis Khan did pass through the Black sea region.

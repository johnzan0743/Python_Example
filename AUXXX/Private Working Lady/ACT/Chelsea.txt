 Chelsea
				
Post Content: 
"Chelsea" from PrivateGirls is coming to Canberra next week. I've had my eye on her ad for a while but doing some Google searches has turned up some interesting things.

On PG: She's a brunette, age 35, 167cm and charges $350/hr.

Google though turned up another ad on xxxAUS with the same bio, phone number, name and email but has her as a blonde, 23, 152cm. The pictures look nothing like her PG ad (triple the bust size) and the price is $450/hr.

And just to confuse further, I found she has a second ad on PG and a website under the name Alexia for $350/hr. Tour dates for June so it's not an old ad and the photos are similar but with shorter hair.

So has anyone seen her? And do these signs indicate I should save my cash and stay away? Something doesn't feel right.

I think I may have an explanation for your confusion cspan.

This girl on PG is Chelsea, also known as Chelsea Raine who tours Canberra regularly. She is in her mid 30s and is a brunette. Her pics are genuine and she is touring Canberra next week.

This girl on PG is Alexia and is not even closely related to Chelsea as far as I can tell. Her phone number is different, she looks different, she has much bigger breasts than Chelsea, has a different bio, there is a review of her on her PG listing, she has a completely different price structure and there are any number of other differences. So I'm struggling to work out how you've come to conclude she and Chelsea are one and the same person.

But the ad for this girl, on xxxaus is quite probably a badly done fake or a stuff up. The photo is of Chelsea and is clearly stolen form PG. The bio is also taken from PG and the phone number is Chelsea's. But the description on the right is of someone else; someone who is clearly not Chelsea. And the services offered are not what Chelsea offers. What makes me think it is a stuff up is that the phone number is Chelsea's. Why try to pass yourself as someone else and put in the contact details of the person you are impersonating. Doh! Not to mention claiming to be blonmd and posting a pic of a brunette.

Long story short cspan, the Chelsea on PG who says she is touring Canberra next week is Chelsea and she is touring Canberra.

This was the very confusing one: Contact Alexia - Sexy Sydney Escort | Private Chelsea Escorts
Private Chelsea website but content for Alexia. Also amazing how Chelsea and Alexia have near identical poses on a mirror from behind.

Yeah, the shot from behind on the mirror had me going for a minute too but definitely different girls. And both very hot. Love sexy brunettes in their sexual prime mid-30s.

As for this site for Alexia, which is confusing, maybe the answer is that Alexia, who is on PG as a Sydney Escort, used to be based in Perth and went by the name of Chelsea. I think maybe her old site just hasn't been updated properly and still uses the 'chelsea' domain name. Either that or this site is for neither Chelsea nor Alexia but someone else who is a scammer. I'd stick with PG.

And if after all this you do happen to see Chelsea next week, don't forget to report back. Her PG profile has PG's 'Five Star Gold Verified' banner which I believe is a very reliable verification from the PG owner.

Not that it matters, but I don't think it's a real mirror. It looks like a Photoshop effect to me.

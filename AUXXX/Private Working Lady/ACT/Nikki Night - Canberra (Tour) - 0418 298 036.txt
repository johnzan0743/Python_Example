My experience/comments : Christmas was around the corner so I thought I'd treat myself by being a bit different this time. Usually hit CT to see what's around but decided I might give a girl off Private Girls a go. Not many girls were touring sadly so was very limited to who I could see so I decided on Nikki Night. Called, setup a time, asked for extras which included Anal for $100 so I thought why not. Went to her place and she opened the door and tbh I was fairly disappointed. She has a very fit body but the face didn't do it for me, plus she had been badly sunburnt so had skin peeling from her face, back and arms....
However she has a very warm personality so I really couldn't say no so just went with the flow. Got the basics out of the way (but decided against Anal which was good because I don't think she realised I had agreed to it) and got down to business. Started with some very light kissing and after a few minutes she decides to go into 69. Now this is when shit got weird for me personally. While me going down on her, she decided to do her bit on me however after every 4-5 sucks she'd stop for like a minute and just tap on my penis...I have no fucking idea what's going and she continues this for a good 5-10 minutes. While me going down on her she would also annoyingly say every 30 seconds "That's good baby" which just threw me off and that was pretty much the end of me. Knew I wouldn't get far with this girl although still tried to fuck her in various positions just out of courtesy (I don't know) and just made up an excuse that I have been really stressed and just couldn't do it as I was not mentally there.
It's very possible I just caught her on her bad day, and considering her sunburns this is very likely. On the plus side she is good to talk to and is intelligent so she might be different for other men. Anyway not really money well spent and really disappointed considering some of the girls who advertise on PG.

Thank you for your review expen9020.

CT means "Canberra Times" right, so you saw her in Canberra. 

What was the venue ?

Thanks for the review. 
Its a pity about the sunburn though.
I've noticed there's a few nice girls in town at the moment.

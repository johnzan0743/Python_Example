 Gabriella Kelly - Canberra (Tour) - 0424 015 128
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name:  Gabriella Kelly

Establishment :  Private

Date of Visit:  15 May 2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink:  

Hours of Business:   0424 015 128 | www.gabriellakelly.net

Rates: 180/300... well that's how it starts, you'll find it's more once you arrived

Age:  "29"... again, you'll find it's more once you arrive

Size/shape:  Short, petite

Nationality or Ethnicity:  Australian

Services Provided:  Anyone's guess, what was on and off the menu changed every few minutes

Value for money/recommend?:  Not at all, avoid. So many better offerings out there.

My experience/comments: Absolutely terrible on all counts. Her photos shown on her website and Cracker are a testament to good lighting, lens choice and in all probability the infamous "pixel warp" brush used by fashion editors to slim models... only in this case, obviously used to add some bulk. 

Working from the James Court, it was a nice convenient location. And luckily the Maccas down stairs provides a useful place to wait out of the bitter cold, because wait you will. Twice in fact, each time with an explanation offered only after a process of txts more painful and time consuming the pulling a tooth. First time it was forgot and made another booking. Next time, it was staff on her case.

Despite the run around, I had already invested much time in waiting both times and so waited the second time before finally meeting her. Instant regret. The biggest clue was she hid behind the door in a manner I've not seen before... completely behind it and almost crushing herself with it. Should have prompted me to run right then. The cold though had made me numb and I continued. I wanted something for the time and effort.

It was at this point she messed me around on price, quoting it double what she had earlier said, then halving that and then halving it again as I assured her the locals don't look kindly on being switcharood at the last minute.
Clothes off, quick massage with happy ending and done. So not a total loss. Put simply, the deed was done.
Her attitude though was poor, almost like a robot except all that circuitry in real robots would make them warmer.
He pics though are grossly misleading, she is easily late thirties. She also had a bottle of beer almost finished and the place smelt like a brewery... and it wasn't late even.

Do yourself a favour gentlemen, go see Amber or Chloe or if you actually want a slightly more mature lady, Roxy if this ad ever tempts you. You'll thank yourself... I wish I had.

Sorry to hear you had such a dreadful experience. She sounds like a rather unprofessional WL with misleading advertising. Thanks for the heads-up. Hope your next punt is a major improvement!

Thanks for the heads up.   I'd just touched base with her looking at trying to hook up on Sunday.   Think I'll now give her a big miss.   Such a shame as on her website she looks fantastic.   A few of her testimonials seemed good too but I think I'll take my hard earned $$$ elsewhere.

Just a quickie....do you know if she offers BBBJ??

Her photo is exactly the same as the one used by Tina from Stiletto, Ladies - Stiletto Sydney Brothel. Me they may be the one & the same person.

Interesting, I used TinEye on her photos and didn't find any duplicates. Well spotted Westy.
If you click on Availability on the Stiletto website, it says she is available in Sydney on Sunday 29 May. The Gabriella website however says she's in Canberra until 30 May. So if they are the same person, either the roster is wrong on one site or the other or she transcends time and space. More likely though she ripped the pics off.

Also the Gabriella website is a template site, you can check the source code and it has the copyright of where she got it from.

As for BBBJ, who knows. She said she only plays safe but also said Cum on Face and Cum on Pussy were available as extras. The price of which changed ever few minutes, with her going "oh, that's right it was..."

Tina from Stiletto is an American girl, so She is NOT Aussie. those pictures are also stolen from blackfeather.com (Danielle) which is also owed by Stiletto and which Tina is Danielle.

Whoever this Gabriella is she is going to have to take those pictures down.

This is most interesting, I saw her in wollongong about 3 months ago. I thought the photos were very close but I am unable to say if they are actually anybody else or not. The service I got started out with a nice massage, BBBJ with some end of the bed deep throating. There was a reason I could not do DATY that seemed somewhat reasonable at the time. I was able to finger her pussy and ass, with her advising me not to insert and reinsert from orifice to the other. She frigged herself for me and squirted, that was fun. We then bonked in a couple of positions, cow girl, reverse cow girl, lots of encouragement from her to enjoy myself. There was never any pressure to upgrade or purchase extras.  overall its was all good, but while she is currently back in the Gong this week i did give it a moments thought to revisit her but on second thoughts I did not really click with her.

Are you sure your talking about the right Gabriella Kelly?? I had a totally different experience with the gorgeous Gabriella, she was absolutely hands on and very attentive to my needs. And drop dead gorgeous, and she explained to me the bottle of beer was massage oil, which she did lavish all over my body so sensual!

Beer... as massage oil... really? There is such a thing but it's done with proper massage oil infused with aromatic hops.
Or do you mean the beer bottle was just used to hold massage oil? That wouldn't make much sense since a beer bottle once open has no lid. And aside from the smell of beer, the liquid inside sure looked like Corona Extra as per the label. When she went for the oil, she went for a click top bottle of the stuff anyway.

Hi cspan

Gabriella Kelly's website photos are really of Tina of Stiletto.  They are a direct rip off from Stiletto's website.  The images are really Tina.  No wonder you were disappointed!

working at Stiletto and Black Feather, I can confirm 100% that Gabriella Kelly's photos are fraudulent, directly ripped off from Tina at Stiletto.  And Danielle from Black Feather.  I have been trying to get Gabriella to take these photos down from her website.  It pisses me off that girls do this, it ruins punting for everyone.   Tina is in fact an Australian girl and immaculate.  (it is Jamie that is from the States). 

In any event, Stiletto and Black feather are now putting watermarks over our images so they cannot be ripped off by any other private girls.  It seems to be happening all the more frequently.  Don't be fooled again!

I talked to her on the phone the first time she came to town Oct last year. She sounded very pleasant and but never got the chance to see her in the end. I've tried to book subsequent times and each time, she either doesn't answer her phone ever or the automated message says her phone service is suspended.
Sounded to me like a nice woman but a few financial issues looking back at our conversation and subsequent difficulties.

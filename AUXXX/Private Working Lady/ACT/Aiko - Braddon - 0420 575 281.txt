Person's Name: AIKO

Hours of Business: No Idea (CT Advert)

Rates: $100 30min/ 180 1hour

Age: 45+

Size/shape: Thin and Well Used

Nationality or Ethnicity: Asian of some sort, definitely not Japanese

Services Provided: I Left

Value for money/recommend?: Not Likely

My experience/comments:
Advert reads: AIKO JAPANESE20yo, cute, sz 6, perfect body, very pretty, warm and sensual. 1st time in Braddon.
Woman greeted me a the door (with her hidden behind it). I walk in, she had to be 45 if she was a day. The room stank of cigarettes and so did she. 
Face was haggard, was wearing a see through top that showed very time worn body.
She asked if I wanted 30 or 60 min. I just said no thanks, your Ad was very misleading and you are not what I am looking for.
She then said she was splitting 50/50 with her friend next door and would I like her instead. I said no and left.
Not much of a review I know, but I wouldn't have put my worst enemies dick in that, let alone my own.

The line in the CT ad that says "1st time in Braddon" sets alarm bells ringing for me.

Just today for example there's the aforementioned Aiko and Ann Chinese Babe. There have been others recently and there will be more in future. Beware.

No - fine review, you've said it as you saw it, you were smart enough to walk (in a polite way "I just said no thanks, your Ad was very misleading and you are not what I am looking for"   - I wish I had such presence of mind), and you have warned the punting public.

Well done.

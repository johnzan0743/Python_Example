The photos are more than likely not her. Tineye gives a photo result for this site: www.ghostbabes.com
If anyone can be bothered looking, they'll find Sexy Alanna in there somewhere.

9 different ads all appeared on Cracker for the ACT at the exact same time on Sunday, all for implausibly "model" looking women and with similarities in formatting (e.g. writing "<<" before the price.)
Taylor, Holly, Skylar, Stella, Yvette, Anita, Summer and another Holly. Another one appeared shortly after for Lara who uses illustrative pics, (which her profile openly said on PrivateGirls so credit to them for being honest about that). I don't think they're legit ads so tread with caution.

Agreed cspan, it is just such an impausibly remote conincidence that all these girls would turn up in Canberra in the same week that it is hard not to conclude that they are in fact the one and the same fake with a collection of mobile phones.

Why these ads are odd is that Federal Parliment is not sitting.

That may be so Minerva1 but the main reason these ads are odd is that they are fake. There are in fact touring WLs who avoid Canberra in parliament sitting weeks because there are too many fly by nighters coming out of the woodwork in those weeks and they don't want to get lumped in with the chaff.

Well, was hoping to have been able to write a review but she's cancelled her tour 5 times to Canberra in the last 3 months. What's interesting is she offers a special if you prepay... wonder what happens if you do?

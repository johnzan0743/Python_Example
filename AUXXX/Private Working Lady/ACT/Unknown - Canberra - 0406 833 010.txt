Called this ad in the CT last night:
"ABSOLUTELY    Stunning Japanese Doll, Size 8, model figure, classy, good service and  massage.    In/out 24hrs.0406 833 010"
$110/30min, $30 extra for bbbj.

Didn't go as I asked over the phone what her age was, 25 was the answer.  NOT!

more around 30-35.

maybe I'm picky, but looks about 5/10.  slim, but not great body.

I tried my luck somewhere else.

My experience/comments : Saw this ad on Canberra times and seeing as I haven't been with a Japanese woman before I thought I'd give this one a try. Upon seeing her I could swear she was not Japanese at all and had real Chinese look about her but I let this pass. As we got the monies and shower out of the way I head into her bedroom noticing a strong cigarette smell. Again it was one of those things that doesn't bother me greatly so I let it pass. So we start with the action and she goes down for a CBJ. She does quite well here as she starts off slowly and then goes deeper for a some deep throat action and this was probably the best part of it. After some BJ she went on top and moved in for some light kissing but the strong cigarette smell from her mouth made turned me off so I begin to kiss her neck to move me away from the smell. After that it was a struggle to finish off so she decided to give me a hand job after a while to completion. All in all not the greatest of experiences and I'm definitely sure she is not Japanese as stated on the ad.

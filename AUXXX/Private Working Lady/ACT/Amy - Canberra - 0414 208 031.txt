Post Content: 
Establishment and/or person's Name: Amy

Contact Details/Address: Advertised in CT along with Bea. The ad mentioned doubles and extras. 0414208031

Prices: $110/half

Age: Mid 20s

Size/shape: Slender with big Boobs and a pretty face. Quite hot actually.

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai

Services: Many promised but didn't do anything (see below) - FS

Value for money/recommend ? Big No

My experience: This punt shoud've set off alarm bells from the beginning. I called the number in the CT, the ad was something along the lines of: "Amy and Bea hot asian girls v busty doubles and extras etc". The woman on the phone sounded OLD and was clearly a mamasan though she was talking as if she was the WL. First alarm bell. She promised the world extras wise (or at least promised DFK and DATY) and didn't mention prices. Second alarm bell. Anyway, I made a booking and was told to go to the Argyle Apartments (that place again). When I was met by the girl she spoke almost no English though she was quite attractive. In the room it immediately became apparent that she didn't want to be there and didn't allow DFK and only let me DATY for about 10 seconds before she wanted to move to sex. I was so put off by the cold experience that I just went for hand relief to finish me off. Money down the toilet. I wish I could be more forthcoming about names and numbers but I suspect that this little operation changes ads, names and numbers almost weekly so I'd be wary (or wary-er) of taking a punt on asian girls in the CT where the person on the phone is clearly a mamasan.

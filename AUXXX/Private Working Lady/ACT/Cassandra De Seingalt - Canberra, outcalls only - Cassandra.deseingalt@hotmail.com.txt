Greetings all

I've been eyeing these ads on Cracker (posted 17/01/2014) and twiddling my thumbs:
A Night All About You - Canberra | Escort / adult | Erotic | Cracker
Young Bisexual Escort - ACT | Escort / adult | Erotic | Cracker
Young, Sensual, Sexual and Interested in You - Canberra | Escort / adult | Erotic | Cracker

They're three slightly different ads from the same lady, calling herself Cassandra De Seingalt and claiming to be a 20-yr old student.  There is an e-mail address but no phone number listed -- she says she will supply that after you e-mail her.  She's just my type (tall and curvy) but only does outcalls.  While I live alone and could theoretically see her at my place, I'm a bit wary of doing so.  But am tempted to maybe meet her elsewhere and get a general vibe.  

Her ads are marked as originating outside Australia so was a bit suspicious initially, though I've never quite been sure if that means the IP address used is foreign or if they just happen to have an overseas-based e-mail account -- any ideas?  However, she was quick to reply when I e-mailed her last month (but was just about to head overseas until mid-Jan and asked me to contact her around now), so she -- or at least somebody with access to that account -- does seem to exist.

First though I wondered whether anybody here had seen her already (couldn't find any reviews).  And what your thoughts are in general about incalls to your home from strange women...!

Cheers

Hi Lustvader, just a quick observation.  Most cracker ads seem to originate from oveseas, so without claiming to be an expert I suspect its got something to do with remore servers and ISPs rather than Russian mafia.

And a point of order, incall is where you visit the girl, outcall is where she visits you.  So this girl is offering outcalls, not incalls.

cheers

Thanks, emp, and sorry, yes meant to say outcalls.  Perhaps a mod would be kind enough to correct my mistake in the title and body of my post.  Thx

Sounds very interesting, but outcalls only so I won't be the one to TOFTT

I go to Canberra on business sometimes. If I have the cash I'll give her a shot. And a bit of trivia ... Casanova's full name was Jacques Casanova de Seingalt.

Hello,

My name is Cassandra and I wish to offer you night that is entirely about you. Your wants, needs, ideas and passions are what I wish to focus on. I love sharing love and nothing brings me more joy than a partner enjoying themselves. I am absolutely discreet and hope that you'll return the favour.

So a little about me, I am 20 years old, a student and a tutor. Other passions of mine include politics, travel, reading but above all sensuality and sexuality. I am very tall, 6'1 in fact, a 16DD with exquisite curves to match, short red hair and bright blue eyes.

I enjoy making my session about more than just the service though. I'd love to get to know you, to talk some, to know you for who you are and what you want exactly. I am a trained masseuse and offer this with any session, your pleasure and relaxation are paramount to me. I am willing to offer most services just discuss them with me before hand and we'll work out exactly what I can do for you. The one thing I do not offer is anal and condoms are a must for me. I do not have a private residence but am willing and able to travel to you, anywhere in the Canberra region.

If you are interested in a relaxed but passionate evening, Please send me a courteous and intelligent email to find out what I can do for you and to receive my contact number.

XoXo
Cassandra De Seingalt

I booked Cassandra for tomorrow night but she just emailed me to say she is sick and has to cancel. I appreciate the notice. That's probably Gen-X for she has had a better offer to play x-box with someone.  Not that I care but I'll book her again next time in town and let you blokes know.

Thanks, mate, that's too bad but a good sign with the early notice of cancellation; would be interested to know how you go if you manage to hook up with her on your next visit.

Btw, as a purported 20-yr old, she would be Gen Y (I'm a Gen X and an Xbox to me is where X marks the spot in a FS session).

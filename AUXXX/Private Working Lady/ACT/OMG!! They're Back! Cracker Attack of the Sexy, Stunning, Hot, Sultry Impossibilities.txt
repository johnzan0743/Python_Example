 OMG!! They're Back! Cracker Attack of the Sexy, Stunning, Hot, Sultry Impossibilities
				
Post Content: 
Recalling this thread I see from Cracker's Canberra page today that They're Back!! Ads posted on Cracker all at the same time, all about the same age with implausibly model looks all arrive in town all at once. As if!

This time they are Sexy Dana, Stunning Stella, Hot Sexy Yvette, Sexy Holly, Sexy Maya, Sultry Bombshell Tiffany (whose pics are labelled Danielle) and Young Elle.

Quickly found pics purporting to be Stella and Yvette are actually iStock lingerie model stock pics. Then I got bored and gave up the detective work.

Go see Katie Kennedy mate. She's legit (review coming) and just as hot as the babes in those fake ads (which are also on privategirls.com.au, so much for thinking that site could always be trusted).

Old thread, but thought I would update.

Saw 'Rachel' from one of these ads. I have also seen the same ad on privategirls.

Wasn't same super sexy girl as in the pics, but she was close to the pics and a very good experience, and she was in the nicest/newest appt I have ever seen!

Link is here to my recent review:

Thanks, could you post links to either/both ads?

I haven't been able to find the ads on Cracker again by scrolling back in time. They must expire them? 

I wouldn't be surprised with parliament sitting soon, that these ads appear again. They have not been around for the last month or so. But it was definitely the 'Rachel' ad I have seen a lot of times over the last year, that I rang.

I think they do clean up if the advert is not renewed. You can always try searching under name or mobile number and see if anything shows up. As this was from 2011 they most likely have moved on.

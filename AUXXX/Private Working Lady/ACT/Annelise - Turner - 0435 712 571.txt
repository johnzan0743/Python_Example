CT Advt: BOLLYWOOD ARRIVES Swimsuit model, indescribable beauty, beautifully tanned, bikini body, with a natural firm extremely large bust, high class, clean living.Ph 0435 712 571

She charges $130 for 30 mins and $250 for one hour. She operates from an apartment in Turner. She is South African with some Indian in the mix. She said that she was 27yo over the phone but I'd say 40s. Not size 8 like she claims. Short and size 12ish. Has a big tummy with the saggy bits forming a fold over her lady bits.  Nothing to describe as beauty is what the ad should read. She is tanned and has a large set of lungs. 

Booked for 30 mins. When inside the room she started the spiel of $130 for massage and sex...$150 for oral, massage and sex....$200 for oral, spanish, massage and sex. I settled for the $130 shag only bargain. She kept selling the $150 option as I did not bring exact change but I declined the offer. She did a quick cbj anyway...there was no way she could have coaxed me with sensuality alone! Then gave a vigorous hj...wtf? Anyways moved on to mish and she put on the expression of having a sack of dirt being slowly smeared all over her rotund body followed up with a few 'hurry up' thrusts of her hips. Got over the line swiftly as this is my first punt after a sabbatical of sorts. She rolls off the bed and gets herself cleaned and thanks me....with 20 minutes still remaining on the clock. She jumps in the shower to clean herself and I dress up as I did not want to wait around for my shower. She comes out and says it is a busy day for the girls working in that house! So maybe the other 'Indian' currently advertising in the CT operates out of there too. But I wouldn't bother trying to find out with the misleading advts being placed. So at $13 per minute I might as well have spent my time smearing dirt all over that rotund body

Needless to say this is my TOFTT punt for April

Moral of the story, never go with an advert that claims to be a swimsuit or lingerie model. If they really are, then they don't tour to Canberra anyway and charge a heap more.

Post Content: 
Person's Name : ACOCO

Establishment : Private

Date of Visit : Jan 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0435 903 426

Hours of Business : I visited during day

Rates : $120 half

Age : 18 in ad but def older

Size/shape : Very Small size 5, small boobs

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

Services Provided : Full

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : I saw ACOCO at Lynham Motel Inn which is a little dingy, She can hardly speak English. Service was rushed and unpleasant, she has no interest at all.

Ok, I arrived and parked just outside the apartment door. She opened wearing a little outfit and did not say much. I had a cold shower and noticed no towel and the floor towel was soaked. I entered the room and there was a towel on the double bed, another single bed was near but was un made.

She asked me to lay down and went straight to blow with condom (not too bad but Ive had much better), she then got straight on and started riding really quickly to try and make me come. I requested another position and I went on top, she again hooked her feet in and made it all quick trying to finish. No kissing allowed as I tried. Eventually I gave up trying to have a good time, finished up showered again and left.

Here's the CT ad

ACOCO JAPANESE 18yo, princess, tiny perfect body, new Lyneham. 0435 903 426.

Thanks for  taking one for the team and saving us all from a bad time.

  Messy surroundings,
  No connection,
  No interest,
  No fun.

Probably leave feeling bad and ripped off. 

How can women who operate like this enter the industry or stay in it ?

Sympathy bro.

Sex trafficking perhaps? Otherwise, thanks for taking one for the team TC. No wonder it's called the Canberra "pot luck" times with false advertising and hardly genuine effort at times with such particular WLs.

Have to agree with Ironmanii,
I had pretty much the same experience. 
Wet floor, dingy room, no working ac
Though the hot water worked fine for me.
I actually laid down with her and chatted first as I had booked an hour.
I found out that her English was actually much better than I first thought, but she was very embarrassed about it.
Still wouldn't go back as she had zero interest and that is a real turn off

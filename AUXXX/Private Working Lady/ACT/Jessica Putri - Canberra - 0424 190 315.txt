The short answer, I have not seen her.
I was interested, and did some research - her website is http://www.jessicaputri.com/
Interestingly, face shots only, no body shots. Vic laws have something to do with this I am sure.
After trawling some forums, found some reviews buried in SDU. This is hearsay, but as of mid last year (last review), she was not recommended.
A pity - a very pretty face, and the price is right.

Same here, she never replies or answers her phone. Something suss by all accounts.

My experience/comments:
 I was visiting Canberra and was looking through Cracker to see what was around. I came upon the link above and she looked nice. A call and two texts later I was visiting. She was at the Argyle Apartments.

I rolled up at the correct time and was given the apartment number. Ade opened the door.

Very Dissappinted. Ade was not the girl of your dreams. Or the girl in the pictures. Instead of being curvy, busty and a round face. I was met by a gaunt, skinny girl with no breasts and no arse. She looked as if she was a couple of grains short of a bag of Ice.

I said to her. "Where is Ade?". No answer and no interest.

I turned on my heels and left. Not interested in doing the deed with a girl who ticked none of the boxes from the girl on the add. So much promise and then a complete disappointment. I had wasted a lot of my time. Therefore the meaning of WOFTAM. Waste of fucking time and money.

See ya fellas.

A very common happening at Argyle and Monterey in Reid....there are LOTS of girls working there and WOFTAM / Switcheroo is common.....I am reluctant to go there.....I have also noticed that the "Back Page" ads have a lot of similarity. I get the impression that there is a management group running most of the girls.

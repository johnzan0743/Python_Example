Hi legs. I'm intrigued. You post here that you are the girl in the gb. Fine. But many of your posts are reviews of girls as if you were a bloke. So I'm starting to think that most if not all of those reviews are self promoting. So e are even signed off as Sarah. Can you explain please? I'm a bit dim

emp, I think it's just some sloppy formatting.  Legs has pasted an ad from cracker after his question ending '???'.  I'd noticed it yesterday that's why I recognise it. Here's the link: GANG BANG WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT - Canberra | Escort / adult | Erotic | Cracker

I looked up the Sarah (Turner) thread and that post (#17) also I suspect is a copy and paste after the '.....' from an e-mail or text, rather than Legs signing off as Sarah.

Hey Legs, just a suggestion: use quotes to avoid such misunderstandings!

There is a local blonde who advertise in lots different ads, including for example
INCREDIBLE BJ SERVICE $120
And
You are under arrest
Etc 
I suspect it's here
Anyway, I've sent email coz gangbang in canberra seems a rare opportunity

Pretty much all ads have this... to do with the location of the hosting server or something

A sausage fest isn't my thing but am curious if anyone from here attended on either night, and if so, any chance of a review or report?

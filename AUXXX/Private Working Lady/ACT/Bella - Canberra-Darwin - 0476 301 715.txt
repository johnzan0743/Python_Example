My experience/comments : Bella was touring from Darwin and I was just lucky to check the ads the day before she left Canberra. Short notice but she was able to fit me in and I met her at her hotel a few hours later. Honestly I wasn't blown away by her initial appearance, which I would describe as plain - not as a euphemism for ugly, just ordinary looking - but the more time I spent in her company the more I enjoyed myself. It was near the end of the week and I was pretty tired so we didn't have sex (from memory I initially paid $200 for a hour massage rather than the FS rate, but left a tip for going overtime and some extras). But I had a great time with her just touching, kissing and talking - she is a lovely girl next door type of personality, but with way more dirty stories! Time was not rushed at all, and she seemed to genuinely enjoy her work. Hope she makes another trip down south. She has ads up for phone sex as well so might try that sometime.

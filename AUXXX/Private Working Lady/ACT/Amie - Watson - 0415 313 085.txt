 Amie - Watson - 0415 313 085
				
Post Content: 
Establishment and/or person's Name: Amy

Contact Details/Address: 0415 313 085

Hours of Business: Don't know - in Canberra for at least another week.

Prices: $200 / hr

Age:  Early 20's

Size/shape: Slim, medium height, small but lovely and responsive breasts.

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese (Singaporean?)

Services: FS, CBJ

Value for money/recommend?: Yes, definitely

My experience/comments:  The ad in the CT says:
"AMY New 20 yo, sz 6, tanned firm body, very pretty, sexy"

I have no reason to dispute any of that. Amy has a lovely body, an interesting but pleasant face, and an intelligent and friendly manner. The struck up a rapport, maybe helped by my giving her a massage, which she seemed to relax into. The CBJ was very nice, and the sex was willing and fulfilling. Then there was round 2, which was just as good, where I was more passive, and Amy was more active.

It was a pleasure to have the door opened who was exactly as described, and pleasant company to boot. A better punt than my last (see prior review), for significantly less $$

Seriously considering a revisit before she leaves!

Was feeling restless today and knew that I would end up punting....by habit! Had a browse of the CT and it was a toss up between Oz Raunchy Renee and Amie from Singapore! I had called Renee the last time she had advertised a few weeks ago and she said she provided natural french and anything that you wanted in your time with her. She quoted $150 for 30 mins and $250 for one hour. Although it sounded very promising I didn't follow up then. Today I called Amie and she sounded very polite and young and from recent experience I've learnt that there are a lot of young asian wl's coming to Canberra for a few weeks and these girls are genuine to their ads. I guess its to do with Uni and CIT closing for the year. So was off to see Amie. She operates out of a small motel in Watson and Charges $100 for 30 mins and $200 for an hour. The motel is not one of the usual wl haunts and the time that I got there was peak housekeeping time and house keepers were teeming around the place  armed with their trolleys and accusing looks. Having given away my cover I made a dash for the room and was pleasantly surprised to see a really good looking young girl. She does not have the usual thai wl look but has a different asian student look and is quite good looking and is almost certainly a novice. She was not dressed in a sexy outfit but in a regular black dress. I paid for 30 mins and she started undressing. She is about 5' 8" and has c cup breasts with big nipples. She has a slim figure but is not a bag of bones. She had every light in the room turned on and this further confirmed my impression that she was a novice. But even with all the light her skin was flawless and her body remarkable. 

She started kissing me as I lay on the bed. She did it like it was a procedure that had to be ticked off before the next could commence. She ticked off the boxes for kissing the neck and torso and after skipping the pelvis she went to kissing the legs. Then I dragged her up and had her lying on her back while I caressed and kissed her torso! As I moved lower she was alarmed and grabbed a dom as she did not want unprotected pelvic contact. So I was kneeling on the bed and she got the dom on and put her head down between my knees and started sucking. She then lay down and continued while I bent over her body and caressed her back and tight butt. Her body had a freshness that comes with youth and to her this was still real sex and not role play. The cbj was amazingly delivered with conviction. She had me close to the brink and so we tried mish and it was beautiful to watch her freshness. She played with her clit as I climaxed.  She seemed genuinely disappointed that I had cum....already...and held me and kept rubbing my body with her hands. This however felt like another box that she had to tick. She pulled out a box's worth of tissues to clean me up and asked me if I wanted to shower. I was sure I was only half way through with time. But she provided a genuine service so I believed that she did not know how stuff works with punters and time. So, I gladly jumped in the shower and after asking her a bit about herself I left with 10 mins still remaining on the clock. It was a good experience as I genuinely felt that she was a regular girl giving this a go. The downside is that although I did not get a look at it she seems to have some kind of prolapse.

I am sure this is the same Amie (Amy) I reviewed a few weeks ago - certainly the same phone number. From my limited pre-punt research, she was working up in Queensland earlier this year, but that's all I know. Probably not been working too long, as you suggested.

Here time management with me was somewhat better, although she was late for our first appointment. I had one really good punt with her, then the second was a little of a let down - possibly too  much anticipation and expectation, or maybe my head was just in a different space.

Yes, it is the same Amie (Amy). Sorry I did not realise it when I posted. She did say that she was a student in Brisbane. I guess she has more to learn

Well, it's not as if both you lads don't know where to go if you're looking for a guaranteed thing. So, shouldn't it be half expected when you're disappointed, or it's decided that your expectations were held too high, by an unknown provider?

After all, isn't that half the 'thrill' of the the hunt? Here, you get to be the great explorer of some potential 'buried treasure'... or great dud! In a way, this scenario makes the name Captain Jack Sparrow even more fitting!

I guess that question is often in the back of my mind...
Support the local operator, or look for the occasional nugget of gold with a visiting lady - some of whom have no interest in encouraging you to a return visit, as they won't be in town anymore.
I have got to say, I usually (but not always) do better with the local ladies.

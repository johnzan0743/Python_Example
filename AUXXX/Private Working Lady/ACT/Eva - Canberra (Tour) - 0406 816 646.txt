I'm a little tight to pay $250 for half hr. I will but I'm always tentative.. And when I do I hate walking away thinking I wasted money.. Guess that's why it's called punting! There are plenty of 120-200 half hr punts who are good quality girls & you'll leave on a high or at least relaxed/smiling and thinking money well spent!

My view too. Here's an interesting alternative perspective, http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f100/l...tml#post107924

It surprised me so much that a lady would want to kiss a punter. 'Spose a few of them may turn into princes (as people may have thought in the less politically correct times before Maxwell's Demon).

Nevermind phenom, one of my more air-headed replies.

You can see the Wikipedia 'defer to big names for answer' description of it here, Maxwell's demon - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

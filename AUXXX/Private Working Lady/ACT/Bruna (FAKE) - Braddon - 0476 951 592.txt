Details:
Wanted to go Brazilian - should have known better - went to the location after contacting the number (most likely a digital Mama/Papasan who farms girls around) and saw that it wasn't what I was after.

Poor English skills compounded the frustration. As I turned to walk she offered via phone message a $100 service (discounted from $150).

No thanks. Walked.

She was pretty but I'm thinking she's a clock watcher that will simply go through the motions and churn through customers to earn a quick buck.

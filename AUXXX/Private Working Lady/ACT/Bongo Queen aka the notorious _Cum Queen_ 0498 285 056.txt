 Bongo Queen aka the notorious "Cum Queen" 0498 285 056
				
Post Content: 
Name: Bongo Queen

Location: camper van, various locations- Mitchell this time

Contact: 0498 285 056, call/SMS for hours of operation

Date: May 17

Age: 40+, Aussie

Size: 10, bolt on funbags (F's at least)

Services: CBJ, BBBJ, FS, CIM, Swallow, BBFS, Spanish

Price: $50 for the CBJ, incremental rises in $50 blocks

Summary: good to try, not to keep

So the cum queen has reinvented herself into a new being, but with the same service. Simple contact resulted in me ending up near the EPIC showground carparks. Yes it's as dodgy as it sounds. 

Into the compartment and the queen is in her chambers, nude and ready to go. Time certainly has not been kind to her, but from the neck down the chassis seems to be in good condition, much like a plastic fantastic sports car. The same "my husband's whore" tattoo emblazoned across the horizontal just above the pubic line.

Knowing that her husband is floating around the area, I opted for the BBBJ. She asks whether she could take photos of when she's gobbling me; I'm indifferent as long as I get my end in and no face pics.

She then unzips me as I lay on the cabin floor, and commences a rapid gobble gobble. Quite primal with plenty of slurping and gagging. It's as if she's on the clock and trying to get in the Guinness book of records for quickest BJ/CIM. Naturally I resist the urge to blow quickly and the strange sucking/coughing/gagging sensation continues on.

Whilst this goes on I try to stick a finger in her and play with her tits to add more playtime. About 10 mins passes and she asks between sucking and the selfie shots on whether I want more. Knowing that she's done BBFS and CIP I politely decline and ask her to continue blowing me. Not to mention that she's probably had more pricks than a used dartboard.

After a while longer the wave comes and I signal to her that I'm close. Not skipping a beat she quickens the pace and before long I coat the back of her throat with my swimmers. About 20 mins in all. Quick baby wipe clean up and $75 lighter in the pocket (all the cash I had on me), I'm on my merry way, balls emptied but with a strange emotion coming over me, feeling slightly weird about what just happened.

Not sure whether I'd go again, but I thought that last time as well. Does the trick.

So she works out of a motorhome, near NATEX?  Thats just getting toooo close for comfort for me, as you must have to park your own vehicle nearby as well. Too dangerous for this fella!

My experience/comments : 

Dire options in Canberra in general, was interested in her extremely explicit ad (cracker), more women should advertise spreadeagle. Texted her, contact was easy, saw her within the hour without waiting.

Arrived at a motel, she was at the door wearing nothing but a g-string. I thought she was pretty hot for her age. She asked how much I wanted to offer, I told her to tell me, $100 for bbbj, $150 for FS. Her ad offered creampie, before I had arrived I already decided to play it (relatively) safe and only do the BJ. Paid the hundred, as requested went to the bathroom and washed my cock.

Oh, and she warned me that, in the back of the motel room behind a barrier was a 'dog', and not to be disturbed if there's noise. I didn't give her warning any mind at the time, but reading other posts on this forum, suspicious it may have been her husband!

She started a passable blowjob, after about 1 minute she told me to put it in her and blow inside her. YOLO, I can't say no, in the heat of the moment I did it. No lie, her pussy felt fantastic. After I came, she pulled me out and sucked every last drop, a bit of post-orgasm torture, which I like.

She says she'll be in Canberra for a couple of months.

I really should sort out my life and stop doing this sort of thing. I keep getting away with it though, have trouble reconciling the dissonance between reported STD prevalence vs never catching anything/no negative consequences vs the terrible places I've been vs it feels great. This isn't even the riskiest thing I did this week.

Wow, just checked her Cracker ad..........she's got an awesome looking cunny. Looks like it'd be huge as well. Shame it's a petri dish and cant be licked and sucked......might end up with mouth sores that i couldn't explain. 

The story about the dog in the back of the room, reminds me of my best man years ago. He cracked onto an older women in a pub, when he was in his 20's, he reckons she was in her 40's at the time. Back then, to a 20 year old, that was a huge age gap. He went back to her place and was banging away in her bedroom and the husband/boyfriend was in the wardrobe, watching it all, with tool in hand. My buddy heard what he thought was coat hangers clanging and got up to open the door........the rest was history. He scarpered out of the place, never to see her again. 
Whatever gets you through the night eh? lol

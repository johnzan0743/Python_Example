My experience/comments : Last year I caught up with Ruby Wild on tour. Booking for 1-hour massage was straightforward and she responded via  text fairly quickly. Cost was $200 at the time but she seems to be  charging $250 now. I was directed to a serviced apartment in town and  was met in the lobby by Ruby. She is a very attractive woman in her  early 40's, about 5'7-8", slim with a gorgeous toned body and pert bottom.

Once up to the very tidy apartment, I had a quick shower and then the  action started. I began on my front and was treated to a firm, sensual  massage including lots of touching and slides. This went on for about  half the session, then I flipped and we continued in the same way on the  front.

Ruby allows touching of her body including breasts and bottom, and some  gentle pussy touching. After a while of this she got me over the line  with her hands with a nice finish.

Overall I would rate this one of the better massage sessions I've had. I  would certainly see her again but at $250 it's a bit pricy for massage  only.

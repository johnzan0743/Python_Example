Gave Milli a call a few days ago but could get an appointment. Some light SMS banter which included her sending an SMS of herself. 

Made time today to attend and got to a place on Northbourne Ave. Milli is tall by my standards (I'm a short arse). Financials dealt with she leads me to the place of business.

Stripped down and then I took in the view. She's definitely thin with a tight body with a cute set of A's/B's (can't tell but it was enough for me) with puffy nipples.

Gives me a nice BBBJ whilst i'm standing up (and she reminds me that I can't CIM). Jokingly replied that I don't cum that quickly and let her continue for the next 5 or so mins. 

Before long she motions me to the bed where I lay on my back and she proceeds with a bit of cowgirl, which also some nice grinding action.

Didn't even try for doggy as I probably needed to stand up whilst she was on all fours so I decided on the mish. Pounded happily away until I felt the urge - whipped off the 'dom and blew on her smooth tanned stomach.

Wasn't the best effort on my behalf but it did the trick.

$150 for 30 mins is a bit steep by my cheap standards, but it's rare for Caucasians in the ACT to charge less than $120 for FS 30 mins.

I have had my eye on Milli's ad in the CT for some time. I was wondering if any of the good punters here could provide any more info on this WL? I would be happy to take a hit and report back, but hoping the community here could provide me with some info before investing myself. 

Sorry if this is against the posting rules. I'm generally a casual punter but have been a bit more in the game as of late.

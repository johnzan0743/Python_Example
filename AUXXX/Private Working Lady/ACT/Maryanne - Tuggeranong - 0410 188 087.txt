 Maryanne - Tuggeranong - 0410 188 087
				
Post Content: 
I've seen this ad from time to time in the Canberra Times -

MARYANNE. 0410 188 087. Tuggeranong. Size 8, petite. Girlfriend exp. 9 - 3pm only.

As she works mornings it was not ideal for me to see her, until last week!

She sounded very keen and genuine over the phone and was very forthcoming with information about herself and her service. She charges $150 for half an hour and $250 for an hour and the GFE is included. I booked for half an hour and was immediately given the address.

The address is in Kambah and when I arrived she welcomed me in a see through outfit over some sexy lingerie. She is as described in the ad and has medium sized breasts and a reasonably tight body for someone in her late 30s?? After much cuddling and fondling through the dress it was time for it to come off and there was a lot of light kissing and simulated sex. Then she brought out a dildo that I used on her for a bit while she got the dom on and gave me a decent CBJ. She then did the CG which didn't do much for me so we went missionary where I banged her hard, which she acknowledged  with appropriate moaning. I finally gave it up and she got the dom off and we cuddled some more before I showered and left.

The experience was good and she managed to keep me on the brink most of the time and she is into what she does and is very responsive and is not a clock watcher. But that being said I didn't feel it was value for money as at that price you can see most of the younger WLs of Canberra.

Body - 7
Face - 7
GFE - 8
CBJ - 7
Overall - 7

Mate, I am impressed, you got a tight bodied 30 year old woman, who is not a clock watcher, to provide a CBJ, two postion sex, was into what she does, for $150 for 30 minutes and you consider her not good value for money as there are many other better younger WL's in Canberra. 

Canberra must be awash with great talent.

Here in Sydney we would be stoked for a lady such as her.

Seriously, is there something else to add to the review that may explain why you were so unhappy?

Thanks for the review.

Hi mate, I'm definitely not unhappy with the experience! A few minuses for me would be that since Canberra is a small place and discretion is important and it can be a bit unnerving visiting a WL on a residential street in broad daylight And the first impression of the house from the outside was that it was pretty unkempt although it is well maintained and tidy on the inside. And after walking through the house to the 'room' I couldn't quite shake off the feeling that I was shagging a mum while the kids were at school....which made it all a bit sad really. And the clothes she had on didn't smell good and it felt like I had caught her in the middle of housework! I can understand that these might not be a big deal to someone else but they influenced my experience. 

I was only pointing out that at $150 for half an hour you can have a great experience with someone like Laura (who visits from Melbourne) or the Eurasian chick Tamia which will leave you with a high!  And the same experience with a comparable caucasian WL in Canberra called Samara (0409 074 721) will cost less and is a more professional operation. And a lot of young asian girls like Nicole (0411 792 253) will deliver the same service for $100. But then again YMMV

I visited Maryanne today for a 30 minute session at 150 at a last minute notice as I've not been able to get a hold of her as she only works 6 hours a day, she's 45 and definately signs of having kids which is ok fo  the amount of money you pay, not bad IMO, she definately luvs getting off with you and she says that she luvs sex and it was obvious to me, you can have a great time with her

'fraid I'm going to have to disagree a little strongly here. This lady is quite special and any regular ought to consider themselves quite fortunate. Note that this may have quite a bit less to do with what the client thinks of her and quite a lot to do with what she thinks of that client. I would speculate that anyone who thinks they received a hum-drum experience either did something which caused her to switch off, or needs to go back to Foreplay 101 and reabsorb those lessons about receiving and giving and all that. 

OK, she's not a young model type, but doesn't pretend to be either, but is still in bloody good shape for her age and has a libido which could give most 18 yo guys a run for their money. She's possibly a tad dear for a one-off visit, but don't go there with that mentality and you might very well be surprised about how things could eventually pan out...

Different strokes I guess. This would be more of a turn on for me, better to bang some random housewife than a pro who already banged 20 other blokes that week

An afterthought (God, I'm starting to sound like a feminist here - what's the world coming to?) :-S :

If someone goes around there acting like a boy instead of a man (no matter what his age), he will most likely be treated as (surprise, surprise) a boy. OTOH, that's all some guys know anyway and they would probably be uncomfortable with anything else.

I believe I just did provide a few review-type remarks about some aspects which happen to interest me, like M.'s attitude and client-WL dynamics.

But if you want me to do the template thing, I basically can't be arsed. I think a reasonable picture of M. is now there for someone to decide (a) whether they fancy investigating further, or (b) whether they would prefer to go for a $100 Asian quickie. Tip: I personally wouldn't mention having ever pursued the #b option to M., in the interests of a more satisfying session.

It would probably be more accurate to say that I endure many reviews,  mainly on account of them being obsessed with tits/weight/age/services provided, and unimaginatively written in the way they go on about "first she sucked me off, then we tried this position and that position and... then I left". Oh, and another aspect I can do without is what the punter's orgasm felt like - I'm much more interested in knowing what *she* is like when you she gets her rocks off (assuming that occurs). 

I'm in fact interested in age myself, but mainly in the reverse sense of locating mature women in decent shape. Some basic biographical details that I regard as absolutely essential but many others disregard include hair colour, eye colour, skin tone, and bi-ness or otherwise. 

Of course I'm interested in price, like we all are, but possibly from a slightly different angle than usual. To put it bluntly,  I usually have no trouble whatsoever in getting any extras short of CIM and anal thrown into the package without even asking, and I assume this is because I turn up clean and make a bit of an effort to get to know the lady before getting down to business. So when someone says "she won't do X, Y or Z without more cash", and this particular "she" isn't performing cheap, impersonal quickies, I wonder whether such remarks possibly say more about the punter himself. I do, however, appreciate warnings that hardly nobody ever provides about those warm, friendly women who think their conversation is so fascinating that it *substitutes* for sex and then try and shame clients into offering more when time runs out (Elena or Samara - are you reading this?) :-P 

I'd ideally like to know whether the lady is seeing 10 clients a day or is more selective, and how many are regulars versus anonymous. I realise punters may very well take a few visits to establish these things , but many don't even seem to consider these important. A shag is a shag and all that,  but it's not so great if the lady seems permanently shagged out! On a related note,  I always appreciate warnings about obtaining bookings becoming an endurance test, whether this is because the lady is in high demand, doesn't work a lot,  doesn't return calls, is generally disorganised, or (worst of all) likes to turn the tables and play elusive games so that punters are chasing her business rather than vice-versa.

So yeah, I do read selected reviews, but often skip big chunks of them.I maintain that I've supplied quite a bit of information about Maryanne, whether you want to call it a review or not. And another aspect is that I wasn't originally writing from scratch, but instead trying to counterbalance what I thought was a pretty unfair review from someone else. That act was presumably to the gain of the Forum,  and possibly to the gain of Maryanne herself. ;-)

OK, may we agree that I have provided considerably more than the minimum 25 words of comment required,  whether it conforms to the "shower-suck-bonk" format or not?  That just leaves all the basic details that occur up front,  and most of them have already been provided in other posts. I will fill in the gaps. 

Date of Visit: Apr 2014

Age: Prior indications ranged from 30-45. She looks around 35 to me. She did in fact tell me her age, but I don't have consent to distribute that.

Size/Shape: Pint-sized in height, with an hourglass figure. I'm no lingerie salesman, so my estimates of cup size would be no better than most others. Suffice it to say that she is not at all small, and no droop. No marked cellulite.

Nationality: Caucasian with Oz accent. 

Services: didn't ask, like I indicated previously, but received most short of porn-star stuff. I stress that YMMV.

Value: This was what triggered the original debate. Based purely on physical features, $200-250 seems to be the average range for middle-aged, local, privateers in Canberra. Which in practice probably means anyone advertising as 30+. Tourists can have different pricing
structures. I don't insult anyone interesting with half-hour gigs. It is possible to find cheaper than 200, but the question has to be asked whether that is necessarily a good thing.  Above 250, the touring hotties start to compete, if you like that sort of thing (I don't). It would be fantastic if Maryanne was closer to 200, but I suspect you would never get a booking. I'm more than willing to pay 50 for the intangibles like the playful personality and the abundant enthusiasm.

The bulk of the local or frequent-visitor, more mature, privateers are absolutely horrified by the concept of review sites such as this, and have no interest in maintaining a service-provider presence. I in turn have an interest in getting along with them, because I'm one of those types who likes to build up a relationship and go back for more if the lady is right for me.

However, if guys (or girls, for that matter) have specific questions about someone in particular,  I could possibly help out by filling in a few gaps or by correcting misperceptions. But note that I don't think too much of the "does she do X, Y and Z?" question for reasons that I have already explained.

Some of them with good reason.  This service sector would have to have one of the highest levels of misleading and deceptive advertising (e.g. a self-described early 40s cougar turns out to resemble a 50-something granny), probably even making used car salesmen and real estate agents blush (apologies to any punters in these professions).

A review site such as this means the sub-par or downright shonky operators are exposed, saving the rest of us some scarce $$$.  Conversely, the good ones become sought after and, hopefully, prosper.  It's not perfect, and I can understand the standard review template may not be for everyone, but it's infinitely better than trying to pick your next punt totally blind.  That doesn't stop some of us from TOFTT every now and then, of course -- but by reviewing these previously 'unknown' ladies, it helps the next punter make a more informed decision whether or not she's one for him.

I would have thought that a much more plausible explanation is that I'm simply a satisfied client who, incidentally, hasn't exactly gushed as if she is flawless and the last word. There is quite possibly better value around, but it all depends what floats your boat, which may be completely different to what floats my boat. For example, I'm 40-something and am on a bit of a mission to see how much I can turn on WLs as much as vice-versa, which I suspect is a bit of an ego-stroking thing bound up with my current mid-life crisis.  On the other hand, I assume a number of patrons here are young guys on a different mission to sample the greatest variety of hot young women at the cheapest possible price, and to hell with any GFE. In that case, I suggest an obvious approach is to wait for the latest Asian hottie to turn up at Argyle or Monterey or wherever, and to follow the conga line going round to give her a half hour workout where she bends over backwards (!) to please this dude clutching the money and calling all the shots.

Every so often I assume these same punters get the idea that they might try a MILF-type for the variety and maybe also because they have some sort of unresolved mother complex (or should that be Mrs Robinson)? Now, this is where I have attempted to provide some hopefully useful information about dealing with such situations. First of all,  your skills and attitude will be evaluated as much as theirs, and if you're not comfortable with that, then I would suggest trying something different. Secondly, this particular lady regards her work as a play opportunity and isn't nearly as driven by money as some might like to think. If she gets the idea that some guy is simply looking for a starfish, then that's likely a recipe for instant freezer treatment and unreturned enquiries next time round. Pretty simple really when you think about it, but only if you're capable of getting your head around the idea that all WLs aren't in the business for the one, single reason.

I suppose I also have an ulterior motive for making some of these remarks, which is that the more dickheads who manage to slip through M.'s filter, the more likely she is to decide she's over it and to either retire or go underground, thus spoiling things for those of us who appreciate her. Part of the reason for her and other privateers working school hours or 9-5 is to avoid the dipstick set, and I for one don't blame her whatsoever for taking control for the sake of remaining in the industry. BTW, don't get the idea that I'm some sort of uncritical MILF chaser. I notice that Samantha is copping some flack in another thread at the moment,  and I'm not exactly inclined to leap into her defence in the same way that I did here.

If you want to dream up conspiracy theories about who I may be in disguise, then please be my guest and go right ahead. I'm not bothered in the slightest because I'm much more interested in impressing these ladies that I actually know than in anonymous Internet chin waggers. Sorry to be so brutally frank, but that's just how it is. So let's cut the sniping and get back to swapping useful information, eh?

I think I've contributed more than my fair share to this thread, unless someone else wants to step up to the plate

Maryanne, sorry, carpet crawler- you have a lot to say for one not bothered. By the way I don't see many other reviews you have posted!!

Mods, I think this thread has reached its logical conclusion.  Nothing new seems to be added and the review of Maryanne seems to have sunk right to the bottom.

Noted.. 

All that needs to happen is for CC to come clean and say who they are.. The reason being we can offer alternative arrangements and status of the forum rather than use of deception.. To promote and advertise for free.. 

An amnesty of 24hrs will be given to you to contact the admin or moderation team.. If not the thread will be closed and deleted..

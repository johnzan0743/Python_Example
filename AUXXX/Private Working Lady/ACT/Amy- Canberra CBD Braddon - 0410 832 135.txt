My experience/comments:

Amy is Natalie's friend, she messaged me to go and see her. She seemed quite cheeky and sweet via text, and she is the same in person.

Appointment was easily made, she stays at the same apartment Natalie used to stay, share with Polly.

Amy's face is not as pretty as Natalie, but decent enough. Started with shower then massage, her massage is really good, would have enjoyed a bit longer if time allows. Covered FS was good, she was quite tight and made all the right noise. She was quite into it and genuine in the process.

WIR? Maybe, she is decent and sweet, though like most Thai girls, not interested in kissing which is a let down for me.

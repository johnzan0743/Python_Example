Has anyone seen this girl, advertises on Craigslist, this one is for today but most of the other days she just mentions that she's in need of some funds, 





			
				Its slow day sunday - I normally host  - if you have a particular idea in mind and wanna meet up for some rewardable fun or some stress relief, I.d like to hear from you! 
 Looking forward to hearing from you!

Um, Legs, did you miss a four-letter word beginning with 'F' from the title of the thread?  Cos if she's advertising D&D (as opposed to D&D FREE), I'd skip it.

 Money to spend
				
Post Content: 
I have a spare grand to spend on a girl in Canberra.  I don't wanna be ripped of,  so who shall I choose?

Don't know if I can help you as it's pretty variable.  Best bet is to check if they have a website.  the dodgy ones usually don't.

With that much to spend, perhaps a PSE from Roxxie, who has given pretty uniform satisfaction to her reviewers over the years.

I have no personal experience but she is very well reviewed and looks sweet (yes, she has a website).

Might pick someone up at the casino bar or blackjack table!

Now son, dont spend it all at once!   Up in Sydney you could get as least a dozen reasonable roots for that kind of money.  As it's called punting, for sure you would get at least half of them as great sex.  Far better odds than blowing all on one lady.  However, Roxie does sound interesting!

That's a very easy question to answer, which is Ambrosia Rose. Check her website at Canberra Escort | private escort canberra | independent Canberra escort | Ambrosia Rose.

Perhaps negotiate a double with Roxy and Ambrosia?

As usual everything depends on your personal tastes.
But I have seen Roxy and she is easily (in my personal opinion) the best woman in Canberra.

Never met Roxy, but reading her blogs, she strikes me as being intelligent and assertive, full of character and a communicator, the kind of girl some might want for a GF.  However, if said punter is wanting a subservient blank body to satisfy his needs, Roxy might not suit.

Roxy is a strong, assertive personality and one of my all time favourite ladies. The lady is very agreeable to  a lot of extras that guys want. I recommend her to anyone who wants a good sensual session.

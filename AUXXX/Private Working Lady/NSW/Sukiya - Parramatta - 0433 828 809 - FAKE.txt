My experience/comments :

I was short a review this half year (?) so I thought I'll just TOFTT with a private.

She lives in a modern and clean apartment in Parra CBD. She was alone when I rocked up but there were a few extra beds so maybe she has flatmates.

Pretty cute but either her photos have been heavily touched up or the mask hides a lot of her features cause she didn't really look like her photos. Average shaped with good curves, not chubby though. Real perky B's.

I jumped in the shower to freshen up then laid down on her really soft bed. No catbath given and I didn't ask for one. She cleaned me up really meticulously and straight into a BBBJ (+$50, I asked if $50 extra would cover CIM but she wanted another $50 but dropped it to $30 when I said nah). Her BBBJ was real good and she got me over the line quickly. CIM wasn't something to write home about; she didn't even try to hide the fact that she did not enjoy it and was coughing up loogeys for the rest of the session.

Her massage though was great. Plenty of pressure and with pretty good technique.

Now what got some good marks from me was her tenacity in getting me over the line twice (ormally I'm a once per session). A little tickle tackle here and there, a flip and she's got a dom on me and started a CBJ that got me going real quick. At this point I was a little turned off from the loogy'ing and just pumped away in missionary til I finished. Nothing noteworthy about the CFS: a little bit of starfishing and a little FOAM'ing.

After another shower, I was out in about 40 mins but that was fine with me. I don't think I'll see her again or at least I doubt I'll pay for CIM again.

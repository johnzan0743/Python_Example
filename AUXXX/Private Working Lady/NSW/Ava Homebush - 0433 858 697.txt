My experience/comments :

The night before my final exam, I thought I'd get a good release before heading to bed. My usual wasn't available and I was impatient so didn't want to want. Looked around on Loncato, for which I can no longer find the exact ad. Photos were of a mid 20s girl, slender looking with a cute face. Hit her up and she replied immediately confirming that she'd be available now. I got baited........got there and the girl was like size 12 or 14. Now I do like my women curvy, but her ad said otherwise. I'd fallen to fake pics, but I was still keen for a release and went ahead anyway. One of my few punts that I regret, where I should have just waited for my regular.

At the time , I thought to my self FUCK IT just do this. So paid 230 for the hour and headed to the shower which was decently clean, she however didn't seem as so. What gave that away? She smelt like she hadn't showered, not exactly sour, but coarse smell. Not sure exactly how to describe it, but not pleasant. No way I was going to perform DATY, even her breasts smelled funny. Gave me a CBJ instead when the ad stated BBBJ. When I finally realized this was a terrible mistake, I just wanted to get out. Finished in less than 15 minutes or arrive in doggy and just made a fake excuse that my manager was calling me in to work even though I had taken the next day off for my exam. This was at 10PM.

Headed off into the night and by then my regular said she had just gotten home and was free. However this punt had already ruined me for the night. Went home and slept it off.

Sometimes you gotta TOFTT and be the unlucky guy, but I just look at this as experience growing older.

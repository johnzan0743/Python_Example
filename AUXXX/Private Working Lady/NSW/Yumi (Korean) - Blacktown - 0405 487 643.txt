My experience/comments:

Hi all,

I'm new to this..

I tried and visited Yumi one Sunday afternoon. I got her details through cracker.com website. She stated on the ads that she was 23. No offence, she looked a bit older than that. The Blacktown location got me interested as I live nearby. Yumi operates from a private house and I believe she is not the only one working in the premises, although she was the only one there at the time.

I opted for the 30 minute full service. As soon as I got there, she was warm enough with the usual exchange of pleasantries.

We got undressed and she took me for a shower. Accomodating me first, then she had her own shower for a couple of minutes, then we met back in the bedroom.

She was light and smooth skinned, D cup sized tits and fully shaved. She performed a quick covered BJ and then she hopped on top. Did her in about 2 other positions but I just could not reach that climax point. Again, maybe 1 hour services may be more suitable for me because I just take too long. She ended up giving me a handjob to finish things off.

Had another shower to clean off and said our goodbyes.

I would rate the whole experience and personal satisfaction at 60%.

Hopefully there are enough details here for the review to go through. If you have any questions, feel free to ask away.

Cheers.

Gday lads,

That is a very good question. Unfortunately, I've come to the conclusion, most Asian ads does not feature their real fotos. If it was their foto, they were so dolled up that it does not look like them in person. I'm sure you've seen those make up videos floating around in Facebooke etc.

Sanjay, try her for your own experience mate. It might be turn out to be different than mine. She wasn't bad but I've had better experience sadly in a parlour than this one.

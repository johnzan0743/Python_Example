My experience/comments :
Okay so I was super toey today. And I live blacktown and was heading towards Parra for dinner with friends, so thought to myself why not have some sexual healing before!
In a super good mood, looked locanto. I thought I had found GOLD! $80 for 20 mins for a bombshell French Blonde with a stunning figure!
Well I have had some bag packer girls I paid and some I did not...  who I picked from hostels... so I thought to myself probably 1-week layover french bag packer tryinna extract some money and does not know the market rates in Aussie so probably did not put up a big price!! 
WRONG!! Dead wrong!!!
Now she did not pick up my calls. Further she sms ed me the exact same pics on locanto. Exact same description. I was like this is cool. She provided very clear instructions to get to her apartment in Parramatta with lift codes, buzzers, reception directions etc.
Once she opened the door, there were 2 rooms with curtains. The lady greeted me in black lingerie and was full blown asian with thick chinese english accent.
I asked here I am here to see Emily. She was like "That is me.". I was like mind fucked. I took my phone out, showed her the ad and told her, this was the deal where is her. She nervously smiled and said it was fake, but she can do a discount for 60 for a blow and go.
Honestly, if I was super horny, I would have. Because regardless, a blow and go for 60 is always a good deal when you need to stick your dick in something.
But I was just literally mind fucked and the fact that she scammed her way into the booking and potentially lot of other punters just really made me feel that this is not the kind of human being I wanna give my money too.
We all have punts with the love and goodness at heart. All we want is a bit of fun. We don't scam escorts and scam their money. Right? Plus I have always seen PWL and Private massage ladies, where chemistry built up, and we both received and gave. This is just bad!!!
SO YOU HAVE BEEN OFFICIALLY WARNED!!!!
If you are loooking for a 80-60 dollar blow and go with a Chinese escort, to be honest it is not a bad deal. Infact it is quite cheap.
BUT the scamming is what absolutely put me off.
I walked off with no money exchange or service exchange.

A simple GRIS would have saved a lot of time.

I think I saw that ad and got super superstitious. Price was too low. But it does seem culturally something has changed in the world of punting. Young white girls aren't easy to come by these days. The good looking ones are choosing Sugar Daddy websites because there will be some old horny bastard that will pay high prices for a pretty white girl in her 20s. Having said that I did strike gold at Gateway Club last year I think with an Eastern European lass but they charge at least $220 for 30mins.

There use to be nice young ladies at Croydon Palace but I find the young ones ladies are heavily tattooed which I find a bit of a turn off or are a bit older.

Yeah Soo many fakes, it's making it super hard to find anyone new on Locanto or any of those sites.

If the price is too good to be true it 100% is fake. 
I always do a reverse image search and if they tell me they're from some overseas country say France or Ukraine or something then all I do is use Google translate to send them a message in their language and they always reply with ?? having no idea

Good that you walked, they rely on people not walking. For every person that walks there must be 1-2 that stay and they are ones that encourage the use of fake pics

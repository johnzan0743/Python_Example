My experience/comments:
Called Sofia after finding her ad in the Torch, and spoke to european souding lady on the phone. Got the address and headed over. It's in a pretty shitty area of Riverwood, and she works out of a housing commission apartment.
Anyway, I was convinced she was going to be a shocker, but sure enough I was pleasantly surprised when she opened the door. Blonde hair, nice eyes, nice C cups, nice tanned skin and a huge round arse but not fat at all. Fucking sold.
Was also surprised by her accent which was decidedly australian; apparently another lady takes the calls. Had a shower and got down to business. Straight into CBJ, and after a few minutes she hopped on. Changed a few positions and then got her to jerk me off. To be honest it was a little mechanical, but her arse more than makes up for it. for the money she is fucking gorgeous, a true blonde italian milf.

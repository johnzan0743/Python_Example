My experience/comments : 

Found this lady from an ad in the local paper. Advertised as 40yo sex goddess, fit body, nice smile. I spoke to her a few times and never seemed to be able to organise a meet. She was working out of a motel room in Blakehurst on limited day and limited times. She has a nice voice and I was keen to spend an hour with her. When I finally got to make an appointment she had moved and was operating from a private address in Mascot. COnsidering it was a distance from where I was at I wanted to do an hour. Unfortunately when I arrived she had to pick up a friend in 30 mins, so from the start it all felt a bit rushed. She is very pleasant and the body was pretty good, but she is in that 40 something bracket. $100 for the 30 mins and we were into it. The place is very private. Her oral technique was good as was her cowgirl, like I say my main complaint was I felt the clock was ticking. I suppose I walked away feeling a bit disappointed it was supposed to be a GFE. Don't think I'd go back.

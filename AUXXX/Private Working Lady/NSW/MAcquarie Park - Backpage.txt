HI fellow punters

I just wanted to let everyone know that a week or so ago I tried all the backpage ads for privates in MAcq Park cause I was in the area

They had suspiciously good looking photos for 120 or 150 for 1/2 hr so the rates are cheap so i thought i would give it a go

in the end they all lead to a private unit in waterloo rd.....

when i turned up (around 12 noon).... there was only one girl available and she was nothing like the photos not even close...really disappointing .. so i walked

then i tried the other numbres and was directed back to the same address..which was funny....

so just a word of warning




eg:

??? 100% GFE I??U ??? - Sydney escorts - backpage.com.au

New New ???Real Photo ???YOUNG - - Sydney escorts - backpage.com.au

We should start reporting the addresses to the strata or hotel management. I have spoken to western women on the phone and they have guaranteed me that they are Asian, driven for an hour to the city and been shown an Asian. For $250 half hour, I am not going ahead with that. 
Once they dropped the price to $100 for half and I agreed but I am seriously going to start reporting them to hotel management for this crap.

Indian punter, don't even think about that. That is so wrong, I understand your unhappy but that's what the forums for to express yourself.

Why would you do that for? Just because the quality isn't what you wanted it to be? Can't have been that bad if you agreed to pay for half an hour. Pretty selfish and mean of you to take the service and then want to punish them.

I agree with you indian_punter

It's a much more effective way at weeding out the bad apples. The example you described is deceitful and wouldn't be tolerated by another business so it's only fair to call out bad, unethical business.

You take the good with the bad.
You can stay or you can walk.
Grafting on someone is poor form.
It is called punting for a reason.
If not. It would be called "a sure thing"

You lose the 'moral right', (if it can be called that) once you paid and availed of the services. Also the poor girls are there to make a living. So chill out. If EVERYONE walked if they found the pics and WL was different. It would be the best way to discourage false advertising. In my opinion.

Yes l agree with you also Acharya, best bet is to walk if the advertising is false. I never hesistate to turn down services if l think l won't get value for money.

Though they aren't 'poor girls'. I know a few escorts and they are independent and self sufficient, and make more than many professionals who spend years studying. 

They are simply trying to capitalise on genetic privilege - as in being born female, there is such strong demand for your body sexually that people are willing to pay!

I have on occasion called them on the phone and ask them specifically if they are Caucasian. They have confirmed that they are indeed Caucasian and the photos that they're sending me an SMS are real.

I have been traveled over half an hour from Western Sydney to see them in the city. Only to find that they are Asians and have completely lied to me.

If there are entitled to to bluntly lie and deceive me like this then I am entitled in return to report them for illegally using a premises as a brothel.

The "punt" in my opinion refers to whether the sex is good or not not whether the advertising is true or false.

Indian Punter this is the 2nd time you have threatened to report someone for using premises.
I can tell you that people will be warned and you will find yourself without anyone to see.
I'm sure some of the girls if you approached them in here would refuse to see you for fear of being reported.
What they did was wrong but two wrongs don't make a right.

I agree with indian punter too about fake photos.it all takes time to search and organise a punt,travel usually more than half hour each way then find someone completely different than what you were willing to pay for. Sometimes I will only have a 2 hour window to see a WL.if its not the person described,there goes my punt which pisses me off for the rest of the day..Punting should be about taking a chance on the quality of service not about having to guess weather the woman (or man)is the person described in the advertisement.

Well I don't approach anyone in here. And anyone who is honest or real doesn't have to worry about being reported.

But are you suggesting that my time is worth nothing ?

If they are going to deliberately lie and deceive, they deserve to simply be allowed to keep doing it without any repercussions whatsoever?

That doesn't seem fair at all.
What if I constantly call and make appointments with all these ladies and just don't turn up ? Will that be ok ? Surely not.

It would be more okay than destroying their livelihoods, in my opinion. But it would also be petty and cruel and achieve nothing for you. 

What they are doing is absolutely not okay. It affects those of us who are honest and upfront with our advertising as much as it affects you guys, and it affects the perception of the industry as a whole. No, it isn't fair and that is the number 1 reason why I am such a big supporter of review sites, which the majority of workers aren't. But I don't think the answer is resorting to legal action. In my opinion that is going a step too far.

I would be more than happy to see them at the $100 per half rate that they are worth.
But to put a tall blonde caucasian lady on cracker and expect $300 per half hour ?

It will not destroy their livelihood. They will be kicked out and they will find another location.
They will be inconvenienced at most. Exactly what they do to us.

I am a very respectful punter and I treat my ladies with upmost respect and kindness. I find it impossible to say no but I hate being decieved so bluntly. And so often ! 
I'm glad cracker is gone.

Some perspective on privates..

Most of my run in with fake pictures+privates are "agencies". Groups running shops in apartments/houses. The girls often can hardly speak English* and often use their phones to translate. You would be destroying the agencies livelihoods, and the girls they have bought into the country who are currently working for them along with it. Would you be onboard naming and shaming shops that consistently used fake girl pictures, because that is essentially what you would be doing.

In short they are not privates, they are not working for themselves and the girls themselves possibly have no idea where they are being advertised with incorrect photos. For example look at the ads in rosehill, Sydney. Every one is fake. Their "livelyhood" is dependent upon getting people in the door who are either too afraid to leave when they see what is on offer or hoping that when the clothes come off the girl in the ad will be underneath.

I have little sympathy for these guys who stay. The "waste of time" factor is a minimal aspect for me because I am sensible enough to visit "privates" who are near my location when I feel like punting. Driving across sydney for a private with no intel is folly. However this is what those groups are dependent on to make bank. I don't know if they should be doxxed or not, however please don't take the angle that you are depriving single owner operators of their livelyhood because this is not what the majority of them are.

*I say this to highlight that they require someone to help them do this, not because I have a problem with non-English speaking people.

imo It affects other privates/providers much more than punters. You work with this every day - deal with clients faffing around because of fake pictures every day. I only deal with it when I punt. Granted other people might do it more often and it would have a larger impact on them. The privates I am friendly with who are asian have a nightmare of a time because everything is assumed to be fake.

The legit privates are impacted more by the dodgy operators and there are more dodgy operators than there are legit ones.

honestly you should be able to tell if an ad is fake in 2018, if it sounds too good to be true it probably is and you can use reverse image search. Snitching on these places is a bit weak and I'm sure at least 50% of the time the hotel management and/or landlord know full well what their tenants are up to. You may also find that a lot of these women are working for, or paying off, heavy dudes...

 Just should just go to one of the many $150-160hr places that are tried and tested if you want cheap fun with a decent looking Asian lady IMHO.

I can't believe some of the nonsense being posted here.

FFS, do your research. Have some brains about sifting through ads and it becomes pretty clear which are fakes and which are not.

The idea of reporting to landlords or strata managers is so stupid it beggars belief. That is the very thing that councils and state governments use to change the rules for the whole industry and if that is the sort of "holier-than-thou" attitude you possess, then you have no place on this forum. Just go to the brothels and take your pick.

The online ads for privates, shops and parlours are all part of the industry and part of PUNTING.

Get over yourselves about finding an ad is fake. Use your brains to make your decisions. This is the real world.

If all else fails, walk. It's not rocket science.

Finally, now that BP etc is gone, WTF are you going to whinge about now?

 Asian in a stocking - anyone come across her?
				
Post Content: 
I was in Sydney - Darling Harbour in 2007 for a conference  and saw her ad in the Daily Telegraph.  The title was "Asian in a stocking....." and worked in an apartment around the Darling Harbour area.

She was beautiful, tanned and spoke as if she has lived in Australia for a long time.  About 25yo.  Did an incredible bodyslide with HJ happy ending.  FS was available as well as CBJ as extras but I was addicted to her bodyslides and went back. Once whilst I was there during the lunch break, she asked if I had my lunch and even offered me lunch.  A nice touch I though. 

She said she was only working for a few monnths to pay off debts and then she was going to quit.  I was infatuated with her and wanted to visit her again (from Canberra) but never made it back.  

When I called her number a few months later, another person answered and said that she no longer lived there.

Has anyone seen her of late?

If you still have her number or a mobile or even a name we could track her down but an Asian body slide doesn't exactly.... Narrow it down in Sydney 2011.

LOL - true.  Unfortunately have tried the mobile and was advised it had been disconnected. As mentioned above, when trying the landline was advised she had moved on.  I subsequently deleted the numbers but unfortunately can't get her out of my mind :P

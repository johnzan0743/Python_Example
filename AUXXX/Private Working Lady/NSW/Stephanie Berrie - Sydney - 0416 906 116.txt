My experience/comments:

It's ironic that the best encounter of my life came across in a boring Tuesday night. What made the encounter so memorable was a simple orgasm, and then another, and then another. I came 4 times over the course of 1 glorious hour. The way I felt inside was much more satisfying. The true pleasure of sex is more than a momentary sensation of release. 

Pleasure is defined as never being able to get enough of each other. I never had enough and I want Stephanie booked by me next week!

It's my second time with Stephanie and it seems that there's still excitement keeping between us. Her outfit invited me to slide up my hand up her skimpy skirt.She went to the shower directly. Seeing her emerge from a steamy bathroom with droplets of water makes me want to dry her off with my tongue.She giggled and squirmed around the tub. Her stare melted me down telling me to ambush her in the shower. It's way sexier and a hundred times more fun. Make yourself up with Stephanie anytime this week and enjoy!

Hello Waverton. Thank you for your comment. I don't have any intention of advertising Stephie. I booked her twice and I simply want to share my experience for the benefit of others. I have clearly read and understood the rules of this forum and no other agenda at all.

Cheers!

Very obviously not a genuine review mate, the guys on here aren't stupid.

Try using the review template for starters, and giving us some useful info about the girl and her service.

Gents not to down play anyone's review but I have seen another woman from the same agency and in my opinion not worth it and fake pics! I will post a review in the coming days

Except the OP, who has 2 ads - sorry posts - for this agency, I agree with all the above. If it looks like chocolate, smells like chocolate, tastes like chocolate... odds are, it's chocolate. The OP looks, smells, tastes, like an ad...

A full view of the APE site guarantees it...

Gee I can have 5 one hour punts and some change for that price she would want to be good! Is any woman that good or worth that sort of money?

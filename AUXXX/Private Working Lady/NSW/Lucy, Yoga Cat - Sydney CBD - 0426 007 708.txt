Has anyone tried her yet??

Her ad is posted here: YogaCat.... - Sydney escorts - backpage.com

She claims to have really strong pelvic muscles, and magic pussy which got me curious.
Looks fun. Am Never the type to go for escorts at +$400 price range. Would love to get some intel before plunging into it myself.

Wow,  looks awesome.  BUT,  $400 an hour, and then wanting another $150 for BBBJ,  no way.  Occasionally, for a hot private I'd pay the 400, if it included the bbbj, not as an extra though.

She does look very flexible. I don't know if I could keep up.

Talking about rates against CBJ or BBBJ. I am happy with either.

The only thing, with a blue vein, that my wife will now put in her mouth is f'n cheese.

Therefore, either would be fine.

Hey bluey you could always miss out on showers for the next month and culture some knob cheese of your own.  Then the missus couldn't refuse .

She looks kind of OK but if I had to guess she is early to mid 30's not even close to 24 so for those wanting a younger lady there's a fair chance of disappointment if they are good at picking the real age of women.  Better options elsewhere for similar money.

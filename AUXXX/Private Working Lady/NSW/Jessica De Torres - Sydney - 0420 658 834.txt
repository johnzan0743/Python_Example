Contact Details/Address:  sexy-jessica@live.com.au

Prices: $300 per hour

Age: 21 ( i think she might be a little older)

Size/shape: curvy but not fat

Nationality or Ethnicity: spanish background

Services: does most things with GFE....FK, CBJ, MO

Value for money/recommend ? if i had to rate, i would say 7/10.....not bad but needs to work on openess and value to be a high class gfe.

My experience: Booked for 2 hours.....was pleased with prettiness. Definately had fun but as an after thought, I think I got caught up in her beauty and did not get to really take advantage of my booking.

Thanks for sharing kizzbut. Other reviews of Jessica suggest, as you say, that maybe she needs to work on some aspects of her service. She is certainly a good looking young woman and all the pointers suggest that with a bit more experience, she will become an excellent service provider.

Fantastic time had

    I have had the pleasure of seeing Jessica De Torres a few times recently in Sydney

    I have found her easy to contact as she always seems to answer my sms very promptly contact 0420658834

    Her prices are reasonable from $300 per hour

    Our sessions have always been great, her body is in my opinion perfect and her service is always great. It is a GFE and she is a willing to put me at ease.

    I would describe her as natural, both in beauty and personality, she just seems natural and at ease in my company and her own skin.

    Value for money/recommend?: Highly recommend for a great time with a lovely lady

    My experience/comments: I now want to make Jessica a regular indulgence

If you read the reviews of this lady around the various sites, they are mostly negative by those with a track record of reviews with the occasional positive one being by those with no track record and by those who never review again. Now this is just an observation. I hope this observation is acceptable to the powers that be. If not, I am bracing myself for a rebuke!

I tried booking with her a while back, exchanged some pleasant e-mails with her but after I told her I had a foot fetish I recieved a four word e-mail in reply "Don't contact me again".

Now I could understand if she doesn't cater for fetishes but I found her to be rude and arrogant and as it states on her website that she provides rimming and anal play on male clients I would have thought that a bit of toe sucking would be less than offensive in comparison...whatever.

I'd advise people to spend their money elsewhere.

Thanks for the information, that does seem unpleasant, I would of thought that a "Foot fetish" was not that uncommon and not that difficult to deal with.

Maybe she is insanely ticklish.

Good luck with your next punt.

Yeah, that's what I thought as well. I'm at a loss to explain the attitude I recieved from her.

I am very sorry to hear this.. Maybe she's had a bad experience with foot fetish guys? A lot of men desire this service, so much so I am devoting a special section of my website to foot pictures. In my experience I see 6 foot fetish guys to one rimmer. I know some girls hate having their feet touched or played with, so that might be an explanation.

I left a similar review of Jessica on her Cracker advert a few weeks back. At first she replied that I had never been in contact with her and I was a liar. I replied with date and time of contact as well as a short transcript of our conversation. She then said that I had been in contact with her, that I was stalking her and e-mailing her constantly...both totally untrue.

I'm not a vindictive person but when somone is arrogant and rude to me for no reason, then accuses me of harrassment and criminal behaviour simply because they don't like the truthfull review I left for them I'm going to make sure as many punters hear about it as possible.

Person's Name : Jessica De Torres

Date of Visit : 10/2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Escort Sydney Jessica De Torres â€“ Busty Blonde Escort - 0420 658 834

Hours of Business :  24hrs

Rates : $250 hour

Age : Late 20s

Size/shape : Big girl, big tits

Nationality or Ethnicity : Aus I think

Services Provided : CBJ, CoB

Value for money/recommend? : Actually yes!

Wasn't sure what to expect with all the off reviews that this girl has had but booked anyway. She called me about 15 minutes before our appointment and said she was going to be 1/2 hour late. Well, that turned into an hour which wasn't a good start to the meeting. She did say she would give me some extra time but I sot of guessed that that wouldn't happen, oh well.

Now her prices state $300 an hour but I wasn't going to pay that so $250 it was, no objections. Nice apartment in Chatswood with a view across the way to an office block. Jessica likes to strut around her apartment completely naked with the curtains wide open so how anyone gets any work done over there I will never know.

She has a body that could be described as "thick", I wouldn't say fat but she is no lightweight that's for sure. Those massive mammaries are quite nice though, although I like boobs to be a bit more floppy than hers are. 

She lay down on the bed and stretched out in all her glory, now that was a sight to behold - superb. Her pussy is shaved but still retains some shortened hairyness, shame. Some foreplay ensued including her sucking on my dick (cbj), me sucking on her puss and on those lovely puppies, then onto the main course. 

Jessica is quite a comfortable girl to fuck, plenty of ass to grab hold of and those lovely puppies that just wouldn't wobble about quite as much as I like them to. Nevertheless it was a very nice session. Doggy was especially nice as she has a nice big rear end that just begs to be pumped. I love seeing a girl's ass wobble as I thrust inside her, and her's was indeed a very nice ass. 

When the session was nearly over I tentatively asked if I could blow on her tits, fully expecting a "no", but instead received a happy "yes". So I happily wanked my load all over those big globes of hers for my finale. 

Quite a nice session, nothing special but nice for a change.

Services Provided : GFE, French (covered)

Value for money/recommend? : Slightly pricy

My experience/comments : Many people have given her a bad wrap for the services rendered. This was no exception, although it wasn't as bad as I anticipated. I originally made an appointment to see her at 3PM on that day but had to postpone it by 30 minutes. Upon arrival at her unit she greeted me and asked me to pay her and directed me to the shower. The place was a studio apartment which looked somewhat tired but was decent nonetheless. After the shower, we both lied on the bed and started talking about how our day was, plans for Christmas and more about her role and the apartment used to greet clients as she caressed me by her hand. She told me how she was doing this since the age of 18, had a couple of stints at a parlour before going independent. I find it somewhat surprising how she wanted to retire but she is definitely pondering it: confusedx: . Anyway, once we ran out of things to talk about we got started. She proceeded for French. I asked for it to be natural French but she said that it incurred an extra $50 fee which was not mentioned where I found it (Cracker). She justified her reason by using the NSW law. I decided not to argue and let her have a go. It was a bit toothy and she did not go all the way but at least she tried. and varied it with the ball sucking. Next up was vaginal penetration with her on top. Unlike other girls that I have previously seen, the great thing about Jessica was her figure which meant that holding onto her was much easier than I thought. It was great and was glad to see her facial emotions. We then swapped positions with  me on top as we went back and forth and exchanged kisses (no French or tongue kiss as she doesn't like it). It was great and as my enjoyments culminated with me cumming in her pussy (protected). After that we just lied back and continued talking, but by that time; it became evident of the lack of communication or willingness to connect with her clients. She was more interested in her 4 phones (yes 4) than talking to me. But at least when she did, I got to learn more about her past and her heritage. We also tried the sex again but as my male appendage didn't feel up to it we just continued to talk. and then as the time expired, just showered up and left. Overall, it wasn't too bad but the lack of a willingness to communicate, the extra fee for natural French and poor natural French was disappointing and for $250 per hour (discounted), you'd be better looking somewhere else.

A nice honest review. 

Frankly JDT would be better off just retiring as opposed to going the Farnham..."This is def my last tour...this yesr ...kinda sorta routine"...

Yes she is young chronologically speaking so you can expect with that age comes all the immaturity along with this vast lack of life experience...

There are numerous individuals along with the J.F's of this world that believe if they post or suggest this is the last opportunity to see them or be with them or rather pay them (what it's all about!) for an exclusive never to be repeated offer then you will by all means pay them for the last time... Amaree in Parra is one of those following in JF's path...

We all know and realise bullshit when we see it or hear it or read it...we are after all fed it everytime we punt...even if it is ourselves telling us "it's worth it!" don't worry the repairs on the "house, Car, Missus " can wait till after I have an amazing "o..oh....O"...oh dear what a waste... my little brain does all my thinking until he falls asleep then the real one goes into overdrive suggesting other things the cash shoulda been spent on... or other Wl's or Ml's at least...

This is known as buyers remorse...

The thing that gets me is Why?...Why after someone receives a bad review or a number of bad reviews do we go and see if they are correct...
Perhaps the masochistic tendancies in some of us are ever present....

Perhaps we should trust our fellow punters and put the Wl's and ml's who are not worth the petrol or phone call let alone anything else out of our business and maybe they will stop working and clogging up our limited time and resources in our efforts to TOFTT...a nobler pursuit is harder to imagine... well on this forum anyway...

So JDT tell the truth...work until it costs you more to advertise than you receive in an income and then apply for a real job and stop wasting punter cash and dreams and hopes for a decent faaaarKKKK...

OR Change your attitude try telling the truth like...I'd like to retire at the end of some year or even the beginning but really cannot afford to and BTW my attitude to toe sucking and feet peeps has just made my year and Swannies (thanks Wayne) as my tax return now has a whole new set of figures adding to my contribution to the nation....or not!!!...

Maybe some people should just realise that this is a service industry grow up do the service or get out of the way and let those who love their work get more appreciation and space....

Speaking of which I got a chiminey to descend...actually a few....HO HO HO...!!!

I was in Cairns early in the year and Jessica De Torres was on tour to regional towns and adv in the local paper.  The paper is full of WL's and most have photos of the typical 18 y/o Japanese student photos. I then saw Jessica De Torres and noticed she had her own website, so i knew what i was getting into and i decided to give her ago.

She promised, well she promised a lot. Anal play, multiply times of sex and so on.  I booked and hour.

Well, the girl didn't shut up the entire booking.  Talking about the end of the world and her and her friend were preparing to live on a farm.  The end of the world is going to happen due to the WFC and its going to happen again but this time 90% of the people without work.  blah blah blah

i tolerated this as 1/2 the time she spoke was was stroking my cock.  Eventually the fucking began after a very short BJ (maybe 15 seconds).  she rode the old fella well and finished with her onto.  She then looks at her clock as says thats time up.  1 hr booked 50 mins of talk, and her saying im her only booking for the night.  Was really looking for something more

I'm having trouble with that link working.

Is it just me?

Anyway, I don't think I ever read a nice review of here.

If I remember correctly she had an apartment in Chatswood, whether or not she lived in the area, she at lest spread her legs there.

I remember wandering through Chatswood Chase, a rather nice shopping centre in the heart of Chatswong, given there are so many Asians in the area now, and that is not being racist at all, it's plain fact.....

Anyway I saw here swanning around in a flowing summer dress, with this aura about her like she was on Xanax, slinking around glidding her fingers against the marble walls as she walked pasted them. She looked different to anyone else there shopping. She appeared alluring, might be the work to describe her. It was like she thought she was above all else there and that men should be taking notice. But no one was, except me, because I recognised her from her photos.

She was rather large, maybe a size 14 and certainly nothing like the photos she was using at the time.

Anyway, see if we can get the link working and I wonder if she still thinks she is Gods gift and all that other claptrap she used to pin on herself.

Try this link. https://myplaymate.com.au/escorts/sy...-caucasian-317                         Might be a bit more down to earth now too.Seems shes aged rather quickly, gone from being claimed 24 early last year to a more realistic 30 now. Plus her prices have dropped a bit and she's now avail 24/7.

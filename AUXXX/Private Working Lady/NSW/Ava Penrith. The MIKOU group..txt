 Ava Penrith. The MIKOU group.

Saw this ad on Locanto. Rang and booked. Looked fantastic. No one answers the phone. An Australian lady calls back. You ask for your lady and she books you in.


The girl you end up seeing is not the same as the ad. I walked because the difference was so dramatic between picture and reality. I asked the lady where Ava is. She told me she was Ava. I then said you are not the Ava I was expecting and I left. A few Chinese words as I walked. Good thing I don't understand.

Beware. There are several ads under this group. Since looking through all the ads later. I have found all to have the same phone number.

Thanks Bluey. I saw their ads on Cracker a few months ago. What scared me off was some of them offering BBFS and BB anal. I never called because of this, but I was always curious as some of the girls looked great in the ads.

Hey James, I vaguely remember a review of a dud at Emu Plains caravan park, was this your review? It was a great review, including your "walk of shame" back to the car.
I hope everyone realises the value of these reviews of absolute duds!

Hey Probe wow you have a good memory, the walk of shame at Emu Plains Caravan park was close to one of the worst experiences I have had and that was definitely a pre-cursor to the Mikou girl ( I am sure she was part of the group before they started operating out of Thurston st ) , no my last review was a girl called Chloe from this group.

https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f100/...4-277-a-45044/

Chloe was OK but not the girl in the pic and the place is a dump, when you call the number you get a bored sounding Australian girl who answers the phone and then she texts you the address. I have called a number of times and always got the same girl answering and the same address sent.

By the way the girl called Chloe wanted to give me her number so I could see her in more salubrious digs and I made the mistake of getting her to punch her number into my phone and then she called her phone, bingo she now had my number. Bugger me if only a few weeks back she started texting me saying "hey babe you come and see me" etc  I texted back and at first asked who the hell was texting me and then when the penny dropped I told her that I will never go back to Thurston st it is a dump no towels no fresh sheets etc, she said no no it is cleaned up, I told her to tell her boss that I will never visit that premises again and he should be ashamed and promptly blocked her number.

The trouble with the ads is that the pics are just too unbelievable , there is no way youw ill get girls that look like that that charge  very little and supposedly will take it all BB.

Not for me ever ever again !

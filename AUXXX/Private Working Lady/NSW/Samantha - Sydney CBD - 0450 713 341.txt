My experience/comments : 

Okay fellow punters, sorry for the break in posts as i was on a punting break for a bit long (got a FWB arrangement and now that is gone so back to punting)

So she advertised as indian mix in cracker, pics were blurred but liked what i saw (i like women with bit of meat). Shoot her a text and was easy to arrange. Gave the hotel details and got there. She just literally had got there. 

So she is Tongan and works only some days but other days i think a canadian and an african works from there(she tried to hook me on to it later), but has a great rack and ass(OMG still getting hard thinking of it). Face is a bit islander so not the best looking face but was okay for me. Sorted the finance and had the shower. 

Super friendly girl started off with DFK and me exploring her great rack. jumped onto the bed and after a bit of playing around, she gets onto a good BBBJ and that was a good one (she was into it and i like when the lady spits and sucks again) 

Down for some DATY, nice pussy to eat but ass a bit smelly (BBW girls and summer so cant complain). She goes off in 5 mins but doesnt seem to be tired, so i soldier on, twice and after that time for dom and hitting that flooded tunnel. Warm pussy and i liked it, pump in various positions for some time and back onto 69. Not sure if i came on her face or boobs but it was all over it. 

Lay down for some time, and onto round 2 (was not having the energy to pump her again)  69 massage and cuddles was round 2.

Overall a happy chap

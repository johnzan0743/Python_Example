Post Content: 
Person's Name : Sharon

Establishment : Private in Riverwood, but also does regular circuits of rural NSW

Date of Visit : Nov 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : BUSTY MATURE Aussie Blonde for passionate fun in ROSELANDS area until Sunday - Sydney escorts - backpage.com.au

Hours of Business : 10.30 AM UNTIL LATE

Rates : $120/30 mins

Age : Says 49, more like 60 though

Size/shape : Short with hips and boobs, but not as plump as the photos would indicate

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian

Services Provided : DFK, BBBJ, CIM

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Apparently Sharon plied her trade in Surry Hills for some time, but is now a roving PWL. Her Sydney base is a public housing block very close to the M5 in Riverwood, and she also does tours of the country regions. She reminds me of a blonde Katherine Helmond from "Soap". She chats a lot and is a bit eccentric, but has a lovely nature, and is no slouch in the cot either. Great boobs with less sag than one might expect, nice skin, sweet pussy and great oral technique done to completion. She's no spring chicken, and will say as much when you phone her. But for anyone who prefers their ladies aged like fine wine, Sharon is a wonderful experience

Thanks for the review. I called her once and she was emphatic about no French kissing. Can you confirm she was ok with it?

Yes, she was
I didn't ask about it on the phone
It just kinda happened after we were in bed together for a while
She doesn't mention it in her ad, so maybe I was just lucky

Cool, thanks for the info. From memory she talked about germs and such, and seemed quite clearly against it.

But I'll take a shot

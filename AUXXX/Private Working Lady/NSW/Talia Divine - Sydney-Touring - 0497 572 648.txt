My experience/comments :

Sent Talia a text and arranging an appointment was no drama.
Talia is a lovely young girl and it is rare I have a half way kind of experience.  For me they are usually really good or bad.
But I had this kind of time with her.  She is a beautiful girl.  Taller than I thought and her boobs are real.  
In her photos on PG she must be wearing some kind of wonder bra as they jut out and look fake.
During the meeting I was thinking she must be using fake photos but after going home after the session and looking at the pics on the website again they are definitely real.
She looks different in real life (longer legs and real boobs and not as toned) but just as good if not better than pics.


We chatted for a bit then started some nice passionate kissing.  Moved to bed room and I went down on her / she went down on me.  Nice eye contact and very good BBBJ technique.
Slipped on the dom went through a few possies.  She was fine - nothing to complain about at all but she just didn't float my boat for some reason.
Not sure exactly why.  There are not many reviews on her around so I would be interested in somebody else's perspective if they are game but for me for $700 I guess I want to be blown away.

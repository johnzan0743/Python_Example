My experience/comment:

Decided, for shits and giggles, that I would trawl Port Kembla this arvo and see what street performers were out. Had never had a street punt before, so this was all very exciting.

Saw one up near the BP servo that looked like She was on meth or something. Did another loop and was gonna pick Her up for fun, but couldn't find Her. Parked my car out of the way, went for a walk and bumped into Rachel. A deal was made, I went and got my car, picked Her up then went to one of Her spots. Might pay to mention at this point, She was very open and seemingly honest about, well everything really. Got along really well with Her. So anyway, we reach the spot, I get out, She comes around and gives me a play.

Oh my, Her slightly weathered face had drawn my attention away from Her curvy arse, big boobs and super-smooth skin. She started sucking away and, despite barbecuing alone A LOT lately (GF's away) She got me hard again. I asked how much to let me fuck Her, extra $20 and She was bent over the bonnet of my car. I pumped and grinded away while enjoying Her arse, and Her movements, and before long I was spent all over again.

On the way back to Her spot, She explained that She does give Her phone number out. Wish I had grabbed it now. She doesn't work after 8pm as She reckons police are out after that hour. I found Her at about 5:20pm. There were 3 others working at the same time. 

I took a risk with a street walker and ended up having the best punt I've ever had. And my second non-Asian girl in a row. If I had Her number, I would go get Her, bring Her to my place, get Her showered, then just fuck Her for as long as my last ATM withdrawal would allow. Get Her before She realises what She's worth!

Hey mate. She had a reddish-brown pony tail, white skin, busty. She really didn't look like much from afar. Or even up close. Until the clothes came off. She also "seemed" like a real genuine, straight up kind of person. But, could have been a facade for what it's worth.

She sounded like She knew the other workers so I guess you could ask one of them for Her? Post Her number if you get it >

This "backpack" girl, I've never heard of? She could be the metho-looking chick I saw standing at the top of wentworth st.

I've not been to Port Kembla in years but I think you'll find "backpack girl" is mentioned elsewhere.

Used to be a couple of girls hitch hiking between warrawong and windang and give you the play when they got in the car. Haven't seen them for a while though.

I only ever saw backpack girl once. She always has a backpack hence the name - the day I saw her she had a very short tartan skirt. Apparently she is a great root.

The meth looking one could be the red/brown short hair girl, it was shaven hair once and she looks scary.

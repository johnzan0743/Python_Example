there is something about a pregnant female body 
communication was easy and was given the address to a house in Roselands. i arrive and got the impression there were others in the house which is always unnerving but it was fine probably her husband or something..lol. is a friendly bubbly personality nice pregnant body and handful of titties.  showered and got ready on the bed so it but a bit disorganized took a while to get started but the time didnt start until we were on the bed. BBBJ was good fairly one paced though and had to tell her to slow down to not blow early. on with the rubber but unfortunately said she could only do missionary, the sex was fairly standard just pumping here in mish but good enough. partially ticked one of the bucket list though didn't try lactating...

Not super interested in a pregnant wl but I do have on my bucket list wanting to sample the taste of mother's milk. Almost had this years ago with a beautiful lady at Tiffany's but the punter before me had already sucked her dry and she never did another shift there afterwards.

I had very similar experience to the original poster....he has described her very accurately so i have not bothered repeating in another template.

She is 7 months pregnant tall pretty and friendly....normally that would make for a great punt...but it just wasnt, she tried but it was SO mechanical ... and insisting on missionary killed it for me...i like pregnant girls on top with their tummy resting on me and swollen tits bouncing...mish just flattens everything out!

The other people in the house are her family not her husband .. couple of dogs too

Nothing much further to add.

It is so frustrating when the WL is reasonably attractive yet very mechanical and boring in the session. She promised me milk yet when i get there I would have needed a pump to get any out..

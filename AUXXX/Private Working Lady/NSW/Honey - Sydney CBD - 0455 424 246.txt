My experience/comments :

I've had my eye on Honey ever since she started advertising a few weeks back in my never-ending pursuit of the perfect dirty punt. For the price she advertised, it was only an inevitability. So some extra funds are loaned out from the punting bank (I've already gone well over budget this month like always!) and a booking is made. 

A dirty punt was paid for but was it received? Well, I guess you should ask yourself if you think the Pope is Catholic.

In fact, the only hiccup was trying to get into her place as she works out of a fairly busy serviced apartment and whilst we were trying to figure out the lifts just about every man, woman, child, and dog had come to wait with me! That minor frustration was soon forgotten when we finally got into her room and I was pleasantly greeted by the sight of Honey's tiny body enveloped in cheap fishnets and a pretty little thong. This girl was going to get a proper thrashing. 

We chill and talk in the kitchen for a bit before handling finances. Usually at this point, I suss out how submissive the WL really is and what the punt is realistically going to be like and all lights were green so far (I find that if you can chat a bit before handing over money than that is always a good sign). After having a quick splash, Honey is standing and waiting for me against the wall still dressed. I push her up against the wall by the throat (firm but not too hard of course) and we gently make out before whispering in her ear that her cunt belongs to me and that failing to please me will lead to swift punishment. She murmurs an agreement and I lift her tiny frame so her pussy is in my face and carry her to the couch before laying her down in pile driver position. I challenge her the put her feet behind her head but she is not quite flexible enough so a quick firm slap to her inner thigh is applied as punishment. The sight of her in this position as well as her pussy lips wrapped around her thong and fishnets is too much for me and, with her permission, I tear her fishnets open, part her thong, and begin to feast on her cunt. Eventually I lift her up and throw her on the bed (I don't have super human strength or something, she just weighs nothing). 

What followed was some seriously hard and dirty fucking the likes of which put this up with my top 3 punts of all time. 

At the end of the session I asked Honey if she would like be reviewed and she said yes but not to disclose all the details. Out of respect, I won't mention everything we did as I don't want to set expectations and as always YMMV but I'll leave you with that intro and let your imagination conjure up the rest. What is clear is that Honey went above and beyond to satisfy me and was a real trooper - let's just say as a tiny girl she was very accommodating and didn't complain too much; that's a true sub there. 

Treat her well and she'll treat you even better 

Cheers

Bad idea mentioning reviews. Have a look at this thread for reasons why.

Yeah I agree nextlife, normally I'm hesitant bringing up reviews and forums with WL but she seemed cool with it - her service was definitely worth reviewing. I think the key is that punters always  remember YMMV and use their instincts at the start of the session to scope out what they can and can't do.

One thing I know for certain from experience, is that your instincts cant tell you how a WL will react to being told about reviews. Russian Roulette mate....

So you do this regularly? Have you told any other ladies about this Forum?

Bad idea herb. Have a look at the thread that Nextlife suggested. The topic has been talked about plenty here.

There is not one good reason for discussing forum reviews with a sex worker... even those who advertise widely. What is the point, other than stroking a male ego? Further... for massage shop workers... NEVER EVER discuss with them.

herb98, notwithstanding that she may have been "cool with it" it is a cardinal sin to do this. Please take note! Never do this.

Think I've only ever mentioned it to two other WL, I never bother mentioning the name of the websites though - I just say that they were great and that I'll write a review for them as some sort of lame bonus for their efforts (not for favours or anything as others apparently do). 

I actually thought I was being helpful - rookie error I suppose :S

In hindsight, maybe what I wrote was quite explicit but it was a fucking amazing session

Did it ever occur to you that a lot of women don't want reviews? For some this is a private service for them to make cash, not be posted about all over the internet, they prefer discretion.<br>
For the sake of the rest of us, and not scaring away potential talent, never ever mention reviews to a worker.

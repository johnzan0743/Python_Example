[COLOR=#333333]Value for money/recommend? : absolutely not, do NOT call this number.  [/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments : classic bait and switch.  the girl i saw is not the one in the pictures.  to be fair i kind of knew i wouldnt be seeing the girl in those pictures but i went anyway.  usual deal, sent text asking for dianas availability.  got a text back from a different number, and another text back from some kind of weird numerical email confirming diana does bbbj and cim.  then my phone rings, a different number again.  it sounds like an older lady pretending to be diana.  im cool with that, just how some operations function.  so i confirm the time, and off i go.  

when i get there (haymarket) i make contact and go up.  girl who opens the door is very clearly not the girl in the photos.  but she isnt terrible, i proceed.  she spoke ok english, had no issues communicating.  she did try to giggle after each thing she said, felt extremely rehearsed.  i got the vibe this wasnt her ideal career choice, which for the young asians is usually the case.  i hand over the 250 and she directs me to the shower.  when i get back we lay on the very hard bed and she doesnt do anything.  im a shy guy so i didnt do anything either.  couple minutes pass.  finally she seems to decide to get going on me down below.  then she asks if i want a condom so she can blow me, and i explain the text messages and my understanding of her service. whole exchange was pleasant if not a little awkward, but she goes on to say she never does it without a condom ever, its impossible.  she says its an extra 20.  i say im ok with that but i didnt bring extra cash on me.  

so we are both there on the bed for another few moments of silence.  then i say ok so what now?  then she almost mumbles a bunch of stuff then seems to reluctantly agree to go ahead and blow me without a condom.  her attitude from there was a bit ordinary.  the whole time i felt like i had just been ripped off $250 and so easily could have gone to see another girl who i know.  felt like such a dumbass..  so she is blowing me, and its the absolute worse blowjob ive ever had ever. ever ever ever.  the worst.  she kept stopping to fix herself up, get tissues, etc.  almost the entire hour passed and i couldnt close the deal.  finally her phone starts to make noise and she says the time is up but says she will keep going on me for another couple minutes as that may be enough.  it wasnt.  she stops and starts to cough into some tissues.  so i take that opportunity to quickly finish myself off.  i manage to rather easily. at least i got one off i guess, so it wasnt a complete waste of time.  although i had to do it so she does not get any points.  

i cant blame the girl here, its the operation she works under.  ive seen another asian girl in the same building before, and it was a similar story.  im pretty sure they get a crash course in hookering and there probably isnt a lot of communication of what services they do or should offer.  or its all a scam and the idea is to say no till we drop more cash once we are in the apartment.  either way it was a total waste of money and i feel ripped off and stupid for letting myself fall for an obvious bait and switch.  in hind sight i think i should have asked her point blank what she will and wont do BEFORE i actually hand over the cash, because then id have a chance to just get up and walk out.[/COLOR]

That was not very good of them, you should ring them back and complain and also put comments on the Cracker Advertisement.

You would get much better service from Ginza or other Asian brothels.

Hi HH. I suspect young morloch has learnt a valuable lesson from this and well done to him for posting on a bad punt.

However, I think you'll find there are many good value and genuine pwls working in Sydney that charge similar rates.

You certainly dont have to go up the price scale to get top shelf service.  As for sticking to brothels, unless you choose carefully its my experience that you can be ripped of just as much by a shop.

And it sounds like morlochs experience was in fact one of a number of mobile shops that move from apartment to apartment to dodge whatever they perceive to be following them.

It's not called punting for nothing. Thanks to morloch we now have another phone number to be wary of. Emp

Right-on.

Punt as often as you please, but please post, for better or for worse, as often as you do.

But it is not necessary that your posts always be of sad times. To avoid the sads you can,

1 Use this forum to the hilt: go to those with good recent reviews, avoid those with none or mainly bad reviews.

2 Don't think things will look up. Before handing over your money, if things don't feel right, think about that urgent work you need to do at the office, that appointment you'd almost forgotten about, and say firmly, "This is not what I expected" and walk.

3 Treat people well. 

Don't give providers excuses to treat you poorly. Look as good as if you are going for a new job or a hot date.

I'm sure others can add more to this.

At the end of the day we are customers. In the same way one would complain if that which was offered was not as advertised , I feel nothing in saying "sorry , this was not as I was led to believe".. be polite , say no thanks and walk its as simple as that. I for one work too hard to earn an income to be spun a story.. maybe its cos I am 55 years old and have learnt not to take nonsense from anyone.
cheers

Good review Morloch.  Was it $250 for an hour or half an hour?  I can only suggest going to a better known incall company where sure it will be $300 plus per hour but for the extra $50 you don't usually get the problem of the girl not knowing the service to deliver or pretending not to know but happily asking for more when you ask.  Plus you can see the girl from the photo as well.  Also, they normally want repeat business so if there is an issue with the girl they would at least discuss it with you.  It seems like the one you went to is just after some quick money and knows most guys won't be back.

loads of great points here.  it was $250 for an hour.  ive been burned before but this time was somehow very different.  as i was laying on the bed i really seriously felt like wow i just totally blew that $250 that i worked hard for, and for what?  i wanted to just get up and walk without my money without anything, i was just so disappointed that despite the industry it is, you can get so screwed over.  i have a feeling ive dealt with this mob before and quite frankly id rather just not go anywhere near them again than try and complain or make an issue out of it.  the point of this post was to alert other guys just like me or guys with less experience than me from making my mistake.  ive seen plenty of fine ladies over the past year and ive had a pretty good strike rate in terms of getting what i paid for.  

for the record my other 2 dodgy incidents occured in the same apartment block on sussex street.

Hilarious how things can go from "never ever" to "$20 extra" to "OK then".

Sorry to hear about your dud punt morloch, but many thanks for the review as these dud punt reviews are as valuable (if not more so) than the good reviews.

Also agree EMP. Can I suggest Pinky as a good WYSIWYG private at a lower price than this and with a much better service.

There's a sure fire way to avoid bad situations like this:  Google Images

If the pics are fake, and 99% on Cracker are, then they are lying b'stards who don't deserve your dollars, so don't do it. Simple as that.

Oh, and Diana apparently looks exactly like Aimee who is a Japanese escort in London, UK Aimee from City Of London - Female Escort

Tinyeye is a good resource.

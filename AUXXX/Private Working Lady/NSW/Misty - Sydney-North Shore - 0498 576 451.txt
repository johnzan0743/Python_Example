[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments:[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]After discovering Misty's advertisement on cracker.com.au yesterday morning and having experienced her at Amanda Heavens, I fortunate enough to secure sometime with her last night. As its an outcall service only, you have to think ahead and book ahead to ensure that you have a hotel room sorted etc. [/COLOR]We went out for dinner first and the GFE was other wordly! I have never met anyone that can make you feel so special and so relaxed and so ready to go back to your hotel room!

[COLOR=#333333]Rather than rehash my feelings about the hotel room portion of last night, you can read my original thoughts here: [/COLOR]http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f190/misty-probably-my-best-act-going-paying-having-sex-gamble-ever-13369   . Let me just add that I have never been with anyone like her and doubt I ever will again. There is not one thing I would change about last night (except maybe the empty wallett ).
[COLOR=#333333]
I will be going back again![/COLOR]

Exactly she's  having herself on, but if punters want to pay it good luck to her

Sorry, but either way, don't we all work to make money and try to increase our earnings at every opportunity?? When was the last time you guys re negotiated your salaries or changed jobs to get more money?? Why can't working ladies do the same thing?? Trust me, she's worth every cent...................

there seems to be a general consensus here that paulmack22 is indeed Misty herself.. 

we like to take the opportunity for paulmack22 to PM Admin and Moderation team before the posts and accounts are deleted as it contravenes our forum code for advertising..

Whilst its awesome to see a lady "make it" its a bummer to see a lady exponentially put her prices up. And for those who do want to see her its now a case of a sometime thing and not an all the time thing. 

I hope that privates don't exponentially put their prices up for the sake of their perceived popularity.

I'm left wondering just how much disposable income one would need to consider $500 per hour good value? I mean, I'm not exactly poor yet I would never even consider paying that much for one punt, not when 219 is around the corner anyway.

Having seen Misty twice i am devastated at the move but I think it's fair to look at the move from her side. At AH she hardly had the time for a break so a decision on her part to charge more and do potentially less is a call she's entitled to make to reduce turnover by maintain income?

Yes your right Amandas really uses the girls up, so why not double the price and have half the clientele

I think it is the environment and competitive nature at AH.. There canbe so many girls on at the one time.. That they have to "work" for it or else lose clients and business to maintain the statua quo..

So your saying that @Misty wasn't the "bottom bitch". Judging from the reviews and subsequent move I'd say she was. 

Fair enough that its gonna be a competitive environment yet it all depends on the girl cos the only thing Amanda should care about is the activity of the girls. If they aint active, the girls and Amanda lose out. 

I'd say @Misty became a victim of her own success and now is cashing in on it. Too bad she hiked up her prices cos I would have seen her at her own establishment

She's entitled to charge as much as she likes, however, it will only be a matter of time that business will slow up considerably at $500 a pop,
Clients that were prepared to see her once a week, may wait an extra week before they see her again, and any potential client will balk at her asking price.

Perhaps it's the perception of half the clients for the same take home amount and a better standard of client at the same time?

.................just noticed Misty has surfaced again and the price is now $350/hour.............way more affordable, which means way more trips for me..............

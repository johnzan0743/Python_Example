My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)  Have been eyeing off Julianna for a long time. Finally made the call. 
booking was easy and location is easy with parking. 

settled on the massage with hj.

rocked up and opening the door, stunning sexy woman in hot red lingerie. Score. Hard already.  Make way to bedroom. Sort out the finances and ask for relief upfront and second after massage. Just brings a cheeky smile to her face and expertly starts rubbing my cock.  Undoes her bra and most awesome tit fuck until blows all over her chest. Great start

into the massage which is firm and good,  a proper massage.  Would you like to turn over and off into round 2.  This time sitting on top rubbing my cock on he clit while she strokes me with her other hand. Great sight watching those beautiful c cups bounce up and down. Blow my load shower and off

fantastic lady who knows how to please. Will definitely see again and probably take the full service 1hr option. She's a machine.

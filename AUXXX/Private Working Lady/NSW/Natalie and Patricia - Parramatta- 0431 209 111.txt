[/COLOR][COLOR=rgb(51, 51, 51)]My experience/comments : Another terrible experience. Had a day off and the thought of spending some quick time with 2 girls had forced me into finding this ad. Unfortunately didnt find any reviews, so decided to take a chance. Called up and booked an appointment. She sounded very keen on confirming the time and could kind of give a hint that this was going to be bad. Still went on and reached their place.. Was a new apartment kind of isolated behind a construction site - around East parramatta. Was asked to enter through the parking lot and given directions. 

Was pretty disappointed on seeing them both. Not attractive. no way close to whats on the pics. Too late to back off, just paid and continued. And they weren't lesbos ! Undressed and lay on the bed. Both were very quick to undress and touch and rub me. One was focusing on my chest and the other on riding me with the dom. I was like what the crap.. And this artificial moan was irritating. There was no service in fact. They don't let you kiss, no other stuff thats mentioned on the ad. Was a total rip off. Just came quick and was rushed a bit. Then realised they had made the next guy wait at the entrance. And while i was getting ready, they brought him in to another room and continued this shit with him probably after i left !!

Terrible experience.. Would never go back again ![/COLOR]

Never too late to walk if you've clearly been deceived, I suggest -- but I know what it's like when you've built up your expectations and just want to blow within the next (half) hour instead of scrambling to find an alternative.

I never used to walk. But I did it once last year when I was in Perth for work. A lady advertised as 24 and was about 46. I walked in the low lights and eventually I knew I was conned, she got me out of my clothes fast and on with a dom for BJ and I said. NO your add said 24. I walked and I felt good about it.
Once you do it once you can do it again. I was polite about of course. Trust me you can do it.

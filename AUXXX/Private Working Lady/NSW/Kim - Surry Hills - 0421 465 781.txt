 Value for money/recommend? : Not really

I rang Kim and she picked up straight away, and seemed friendly and helpful on the phone. We made a booking for an hour or so later but when the time came, she kept pushing back saying she's sorry but she was still with someone, 10 more minutes.... This lasted for a good hour until I was about to leave and she said she was ready. She agreed to slightly reduce the price so I begrudgingly accepted. 

Upon meeting her, she was very shy and quiet but cute. She's probably 21 or 22 but still hasn't truly come out of her shell.

After some awkward silences, she shows me the shower. Get back in and she's still shy and quiet. I pay her the money and she asks what I'm into. I told her I was interested in her squirting and she obliged. I think you need to take control with her and once I realised that, the session flowed well.

She came a few times with fingering and penetration. Her BBBJ was mechanical, she was a reluctant kisser and once I came about 15 minutes in on her breasts, she told me our time was up even though I had at least 15 minutes left and she already kept me waiting for so long. 

I couldn't be bothered arguing as I wasn't really feeling it. She was attractive and nice, but her service and communication skills need improving and she needs to come out of her shell more.

By the way, she's from Melbourne and is touring here in between stints there I think.

May I make a suggestion, assuming this has not been done before, but if it has then I am sorry for my ignorance.

Moderators and members, how beneficial for punters if we had a section called, duds, or word/s to that effect where there is a list that punters can elect to have WL's who fail to deliver in any area such that a punter is short changed or any other reason so we can keep a check on girls that fail.

Name and shame them and deprive them of business they do not deserve.

I don't think this is a good idea.

One man's dud is another's future wife.

A thread with mixed reviews, and most are, allows the punter to easily make an informed decision.

She is attractive and has a cute, baby face look.

She wasn't a dud as such, just a bit timid and quiet. Maybe she comes out of her shell the more you see her. 

The quick clock and keeping me waiting were definite issues though

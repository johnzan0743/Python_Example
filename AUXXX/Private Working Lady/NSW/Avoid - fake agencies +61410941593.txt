My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)
I found myself checking Skokka site as my work finished super early today.
Found few different ads with pretty photos which i knew were fakes (too good to be true).
Since i had nothing to do, i had an idea to expose few agencies in Sydney CBD to my fellow punters here.
I txted many different numbers and selected 3 numbers claiming to be in 278 or 267 Sussex St.
As i suspected they were all sort of agency where different girls share apartment unit perhaps on roaster but who cares. I did walk into 2 different units and within seconds i walked out as they lady was totally different from the photo.

So my fellow punters, if you call or txt and get a reply that they are in 278 or 257 Sussex Street, as you suspected they are fake.
This was kinda fun and sad at the same time.
Maybe i will explore those agencies in haymarket and china town area such as 8 dixon st. or 6 little hay st.
I have had experienced fake agency and legit private escort under same address (different units) so there may be a chance of the escort being real but as we all know, chances will be slim.

Thanks for reading guys
Hope you have a good punt

I can add the top floor if 6 little hay street is similar bullshit. I called and made an appointment which was confirmed when I got there I texted requesting apt number only to be told hang on babe I'm in the shower.... I retried after 10 min... hang on babe I'm drying my hair.. I replied I was leaving in 3 minutes... 3 minutes later I drove away, 2 minutes after that I got a text with the unit number saying I'm ready for u.. being very weak willed I turned around and parked near uts then walked to #6 pressed the unit number went up and was greeted by the girl in the photo, well ok not her but possibly her grandmother who was still panting from the mad rush she has done to get there , she asked for 250, I showed her the photo and let myself out ... waste of my time and hers

 0434649579 Colombian Dana FAKE

0434649579 is a fake, posing as Colombian Dana, I asked for a selfie and they even sent me one, I thought it was a bit fake but still proceeded after I told the person on the phone that if it's not the person then I'm walking out, they replied with '100% real'. When I turned up it was an Asian girl, she wasn't bad looking but I was pissed off just on the principle, told her it wasn't her on the photo, she tried to get a room mate, but she was asleep, I can only assume she was another Asian girl, rather than this magical girl from the photo. Then she tried to lower the price, I said no and walked out pissed off.

Just sucks to have to always be thinking 'is this girl a fake?' in the back of your mind. Next time I will stipulate that if she's fake then I get service for free. See how that goes....

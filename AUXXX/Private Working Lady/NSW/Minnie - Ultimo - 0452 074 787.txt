My experience/comments : 
Had a wonderful time with Minnie last night. Saw her ad on locanto (https://m.locanto.com.au/sydney/ID_2...-OUT-CALL.html) and decided to give her a call. She was very prompt to respond, we fixed up a time for 8pm, she works from her private apartment around ultimo. 
Upon arrival i was greeted by this very petite girl, wearing only her red panties and a pair of nipple stickers. She was very friendly and in no time her tiny good sized breasts were in my hands. I took off my shoes and handed her the reward and She guided me upstairs to the bathroom where she joined me.
We fooled around for a bit in the shower and she went down on me (covered) got a pretty decent bj. I was rock hard within minutes and i pulled her up bend her over and had her from behind. She's a good moaner, as i was pounding from behind with the shower still running didn't take me long to cum. We cleaned up and headed to the bed. She was too keen on dfk, but i avoided it, she seems to be a heavy smoker and her breath was a bit bad, so i sticked to light lip kissing. 
She had a massage table and for the next 20 mins or so she gave a nice back rub, then i turned over as i was ready for round two. She oiled me up and gave a second cbj, and it was a good one.

Then i ploughed her in few different positions but unfortunately i couldn't finish,  but she didn't gave up. I was a bit over my time, but she went ahead and tried to finish me off with a hj, and yeah she succeeded.  Overall very pleasant experience.  A friendly,  polite and unrushed service.  Definitely recommend. 

Cheers!
Joe

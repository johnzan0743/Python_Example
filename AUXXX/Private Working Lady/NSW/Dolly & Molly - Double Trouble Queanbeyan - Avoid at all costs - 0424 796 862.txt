My experience/comments : You can shear a sheep many times but you can only skin it once. I definitely have been skinned here and I definitely will not recommend anyone go near this advertiser and have learned my lesson on this one. 
This ad had several photos of some extremely gorgeous young and hot looking Asian girls advertising a double for $200 for 30 mins with BBBJ. I thought that was not bad value for money and might be worth the 30 min drive to Queanbeyan. I am always a little bit skeptical of the asian ads so I texted to confirm if the girls in the photo would be the girls and I am meeting and confirming the BBBJ. All was confirmed and I excitedly drove to Queanbeyan (via the ATM though)...

When I got there I was greeted by a rather hot looking woman although she was definitely not 22 and definitely not from the photos in the ad. Nevertheless I proceeded and she how long and I said 30 mins double and she said that will be $250. I questioned that and said the ad said $200 for 30 mins. She immediately started flicking through her phone and then said no it was only 20 mins for $200. I didn't bring my phone in to the motel with me so I couldn't show her the ad to prove it and then I said how much for just one lady for 30 mins which she replied $130. So I was about to just do her for the 30 mins but relented and really wanted the double so I agreed to 20 mins for $200.

So she calls another girl in to the room who is also obviously not from the pictures in the ad but probably in her early to mid 30s but she was sexy and had a nice body so stupid me did not protest and just went with it.

So the first girl starts stroking my arm while the second girl head for my cock with a condom in hand. So I immediately said the ad said the blowjob was bareback/natural. She said no it's condom only. Right there and then I should have just got up and walked out but they already had my money so that would have been stupid so I just tried to make the most of the situation. The blowjob wasn't too bad though with a condom but then the first one said blowjob only and then I insisted and said no I'm going to fuck both of you. So after a bit I said to the one sucking my cock lets fuck. So she laid down on the bed missionary style and I inserted my cock slowly in to her. Her pussy hole was very tight but nice and wet so I fucked her and while I was fucking her the other one was stroking my back, arms, bum and balls. So after a little while I said to the other one it's your turn to be fucked so off went the condom and on with another one and again she went on to the missionary position. She was tight too and I fucked her hard while the other one also started caressing me all over. Anyway cutting to the chase I said I wanted to finish with a double wank job... and with a week's worth of cum I spurted my cum high in to the air.... and over their hands and arms.... It was funny watching the first one put her hand near the top of my cock when I was cumming as the first squirt went over me and on to the bed... ha ha have fun cleaning that up you scamming bitches...

Anyway I've learned my lesson... Next time a WL tries to con me but not being what's advertised I'm going to grow some balls and just leave before I hand over any of my hard earned cash.... Fellas I definitely wouldn't recommend this advertiser... if there was a "Fair Trading Dept" for prostitutes I would be definitely complaining about this pair.....

Thanks for the review ... almost booked them yesterday too... but their reply was to slow for my journey ... also I was alerted to the scam as the address for several ads came back the same .. all stunning photos.. old adage if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!

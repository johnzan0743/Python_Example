Saw this stunning photo on Locanto. Texted and confirmed for shower, bbbj and FS for $170. Went to the motel on Queen Street, Campbelltown. Girl wasn's the girl in the photo. Average looking but friendly enough.

Settled the finances and we both went into the shower. OK shower on the tub. She got her hair wet in the process and after I finished the shower she had a bath and she used this to waste a considerable amount of time including drying her hair. By the time we got into the bed about 20 minutes have passed since my arrival.

She offered a BBBJ with hot water for a tip of $50. This wasn't in the agreement, but I said yes. She got some hot water in a cup and did a reasonable BBBJ with the hot water in her mouth. I liked this and this was the highlight of this punt. My member was hard and she asked whether I wanted a CIM or sex. I said CIM first and after a massage sex. She said I could only come once. I opted for more suck and sex. More suck only lasted another 3 minutes and she domed me up for the final act. I asked her to go on top. A few minutes of very weak grinding she asked me to go for it. I finished in Misc. The massage to follow was well below average and short. As a gentleman who keeps his word, I paid up the $50.

When I had a shower and got out I still had another 10 minutes of my hour.

Michelle is an average looking girl who uses a faked photo on Locanto. Her services are well below average and price high. She wastes the time and short sells you on time. The ad says 21 years, but more like 31.

I had a long stretch of good punting lately and this is my time to have a poor one.

As you can see from the photo below, I got fooled by it. Wouldn't you?

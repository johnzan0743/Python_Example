My experience/comments : 

Erika was easy to communicate with via text. Although, I had to wait outside her place for about 20 minutes before I got the OK to come upstairs. Erika is located in the CBD / Woolloomooloo. I found that in person, she seemed prettier (or had a more natural beauty) than her profile images tend to show, so I was quite happy to see her. It was a little rushed to start off with, just ushering me into the shower, but once I came out, things went at a nice pace. bit of touching and kissing before she went slowly to her knees and proceeded to give me the best damn bj of my life, it was artful, very deep, slow and intense and she knew how to control her mouth so that everything she did with it felt good. 

Eventually, we went back to kissing, I went down on her but she didn't seem much into it, so after a while we proceeded to sex. I must say that I didn't hold out for as long as I wanted to, in doggy she has a good way of pushing back that got me too excited. We had a nice friendly chat about random stuff afterward and despite finishing early, I have repeatedly thought back to that blowjob, so it was a definite positive experience in my book

She does seem to have an issue with being on time. On the basis of this review, I arranged to meet her at 11am last Sunday for a 1hr session. Could not get an answer when I texted at 10.30 for her address. She finally texted me at 11.15 to say she'd have to reschedule - to 4pm that day! No explanation, no apology. I think she'd simply forgotten about me. So I said no thanks. A real shame.

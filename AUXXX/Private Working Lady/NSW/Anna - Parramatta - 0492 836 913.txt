Saw Anna instead

I can't find the original ad probably because this is a bait & switch operation
Some example ads (based on "Korean" with "verified" photos and the same prices) are:
Example1
Example2
Example3

My experience/comments :

Location is a modern apartment in Parra. Parking was easy on a Sunday but it'll be harder/more expensive on a weekday. There was no air conditioner in the room I was in so it was pretty hot.

I rocked up expecting to meet Becca, a slim & seemingly attractive Korean. Instead I was introduced to Juri, a chubby Korean. She offered to introduce me to the other girl that was there who was Anna, a slim and busty Malaysian who I thought was quite pretty.

While Anna's body was great, her service was anything but. Average CBJ only, starfish, she tried to get me off ASAP, no massage or shower offered before or after. She definitely just wanted to get me out ASAP and I didn't want to hang around someone who obviously didn't want me around. All up I think I was there for only 20 minutes and say 5 minutes was a shower after...

So this was clearly a bait and switch on the day I visited. I suspect these ads just put up photos of the most attractive in the group to get "verified" photos. It possible the advertised girl doesn't even work there.

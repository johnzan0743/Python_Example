Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : It doesn't take long to develop a keen eye for a add with fake photos but I thought I would give this one the benefit of the doubt despite being baited before.
The lady insisted the booking was to be made via sms only, ok fair enough but still a red flag for me.
I arrive at a modern looking block of serviced apartments in Oxford st Bondi Junction and hoped that the lady that was about to greet me was the one in the photos, a hot little nymph,
I wasn't holding my breath though. The door opens and an Asian girl ushers me to the bedroom from which point I got my phone out and pointed to the girl in the photos.
Not surprisingly and much to my chagrin she said the girl was not available today but that she was available. I couldn't help the deflated feeling and walked out, burned again.
Plenty of this stuff going round I guess.

Cheers

You’re absolutely right. There’s far too much of this bait and switch going on. You’re right to leave. On the occasion I have stayed I’ve always been disappointed. The only way to stop this is to leave otherwise they’ll just continue. In the end I’ve given up on this type of ad.

Looking at this ad the bullshit meter is ringing wildly. No verified photos, for illustration purposes only. Ethnicity is at least listed as Chinese.

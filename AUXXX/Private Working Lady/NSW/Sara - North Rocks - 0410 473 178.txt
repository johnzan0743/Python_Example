My experience/comments : The local thai place had a new girl who looked ok. My guess from here photos is the three in similar lingerie are not her - the boob shot specifically. The two photos that look the same as her.

Booking was easy. Getting into the building is also easy as it is security outside for cars but you can park outside and walk in. Do not need to be buzzed up to the floor. 

Greeted by a slim girl with rather amazing long hair. Go to the room and sort out gratuities before jumping in the shower. Opted to wash myself. Back to the room to wait while she has a freshen up then down to business. Asks if I want extras, no thanks not today. Start with some cat bath which was ok but no kissing. Pushed her off and got her lubricated before getting on top and giving her a go. Looks wise she was cute, small cups with medium bullet nipples, a decent ass and slim legs. She did have  C scar of sorts, but because she was slim it was not too saggy and offputting. The sex was ok with a little too much foam for my tastes. Her english seemed quite good and easy to understand.

Overall she was nice, not amazing but worth what she was charging. Worth a look if in the area but not worth going out of your way for.

Josh18 such a cryptic smart alec comments and lack of detail are totally unfitting on this forum, especially for a Silver member. Your lack of help has been noted by the moderators and membership.

unclepj I suggest you ring the mobile and ask as I doubt the OP will be helpful.

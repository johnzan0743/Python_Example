Gracie is a slim, stunning lady who works privately.
She was easy to text and arrange a meet in the east of Sydney one evening.
She was beautifully dressed in tight pants and heels, she is slim, small breasted with blonde hair and a very pretty face. After i showered she was dressed in lingerie and we kissed passionately, she worked to my nipples and on her knees in front of the mirror, sucking my balls and my cock with fervour. I went down on her, she took some time to warm up before eventually i felt the first trickle of orgasm and then she started to writhe and grip the sheets and got right into it.
I fucked her from behind, looking into the mirror and pulling her ponytail, on her back as well but she really came into her own when she was on top, she rode hard and came twice in that position , the first and second time we fcuked.
She isn't cheap but a quality lady, very hot in my opinion, the physique i like, slim, small breasted, easy to talk to.

How about a review so we can all share the experience rather than just comments? 

nswpunter - You are at risk of losing your bronze status - where are your four reviews for the last year?

Haven't punted since 2017 and haven't seen Ellie Chase. Just going off Twitter selfies.

When I book her, will review and get back on the horse. Just back to figure out who

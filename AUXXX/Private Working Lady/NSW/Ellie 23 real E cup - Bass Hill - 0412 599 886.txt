Value for money/recommend? : I guess so. 

My experience/comments : Another Asian that uses false information. I took a photo on my phone of the ad on backpage. Texting was quite quick in response. I drove to the hotel on the hume highway. Knocked on the door and Ellie answered. Well, I showed the woman the picture and asked her "is this you? She said "Yes , 10 years ago". Interesting, So she advertises as a23 year old and modelled at 13 years of age with the biggest set of E cups in the photo. In person they were fake DD's. She would easily be late 30's or early 40's. I asked her is kissing allowed. $50 she quoted. Fuck that. She asked if I wanted to stay 1 hr, I said if you kissed I would consider it . Sorry darling was her response. OK , I'm here now. Had the shower and got out and picked her up with her legs wrapped around my back while I suckled on her nipples. Dropped her on the bed and continued devouring her fake tits. We were in the missionary position and I was pushing little Zorro's head against her pussy lips but Ellie was all safe. Rain coat on , half a tube of lubricant, 10 minutes of pistoning in the missionary position and blasted 5 days worth into the bag. 20 minutes gone and I'm asking for a round two and she responds with "Shower Darling!" I asked "What? not even a massage?" No darling!! my nails are too long! They break! 
Piss off! I thought but did'nt make an issue of it. Washed and got out. 
If anybody in the area wants to visit her, I don't know why, but she is there for another 10 days and then back in the CBD.

Not a problem nextlife. As a courtesy service I might direct you towards this link written in great detail... but absolutely NO use of a template and NO reference to a phone number either.

Thanks Zorro. The reason I mentioned it to you was because you started a  thread for a 'new' lady on this site. Being the only review , no one can contact her if contact details are not posted and the link is dead. 
The review you refer to - you are correct, no template, no phone number, but the review is of a lady from one of our advertisers with 366 review threads, and contact details for this business have been supplied previously. 
Just as an FYI,  that review does not count towards Silver membership for the author as it was not submitted on the template.

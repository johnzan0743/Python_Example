The pictures of that tasty ass on her web profile looked enticing and I texted to confirm they were real. It was a delayed process from that confirmation to getting a booking as initially texts were not returned until the next day and there may be third parties in play here, or maybe it is my network at fault. I almost gave up but we got that sorted eventually. Let me say right now any problems of that small frustration were removed once she walked through the door. She looks so sweet and innocent but when she flashes that evil smile you know instantly she is anything but that. We went straight to the bedroom and small chat followed whilst we casually undressed. Those breasts, while not large, are two rosebuds just sitting there with confidence and waiting to be plucked. She loves cock and her beautiful smile translates so smoothly from sweet innocent looking schoolgirl to sucking lollypop so slowly and sweetly devouring the moment, that it is an experience to behold. She gave the impression she would happily do that all day and enjoyed nothing more, but I wanted to go inside so I held on for as long as was humanly possible and she added a condom and jumped on top with relish. Very tight, very smooth ....fark... that was tooo fucking good. It was a fast game after that....soooo tight and so smoooooth!!! In between rounds, and this is why I would say there is really value for money here, she read me a passage from '120 days of sodom' that I happen to have next to the bed. Now she is originally from Oz, and I don't doubt she knows the wizard, but she has picked up an oh-so sexy British accent from her travels and damn that is worth hearing. The sound of that posh voice reading the marquis de sade and it's delicious content gave me some serious 18th century wood and we moved onto round two.

She jumps between Brisbane and Sydney but is sadly for us she is heading o/s for good next week so if you want to experience this girl you will really need to get in quick.

top shelf.....professional ....would highly recommend!

Great review, blackcoffee...the de Sade reading would have been a wickedly memorable moment.

And damn, those pix on PG are just sheer perfection...shame she's leaving the country.

Great review Blackcoffee. Pity she is leaving the country, should be a law against it. And yes extra points for the Marquis de Sade reading. Perhaps giving her a spanking while read it .................

Nice review... she sounds lovely... 24 hours for a txt response is pretty standard babe. Wouldn't worry about that, she is probably very busy being so well read and gorgeous!

Thanks Megan, I'm not worried about anything particularly, but my experience suggests that 24 hours response time is not standard at all. It can be frustrating. It is not professional. Heidi, for example, will respond within the hour and I can give you a list of others that are also blackberry savvy. That is just good business practice babe. Good business practices produce more profit in any business. Supply and demand suggest that if demand is too high then prices will increase. Demand will stabilize. Work less to make more! It's win/win babe! ..the capitalist freakin' dream...x

Ummm, depends. She could easily be a student. Or have a straight job which makes it difficult to respond within an hour. Or she could have been with family. Or even been on a long appointment. That's the problem with SMS people expect immediate responses and if you don't responses you're unprofessional (which is so far from the truth). 

I disagree, it is better to have high demand and competitive prices then to have a service price which fluctuates on demand because it doesn't foster trust in your service price to value ratio, but that's just me. 

 I am not sure what a reasonable 24 hour response time has to decreasing market value. in fact it kind of suggests she has ability to pick her clients more because she doesn't need to jump on inquires as soon as it comes in. 

You can be ipad, iphone, blackberry and everything else savvy it doesn't mean a woman will be available to answer your message immediately especially if you're a new client. I know for me if Ive got 10 emails, 7 from regs, I will answer regs first. On the scale of phone, email and sms, the sms has to be the least professional in any sector. So what is good for the goose is good for the gander! 

She couldn't be that unprofessional if you still saw her

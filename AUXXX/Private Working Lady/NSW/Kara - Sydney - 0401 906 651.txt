My regular and favorite girl for RnT establishments.   This review was from a session earlier in the year.

I got her phone number after seeing her for a while at Rn Places.  She works at Poplar St on Mondays and Hampden Rd Artarmon on Tuesdays but I wanted to see her on a different day.

She must be around 30 (always a bit hard to tell with Thai's) speaks very good English and has an absolutely awesome body.

I rang her and organised for her to meet me at my Darling Harbor Hotel at 5pm.   I picked up some champagne and nibbles for us to start with.   She kept on replying with text which I don't like as it leaves an evidence trail!   She was running late but let me know and we met closer to 6pm when I met her at the hotel taxy stop.   She looked awesome and dressed conservatively.

We go in to my room and she texts away - I guess just verifying her room number to a friend to monitor her.   She searched my room under the bed / cupboards, etc I assume in case she thinks there are others lurking around.

Eventually she seems relaxed and we share our nibbles and champagne while chatting away.   She removes some clothing so all I'm looking at is this gorgeous, slim Thai girl in a g-string and bra bending over my table and staring out the window to the view of Sydney CBD.   And there were even fireworks going off.   How I adored that arse!   If only she dd anal!!!!

Our chatting lasted a long time - at least an hour and we finished the Champagne.   Certainly a no rush service.   Eventually we adjourn to the bed and she grabs a dom and goes to work on my cock.   An awesome CBJ.   I lie on my back and think how good this is.

I keep imagining that view from behind so eventually I ask her to do a 180 and we go into a 69er.   Her pussy is freshly shaven and like her skin - all silky smooth.   She genuinely gets wet and really enjoys it.

I have to have her so she jumps on me and rides me cowboy.   Starting slowly her pace quickens and her thrusts deeper.   I feel like a king!   We change to Mish for a while before I settle on spooning her.   I love entering Kara from behind and viewing that arse.   I keep her legs tightly closed and it feels so tight fucking her like this.

I can't hold on any longer and blow in a huge orgasm.   I lay with her for a while then we both go for a quick shower to clean up.

By now its around 8pm and I'm hungry.   I offer to buy her dinner and we go to a restaurant together.   She has a steak and a beer (love chicks who drink beer) and then wants to go back for round 2 or even stay the night.    I have to decline her as I'm spent and have to get up at 4am for work.   For our time together she only asks for $150 and I give her an extra $20 for the cab.   Not bad value for about 3hrs of company.   Almost a GFE just wish she'd offer BBBJ!

Will see her again but maybe at the Rnt places.   Good value for money.

Thank you for your review of Kara Cubanrockclimber.

Awesome experience; what a lady.

We prefer that reviews are posted on the template since it cleanly separates the who/what/where from your report and may be a bit easier to read on mobile devices.

I love this gal but didn't realise she does outcalls. With that figure, I'm kind of shocked she eats steak and drinks beer. Where does it all go?
Of course, she's a little kooky but still lots of fun!

My experience/comments : 

Saw her ad on Cracker and her photos looked good but i never trust them. inher case i'm pretty sure they were her. She was European with good English and she offered greek at no extra charge which made my decision. She was in the CBD and it was easy to make the appointment and she was on time. She is blonde about 166cm with lovely C cups. She is quite pretty and greeted me in lacey underwear. after a shower ther was light kissing and she started jumping around the bed but i think she was just checking me out. i love DATY and she tasted quite good with a waxed pussy. her BBBJ was pretty ordinary bur she has beautiful skin and long blonde hair so it was nice just to watch her sucking. Protected sex was good in any position but not outstanding and i really wanted to get on with the Greek. she said she would try it which put me off as this usually means she isn't used to it and it may not happen. she lubed up and was very tight. she really tried hard and i got the head in but it was obvious that it hurt too much and that puts me right off. i decided to come then and she was relieved. she did try hard but it was not what i really wanted. we chatted for a while and she said she'd be better next time but i don't think i'll be back. YMMV as usual.

Well, the website they come from is studio osy.lv - photo studio - foto studija - which looks pretty professional, so I would say they are fake. Plus the first photo is of a different girl.

Sorry about that. in the flesh, she looks ok and reasonably close to the images.

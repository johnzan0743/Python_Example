 Any recommended WL's that do email bookings? No phone required?

Most only seem to take calls but for particular reasons I can't make calls for a while and I've always preferred email/text bookings anyway, but it's much rare. Does anyone know of any WL's who take email bookings that you'd also recommend? Nothing overly pricey either, $250 - $300 is my limit.

Just thought it'd be good to have a thread with some NSW girls who can be booked without phone access for everyones convenience.

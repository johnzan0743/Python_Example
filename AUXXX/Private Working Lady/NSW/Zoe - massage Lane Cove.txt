An hour for Auxxx members is $325; for non-Auxxx it’s $350. That is my new ‘Intimate Interlude’ service, where half the session is spent focused on the client, giving the wonderful massage, bodyslide, handjob & CBJ I’m well known (and well reviewed) for providing, and half the session is spent on my comfortable bed, exploring each other more intimately - full service with a twist  

It seems, from your reviews, that you’re used to providers who don’t have a dedicated massage or working space, who don’t provide all the little touches (a lovely hot shower, heated towels, privacy, punctuality) so I can perhaps understand why you think $350 is a lot for an hour of massage, mutual oral, kissing, & essentially a GFE. Then again, this review is in the massage section, not PWL. I’ve requested it be moved to under my thread for consistency. 

May you have many sensual sessions in 2018 xo

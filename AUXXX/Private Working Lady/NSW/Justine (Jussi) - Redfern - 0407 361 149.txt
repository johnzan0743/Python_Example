Hours of Business : Advertises 7 days a week, so I guess send her a message and she will get back to you. She got back to me quite quickly, that was during the day on a workday.

Rates : 
30 mins $150
60 mins $250
overnight $1800 8pm to 8am
Extras
COF $50
CIM $50

Age : 35 but more like 45

Size/shape : Round, curvy, about a size 12-14 if I'm honest. Nice set of big titties if that's your thing 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Caucasian

Services Provided : BBBJ, GFE, PSE, party

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Very friendly, quite chatty, she claimed to give the best head, but I thought it was a bit too eager and rough, to the point where I had to tell her to be gentle. Then she went on top for a bit, she was very enthusiastic, so point for that. It was quite a hot day, within about 5 minutes she was covered in sweat, some people might like that but it wasn't a huge turn on for me, maybe she's been partying...Then we went into doggy style and fucked her for a bit in that position with the usual moaning etc. Finally I took the condom off and let her suck for a bit more, I asked if I could CIM but she said that was extra so I elected to cum on her tits. We chatted for a bit afterwards, I asked her about party options, she said she's open to them and is happy to do a longer booking for a flat hourly rate of $200. Overall not a bad experience for someone close to the city and wanting to pay less than the usual $200-$250 per half hour rate.

This girl is quite hot in person. Nice fit bod.The photos on the PG ad look like they are of three different people though and she is not that toned. Gives a reasonable bbbj but makes a fuss about the time you don't want to be hearing words over the loud gurrgling sounds......jesus just move your head if that's such an issue.......the phone always rings in the middle of dinner.....a more experienced WL can do the deed without the commentary or the fuss and I think at this price that is just not acceptable......anyway we move to cowgirl and not that long into it she gets tired and is not shy in sharing that fact with me.......shit! do I care??? ....hit the gym girl...work those thighs.......feel that burn....if I wanted an amatuer effort I'd go to a bar....anyway so then we move to doggy and she makes the comment " you must be done soon"  or something similar....now I don't kid myself that I have abnormal stamina or anything of the sort and this was all in a period of less an hour so we are not talking marathon struggle, cruel or unusual punishment here.....anyway I'm not adding the link or prices locations or any info because I won't go back and don't expect anyone else should bother either....price does not match service in this case. Not to say others may have had better experiences here. 3/10 an extra point because she didn't yawn!

Sorry to hear that BC.. but for argument sakes.. we do need and it would be appreciated that you provide the "finer" details such as link and prices etc as it is still used as a data base and review service and it would be used as a reference..

All is fair in this regard.. a review without details is really pointless..

not really AB....since the invention of google everything is only a click away after all...a name is as good as a web address....and I did mention PG and I am assuming we all know that is Private Girls....and I notice also that you generally add those details that have been omitted accidentally from other posts... so feel free to do likewise in this case when the action was definitely with a point and to emphasize that point clearly by the action of omission as some small compensation for the lack of satisfying emission.....can't stop you from adding the details you see fit to add, however superfluous I might consider them to be in a world were google is god....

BC, 

Yes and no.. 

Yes, I agree with you in that Google is your best friend.. and all manner of information is available..

Yes, I agree with in that you have mentioned PG, meaning Private Girls.. but some also do not "punt" and review at that level so it would be appreciated in pointing it out.. Sometimes.. providing all the information does help.. "think" of it as reviewing and punting guide for newbies?.. I guess what I am saying is that dont assume.. IMHO.. sometimes all info does help..

In regards to "us" filling in the details, well again it is to aid and provide others with the missing info that the "reviewer" has left out.. sometimes they only post once to get access and we never hear from them again.. "lurkers" we like to call them.. what one gives also enable you to take away.. the more you give the more you get out.. it works both ways.. it encompasses what forums are all about.. I am sure you would "agree" with me in that regard..

As mentioned.. I empathize with you on your experience and guess it was to provide a insight and time spent and to make a statement and point.. I understand.. but for the greater forum and knowledge.. all "details" no matter big, small or irrelevant helps others.. it sometime maybe a case of YMMV.. what doesnt work/connect with one might be bliss and the best time spent.. we have all experienced this..

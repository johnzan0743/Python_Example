My 2nd Review - an Ugly Girl from Cracker

Evening all,,

My second review gets kicked in the balls from my first review but I thought I should post it so as to prevent anyone making the same mistakes I've made recently..

OK,, so we all know that 99% of adds on Cracker where the photo looks professional or staged or too good to be true,, is indeed too good to be true. Lets me honest, the city is not full of amazing looking Asians gagging for a mouthful of cock inbetween their modeling careers and PhD's in economic studies. Now dont get me wrong, ,there are lots of amazing 'real' girls on Cracker and I've met some of the best girls I've been with there,,, but you have to thrawl thru the Asian 'Alice in Wonderland' first.

The problem of course is that sensible thinking is quickly replaced by your Knobb telling you that no,, she is real,, you'll be the first and she'll love you for ever more and when she is the head of risk management at ABN Amro, she'll remember you and make you her play-thing and pay you instead of you paying her.... yes... we've all done it,, be honest with youselves...

With this 'Can-Do' attititude, I recently found myself wandering up the arse-end of George Street looking for an address to see a girl who advertises as 'Lilly' on Cracker.

Now, lets pause for a moment and reflect on Lilly. Her advertisement tells me she is just arrived up from Melbourne and doesn't know many people ( Great - I love making new friends and can soon add her to my LinkedIn account ), She's looking for a few select gentlemen ( I'm a gentleman ), She offers a 'No Rush' service ( nice seeing as I will more then likely have blown my load in the first 15 minutes of our booking, I can spend the rest of the time chatting about the eat-scene of Melbourne and why they think they are better then us ) and finally,, the deal closer for me,, she refers to the GFC and how its economic impact on Australia has forced her to drop her rates to $250, ( suiting a cheap bastard like me while also demonstrating how I will soon be on 'easy street' and she will soon pick up a job in ABN Amro or Deutsche Bank and I can be her bitch for a while ).

Finally,, and the reason I'm skipping work and about to make an arsehole of myself,, her photo's show this dream of a girl, great body, tanned, tight, sweet looking,,, and off I go, hard-on in my pants up the arse end of George Street...

So,, what opened the door for me - well lets just say that Lilly obviously got a call from a head-hunter about a new opening at BT Financial Services after she took my booking. Panicing as she would have realised that cancelling my booking to attend her interview would have endangered our potential friendship and with a lack of friends in Sydney, and even less who can appriciate Melbourne like I do, she decided that she should leave her smelly, fat, tatoo ridden, hairly, mildy mentally challenged house-keeper in charge.

Now, english,,, or for that matter any other language,, was not her first language and given the direction her teeth were facing in her mouth, I dont suppose that would have made any difference as it would have been physcially impossible for her to talk much anyway. I asked her to fetch Lilly away from her studies and 'announce me', as one would do when meeting a new friend. Unfortunetly the house-keeper, misunderstanding me, may have heard something like "Hello, I'm from Immigration and we dont let ugly little trolls like you in here legally and I'll have you being the pounded in the arse-end of Villawood unless you get naked now'

I wish in hindsight I brought a business card or something that could have shown that I was not the Law,, becuase what followed was come close to turning me gay. She looked like that funny hairly thing in Star Wars and I'm fairly sure had taped a badly wrapped Kabab to the area where she should have had a vagina. I hammered away, pushing back the tears and wondering if there was any clorine left in the pool house at home. "Christ, if Lilly walked in on us now, I'm fucked', I thought. Anyway, 19 seconds later I urupted, partly in fear and partly becuase the brissles on her,, I dont know what to call it,,, thing,, felt like I was been wanked off my 18 seperate Sherpa's,, but once finished I felt it best not to hang around in case she got emotionally attached and got out of there asap. Leaving a 'Sorry I missed you' card for Lilly, I ran slap into a nice Indian man who may have come for a taxi booking,, I'm not sure,, but that certainly put it in the difficult position of never accepting an invite to a cocktail evening at Lilly's place in case I bump into her again.

As a side note, I dont think Lilly got the job at BT Financial Services as she is still advertising on Cracker.. But all good things come to those who wait.....

I love kebabs - she could be perfect. Does she have a flat head so I can rest my beer?

here is the link and also copied and pasted the details or for that matter others who wish to take the plunge..

http://cracker.com.au/sydney-inner-s...urn=1&pageno=4

[COLOR="blue"]My name is Lilly and I am new to Sydney. Lived in Melbourne for the last year and I really don't know much about Sydney except the guys here know how to have fun. If you have seen me in Melbourne I would love to see you again in Sydney and if I haven't seen you this is a new opportunity for me to meet someone nice and that can show me something new. 

About myself: I'm 5'6", I have long silky hair with soft, tanned and toned skin. I am down to earth and I like to have lots of fun. I am very sensual and love to give and receive pleasure. 

I pride myself on building lasting friendships with only a few select gentlemen. However, when we do meet, I like to offer no rush sessions and take my time in providing you with the ultimate experience. 

Since the GFC the economy is not as good as it used to be. So I have adjusted my price to today's standards. My rate is $250 per hour, $200 for half hour and if longer I offer a good discount. I also love to party and give good discount for those part guys out there. 

The photos are of me a few months ago and they are genuine. If you are and Escort agentÂ…. Please don't call me. I'm not interested. 

Love Lilly[/COLOR]

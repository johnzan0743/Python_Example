My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Making contact with Amanda was easy, I sent a text and she responded soon. We agreed various extras as offered in her ad for a total of 300.

She sent me an address in a dodgy part of Redfern. When I turned up though the address provided didn't exist and I had to call her. Turns out she was across the street, presumably wanted to check me out before giving the full address. She is in what looks like an estate, old and run down.

She meets me at the door and that's where it took a turn for the worse. She isn't the girl in the ad. Not unattractive, but not the girl in the pics. She is larger, with dyed blond hair. And I could smell her pussy, it had that stale smell of old sex and not having been cleaned up. Her apartment is disgusting and smelly with cats everywhere. We go to the bedroom and she takes the money and undresses, partially, basically letting her boobs flop out and taking off her undies. She put a dom on. I reminded her of her extras, she replied that she never does that. Fuck I think, I paid for that. A desultory be and she lies down for sex. She is dry, and no lube. We screw for a while, not long, and she says something about time being up. Fuck it I thought and got up and left. She didn't seem either surprised or concerned, and said something about how she'd make it up next time.

I left, 300 poorer and unsatisfied.

You have been warned fellas

 Ava - Chippendale - 0408 696 064
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Ava

Establishment : Independent

Date of Visit : 2/04/2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0408696064. near UTS and Central park. http://sydney.cracker.com.au/FemaleE...00646/41499763

Hours of Business : 10:00 am till 12:00pm

Rates : 250$ (extra service 50$ each) --CIF, COF, BBBJ, OWO,ALL NATURAL, CIP

Age : around 35 to 40 (sends fake pictures of a 21 year old blonde thin asian girl)

Size/shape : Mature overweight lady with 36C boobs. 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Says Korean but I believe sounds Chinese.

Services Provided : BBBJ for 50$, some Natural all for VIP 750$ package, FS, covered service in 250$, sSquirting for 50$ (which is fake)

Value for money/recommend? : Not at all...(run!)

My experience/comments : So I contacted this lady who lives nearby UTS. She sent me her rates which sounded real confusing (700 for all natural or 800 with massage etc.). I chose the 250$ package with two side options of squirting and natural oral for another 50$. so 350$ in total. When I arrived to her studio, the women was much older Asian and not as beautiful. She had those artificial braces on her teeth to look younger. Horny as I was, I should have turned back, but I didn't. We got to business and she started giving me the natural oral. With braces on, it felt awful!...I wanted to get over it asap. As I had requested earlier for her to wear shorts or trim her pubes, she also had lied to that. The Pubes were a jungle.She didn't let me do DATY and asked for extra 50$ for it. The sex was rushed and I tried her in missionary and doggie positions. She also had some really big blobs of sucking cup massage bruise marks on her back...(that was another clue to her lying about being Korean..most Chinese do this type of massage). Her accent was definitely Chinese.

When I finally asked her about the 'squirting experience',which I had paid 50$, she casually replied 'Honey I squirted...I squirted inside'. I didn't want to engage in a brawl over there to return my money back and just got up and showered with a disgust. She kept on repeating 'Honey, when you come back I give you squirting'. Yeah right!

This was easily the most disappointing and fraudulent experience with an Asian 'woman' in Sydney!


Cons: fake picture, fake profile, doesn't deliver on services




Piece of Advice to all fellows here: Most of the Asian places around Sydney Chippendale or Redfern areas have plenty of fake Asian (especially) profiles trying to fleece foreign students or tourists. Be aware of this and ask the escort to produce selfies with your name on it in pics before going.

At those rates she doesn't need to stitch up too many punters each day - someone I wonder who the smartest on win the room is!
I get so pissed off with myself when it's happened to me - There are better out there vamp!

Compare this to somewhere like 64 Alexander or 533 Willoughby where you can find gems for $150 an hour.
I'd be steering you to shop like that for in improved performance and better value for money.

Good review though - in it's honesty

thanks. Yeah I felt really ripped off from that old hag. I sense in Australia they really take you a ride. Especially the Asians..compared to lets say in Dubai. There even the hottest and youngest Japanese women lower their prices a LOT, and let you do everything all inclusive * since their preference usually is at the bottom*. Here they are all the rage..so supply and demand.

Given the merchandise was not what was advertised you should have walked in the first place.

You are right, but having the little brain continuously whispering for one...and the other of me having a somewhat gentleman tendency in these affairs (which have let me down a couple of times)

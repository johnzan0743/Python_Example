Saw this ad and was hooked immediately:
 
Hi Boys I'm Diamond

My friends say I'm bootylicious!

I am 19yrs old and Brazilian heritage. Long black hair, full lips " on  my face hahaha" I have a D cup bust and a booty to die for.
I have not been in the industry for very long but absolutely love it. I  provide a girlfriend experience and lots and lots of extras.

Call me for the ultimate experience 0431 559 869

I will be available Friday and Saturday from 8pm to 6am.

In call $350 and Out call $400 

Credit cards and EFT available.                     

               Poster's age: 19

Txted on Thursday to find out she available and in the CBD on Friday, but after calling during Friday during the day she was booked out for the night. Photos are spectacular, my type of girl, young, curvy and hot, and the mobile phone pics suggest genuine rather than the usual professionally taken fakes that litter this industry. The only concern I had was after speaking to her she sounded a lot older than 19, (I would've guessed 30's by the maturity in her voice) so wondered if this really is her.
Anyone had a go, or willing to take one for the team? I will try again when I have the chance but my Friday window of opportunity has passed....

Agencies can add some value (or at least in other businesses) by selecting people that are either more talented or more suitable, providing payroll management, payment processing (as you point out), and the morale boost of working with those that are familiar with the industry.

The agencies existence depends on the quality of the product.

Agree with you generally about agencies but don't be in a hurry to conclude they are purely parasitic.

The email of this one is www . eveescorts6969@ gmail.com but they don't seem to have a like named web page, nor
does a search for Eve Escorts Sydney find anything (there is an Eve Escorts in London ...)

When I spoke to her she said "I'm" busy tonight, so assumed it was her I was speaking to and she asked me to call her friend Kimmy who works in the same apartment. But I was specifically after her since the girl in that photo is exactly what I'm after, not her friend.

As for agencies, they are a necessary evil in all walks of life. Car agents, recruitment, real estate etc. There is value is having a third party match buyers with sellers and rightfully take a commission for their effort (and no I'm not an agent of any description, but do use their services because I don't like doing it myself.

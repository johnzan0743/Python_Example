My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Now its the duty of us all to report the bad, misleading and the good, of course the following is only my experience, as ever YMMV. Easy booking free immediately, just address given, sounded like a Massamna reeling me in, so went with an open mind. On arrival again  given massaman style directions the room was actually one of those holiday apartments. Sent straight into room, girl reappeared naked and took my money, I tried the hello, polite hug told you lie down, humm alarm bells but had already handed over the cash. Laid down and she started tugging immediately with no style, I played with the rack for amusement and kill some time, I tried the little kiss thing to get some feeling going. A strange conversation then took place, apparently she would kiss me next time and I should take her out, yeah right! LMFAO. She gave a little hoover CBJ, I even went to mish and pounded for a bit but the whole experience was cold. Took the dom off and succumbed to some rough HJ while playing with the false cannonballs to get me over the line so I could leave, left feeling dirty and a little deflated. Good news the tennis was on and I only missed a set including travel time. Fellas dont bother, download redtube and wank if this is all you can find. Pics are real but dont be tempted.

From the photo supplied she looks very similar to the Indian who was offering services out of a unit at Caringbah. As the reviews confirmed, she also offered some very bad services. Maybe she has moved to the country?

To fartichoke, yes that's the one. Visited her once and that was enough for me. She has not been advertising locally of late thus assume she must have moved on.

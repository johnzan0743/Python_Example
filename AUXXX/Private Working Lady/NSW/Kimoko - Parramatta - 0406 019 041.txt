My experience/comments : Probably the only negative experience I've had to date. Was given directions and upon arriving had to ink out the finer details. At the very of find the right room I was pleasantly surprised to see a very attractive lady. She confirmed what I wanted then tried to sell me on extras for more cash and trying to barter ** red flag 1**. Start stripped down only for her to start going through my clothes **red flag 2**. She smiles then moves my clothes to another random spot (whatever) and I finally lay down on the bed.

30 seconds in and she starts caressing me when suddenly a door opens a flash of light. "Mamasan" comes out of bathroom and starts talking asking if I want extra girl. ** red flag 3**. What the ****. Had I not already paid I'd be bailing and jumping out the balcony parkour style. Mamasan isn't as pretty as the "Japanese" but she'd probably be a better root. 

My girl had sore wrists from "massage", was very tired and unenthusiastic and said I was "too big". I'm very respectful so took it slow and tried to just focus on what other positive aspect I could find. In the end it was very mechanical, she seemed uninterested and it felt more plain than a glass of water. Service was rushed, shower didn't even work (more a statement about the motel).

Pros: She's attractive despite the amount of makeup caked on her face.
Cons: Pretty much everything, service was rushed, poor value, unenthusiastic and very mechanical.

I have to be honest but, this ones a dud.

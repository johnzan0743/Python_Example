There has been an African MIX P.W.L. working in serviced apartments in the Lidcombe to Parramatta area who sounds interesting, that the SeaRay was planning to visit today, but when she wasn't picking up her phone even through she advertised in BackPage / Cracker to say she was working on Sunday, when there was no response by the time I got to Bunning's @ Rydalmere, I spent the $150 for 45 minutes and $200 P/H on a new Makita Drill

Her first ad as seen on cracker was rather curious as it mentioned that she has done everything. So after pondering for some time, I rang her to learn more about her services back in May, where I learned that "everything" did include gfe and pse services such as rimming, bbbj, cim and greek which came in at an extra $50. I am not sure if the definition of everything included brown and gold showers but as I am rather repulsed by them, I did not ask about them. Within half an hour of my enquity she rang back asking if it I was going to show up to a 7pm appointment. After telling her that I was enqiring only, she checked her facts and appologised via SMS after another half hour later. 
Despite her error, I decided to make an appointment with her on the 19th of June. She gave me the name of the venue in Kings Cross as well as confirmed the 2pm time. Unfortunately, when I arrived at the venue; I waited 15 minutes only to be told that she messed up, telling me that she forgot and said that I had to wait an hour or two  to reschedule an appointment. Given my tight schedule and the need to commute to and from home via public transport (as I live outside of greater Sydney), I declined her offer but she SMSed and rand to appologise to me explaining that she used her phone as a diary and forgot to set an alarm to notify her of our appointment. She said that "I (Sassy) promise I will make it up to you". I told her if she can compensate me with $120 for 1 hour then I will say yes. She accepted and as such made an appointment for a hotel in oxford street on the 30th June. 
i made my way up getting off at the museum and gradually making my way to the hotel. After waiting anxiously outside for fear of being stood up again, she opened the door to me and let me up to the hotel room where again she appologised to me and formally introduced each other. She told me what happened and confirmed the "compensation" that I would receive (1 hour @ $120 with greek at $50 extra OR $200 for 2 hours!).I even told her of my surprise that her services included everything and thus made the risky decision to ask her about bareback whick I was anticipating a no, surprisingly she said yes on the provisio that I am clean. So after undressing and having my cock inspected, she agreed and thus began our experience. 
She started by probing me of myself which I declared of my mental illness (mild autism), which she was neutral with and said that I was doing well to manage it. She asked me of what I wanted to do. I told her and she was ok. We then moved to kissing which involved a lot of tongue which I was not too keen on but played along nonetheless. She then gave me a bbbj which was decent but made all the more better with spitting on the cock as well as a deepthroat or two and after that we moved onto vaginal penetration where she fully removed her clothes and was ridden by her. Originally she was on top but then swapped positions for the doggy. Bizarelly, I would take a while to cum but somehow I managed to cid after 10 minutes! In shock, I asked if I could continue which she agree to, so as we altered positions with her on the top, then the bottom, to the side and back to the top, I came again after 5 minutes! But at least I got to witness a cream pie which was rather interesting. She was rather sympathetic and as my cock was still rock hard, we were allowed to continue. It was great because not only did we continue but her enthusiasm and enjoyment was enforced by her moans of pleasure and the need for me to keep giving it to her. At certain intervals we stopped so we can "recharge" ie take 5 minutes for water break. Upon resumption, we continued doing the same thing and received more sloppy bbbj. Towards our final attempt, she allowed me to engage in greek where I did apply the condom and had my cock guided into her anus for some action. As it was my first time giving greek, I was expecting a tight anus but was a bit dissapointed that it was not as tight as I expected. I still found the experience rather fascinating and glad to have developed myself sexually and that she liked it. 
After a bit more of the vaginal and bbj, she decided to stop after 1.5 hours and as such we continued to talk. She told me more about her work as a nurse and as a WL as well the unsual experiences it entails: an evil punter who may be the same person who harassed aprilrose85, another punter who has an unsual fantasy request and a punter who was under police surveillance. She even asked me why I punted as well as my observations and personal opinions on porn and punting. It was through this that I revealed my poor experiences with an indian WL to whom she offered to and "defend me" by talking directly to her and to treat her punters with respect. I thanked her profusely for the services received as well as her selfless actions and promptly paid her before leaving.
The experience was definitely a great one and very memorable as I got to explore myself more sexually and grow immensely. She needs to be more organised in the future but I would love to see her in the future.

Thanks for the review, when I saw the original Cracker ad I took her to be a Trannie  but obviously not. Reading your review I was interested in meeting up with her until I got to the part of your review when it became clear that bareback was indeed the full enchilada...with creampie !  
No thanks for me, I'll be giving this one a wide berth.

I did see this lady recently. I just didn't click with her from the moment I saw her. I was horny and went ahead with the deed but it wasn't to my liking. She obviously did everything but I was happy to unload and get out. I made sure I was covered during sex and came in her mouth. She may suit some but I won't be back.

Thanks for the review. It seems you two were able to connect and open up a bit. I frequent Asians so anything resembling a deep chat is usually off the cards...

Thanks SeaRay. Her Cracker ads come up in the search but seems to have been removed from the Cracker database, although I was still able to view one through Google caches. Googling sassydarlominx comes up with her Youtube profile. lol.

The OP has a warm review of her whilst following reviews on this thread has been quite negative. Maybe someone who has tried her can give their elaborated opinion?

Boys,

Threats of any kind are not tolerated here.

I understand that we are all big bronzed ANZAC's, but......we do not tolerate stupid shit here.

It is actually against the law to use the internet to convey threats and if she is threatening members here, coherent or not it will not be tolerated.

I will leave this in your hands, but if you want the threats to stop, you can privately block her posts and PM's, or escalate the issue to a Mod and we will derail her PM'ing tramcar.

Realise though that if you complain to us we will need to investigate and will require evidence to do anything.

Cheers

For me it was no biggie, her threats were wildly off the mark and she clearly had the wrong person but nonetheless they persisted threatened getting her lawyer on to me etc etc. 
PA I think copped it worse than me and he was in the firing line, I sent a copy of her PM's to me on to him if he wanted to pursue it.

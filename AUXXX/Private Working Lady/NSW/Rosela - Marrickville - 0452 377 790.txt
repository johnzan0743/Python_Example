My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

I had been browsing scarlet blue for a while as it had been a while since I had any action and I was looking for quality and they have a filter to search by escort rates, as I was looking to spend a max of $400 for an hour, which is not easy on this site but there are a few options.

I had booked to see Alice Wells as I love curvy girls and had always wanted to make love to an Irish lass. Alas it was not to be as something came up and she had to cancel. Thus it was time for plan B (always have a plan B and maybe a C too) which was Rosela.

I texted her just before 12pm and she responded in only about a minute to advise she was in Marrickville and if that would work for me. I asked for her nearest station, which was Petersham and approx. 5min drive to her place so I booked a 1 hr gfe session for 1:30pm and she advised the rate would be $400.

There was supposed to be a taxi rank at the station but unfortunately no taxis in site so I called premiere cabs. After chasing them up and waiting for about 15min it was obvious it wasn't going to show. Fortunately she was able to get an uber for me and I texted her at 1:42pm to let her know I was in the car.

I arrived at her apartment door around 1:50pm and was greeted by a very pretty lady, her pictures def don't do her justice as her face looks a bit masculine in them but in reality she looks very feminine and she has a very soft, girly voice.

I was worried that I arrived 20min late and wanted to see whether our session could still go the hour however she assured me it was fine as I was her only client for the day. Paid her the $400 for an hour after explaining that I was after a sensual gfe with plenty of intimacy and foreplay inc oral on her in sensual face sitting position and she confirmed she could include the bbbj as well, which was great as I'd never experienced that before.

She wanted to have a bit of a get to know you chat before I headed to the shower which was something I hadn't had before but was a nice touch.

After the shower I returned to her bedroom and she closed the door softly behind me, which got me really excited, embraced me and started kissing me passionately. There was a mirror and we stood in front of that, me standing behind her as I kissed her neck and caressed every inch of her body and we slowly grinded as well.

Eventfully we made our way to the bed were we spooned and kissed some more. I proceeded to kiss her all over and gently rubbed her pussy through her panties. She gradually shed her bra and panties and I asked her if she was ready for the ultimate pleasure, face sitting, to which she  replied with an enthusiastic yes!

This would be only the 2nd time I experienced it but I enjoyed it so much the first time I had to try it again. She sat facing me with her pussy right up in my face and supported herself by grabbing onto the bedhead. I proceeded to lick and suck her for what seemed quite some time, she moaned softly and every now and then I could feel her body shuddering as she came. After a while my jaws were getting quite sore but did my best to ignore the pain and focus on pleasuring her. I didn't want to stop until she had enough and eventually she stopped and it was time to return the favour.

I still had my boxer shorts on at this point as I wanted her to tease me through them as I love that sort of thing, and tease me she did, using her lips and tongue to do so! By this point I was rock hard and was worried my boner going to break a hole through them! Fortunately that didn't occur as she soon set it free and proceeded to kiss, lick and suck on my balls and cock. Her bbbj was ok but I was hoping for a bit more tbh, it felt a bit toothy and perhaps I would have enjoyed it better with a condom but at least I got to experience one I guess.

It was time for some love making and she proceeded to ride me softly in cowgirl with the pace gradually increasing. She has natural dd's and I certainly enjoyed the view of them bouncing up and down!

She's not an athletic girl and soon tired so I asked if she liked doggie which of course she did. Before I go in I take some time to kiss her body, thighs and ass cheeks and then I entered. She has a nice big round ass so the view was extremely stimulating for me and before I know it I've filled my condom while still inside her and it felt good!

You're probably wondering why the hell I put no for value for money after what I've written so far. Well up until this point it was great, she gave me everything I wanted in the session and provided great companionship. Unfortunately that quickly changed after she cleaned me up...

She checked her phone and was surprised to see the session went about 30 min over. I'm thinking, great, she's not a clock watcher but being the gentleman that I am, asked how much I owe her, thinking that she would wouldn't worry about it given that she never gave me any warning either before or during the session that she would charge extra if it went over but would not give me any warning during session that this was occurring. I don't wear a watch during sessions as I want my focus to be 100% on the lady and surely it is not the clients responsibility to check the time, right!

Anyway to my surprise she says it will be $150 (which just happened to add up to $550, hmm...) She mentioned something about me taking a long time with the shower, though I would have thought the time should have started from when I finished the shower and returned to the bedroom! Being on a high and needing her to arrange an uber to get me back to the station, I wasn't going to argue and I paid her the $150.

She texted me at 3:25pm when I was in the uber to say it was lovely to meet me and travel safe, so given it was about 1:50pm when I first arrived at her door it was probably only about 20min over but that's besides the point anyway...

So there you have it, that's why I said no as for me $550 for an hour is not value for money. I don't earn much and work hard for my money and never go away on holidays so to have to cough up an extra $150 was a lot of money for me but it's not just about the money, it's the principle too as I believe she should not have charged me without giving me a warning that we were going to go over the time. I put the asterisk because some people may have still found that rate value for money with the bbbj but for me it wasn't sorry.

This was the first time in 11 years of punting that I had been charged extra without  warning and am wondering if this has happened to anyone else before? Am I right to be upset with how it ended? Would love to hear your thoughts

After looking at her photos, all I can say is, thank you for taking one for the team. That's way too much to pay

At the end, when you were about to leave, I would have said: "Nice meeting you, all the best for your future endeavours" or words to that effect suggesting that you will never see her again. Then, maybe she would get the message about customer satisfaction.

You volunteered to pay the money and then complain when you paid? How is it her fault? f you boss voluntarily offered to pay overtime would you refuse it? I always look at the clock to know how much time is left to pace myself. If I know I will come early then I do so and then go for a second round, admittedly not often.

I somewhat agree with you. It's 100% on the lady to monitor time and let you know when its over. If she loses track of time, your gain and her loss.

If you reframe it then one could say she was having such a good time that she let time past. 

Wouldn't a PWL actually set her timer as well? Unless she has some enforcer hidden inside a closet then she wouldn't be able to enforce the extra fee so I'd say she took the OP at face value because he volunteered to pay. Moral of the story, don't volunteer to do something if you have no intention of going to go through with it and are simply virtue signalling.

Also OP if 150 is a lot of money let alone spending 400 maybe should ask us for some budget punting advice.

He goofed it up with an unlucky comment, but I can see why he's annoyed. With punting, there's an illusion of attraction, it's part of the act. Once that illusion gets abruptly broken you naturally feel bad.

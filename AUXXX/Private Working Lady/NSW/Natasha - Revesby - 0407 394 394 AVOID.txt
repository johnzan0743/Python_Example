My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)
So I'd see this ad a bit for Natasha. Home from work early on a Monday arvo, send her a text and she says to come round. It's only a 15 min drive, so I head over. It's a townhouse/unit on a mainish road, it's easy to get lost in the complex though. Her unit is the one with all the junk and clutter out front. She calls me and guides me in to her place (I actually parked directly out the front of her spot)...

Now this is where it goes bad. There are CCTV cameras everywhere. Multiple ones out the front, multiple once you enter. I walked in and there are 2 flatscreens with mutiple cameras showing. I'd say there is 8 in total. Next, there are cats. Multiple. Everywhere. Gotta be at least 5. The place absolutely fkn stinks like cat piss, kitty litter and crystal meth. It's beyond disgusting. I ask her about the smell and she says it's gyprock that been cut for renovations... You 100% need a gas mask in this place. After about 30 seconds I'm having a coughing fit, I can feel the odour (and god knows what chemicals) in my throat. My eyes are watering. She offers me a glass of water, but I'm not game enough to test it. 

She asks me how long I want (I'd agreed to an hour). I say sorry, I've just got a text from my work and I need to go in, it's an emergency. She drops her knickers and says she can do 15 for $100, but won't get her tits out as she just had them done. I say sorry, I need to run. Outside, in the car and I'm doing 90kmh down the road with the window open, mouth out the window like a dog, trying to get rid of the taste. Pull into a servo, down a gatorade and a red bull (I hate gatorade and red bull) and smash a cherry ripe (hate those too) and a pack of extra. I'm still coughing and still can't get the taste out of my mouth 12 hours later. 

Now - she's actually a nice woman. Much older than stated, but has a banging body. I don't think she was affected by drugs at all, but I could def pick up crystal meth (old roomies use to smoke it, so I can recognise the scent) and the cats, kitty litter and cameras are a major fucking hazard. 

In 10 years of punting, this is by far the worst experience I've had. There's about 3 mins worth of footage from multiple angles of me at this place, not that I think she would use it - I have a feeling there's probably drug dealing going on from the location. Fellas, for the love of god, stay away.

If there are CCTV and the smell of chemicals around maybe they are doing more than just riding the white pony and some dealing.

That’s what I thought when I read the post.  Gyprock doesn’t smell when cut, if that’s the case she must be permanently strung out.

There is being caught and then being caught. Imagine having to explain to your partner how that despite being caught up in a police raid and that the good news is you were only there to fuck a hooker and not involved in the manufacture and trafficking of commercial quantities of ice.

maybe there should be a stickied thread called places to avoid for our reference.

Thank you very much for this post, you've probably saved a number of guys from experiencing that awful situation.

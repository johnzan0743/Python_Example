My experience/comments : 

Found Victoria ad in Crockor, setup a time after exchanged a few texts. Comm was very easy and prompt.
On arrival was greeted by an average blonde lady in her late 30s or early 40s. It was hot sunday so she was only wearing a top and g-string, revealing a nice body for her age. Sorted the business out and jump to the shower. She offered something to drink so just asked for cold water. On the bed I tried to kiss but it was a no-no. She asked if I wanted a massage to start but told her I rather prefer to fuck LOL! She asked if I prefer natural or covered bj which I opted for the first option. Her BJ was quite good. Asked for sex, she dom up and jump on top. CG was nice so I could my hands on her tits which are nice to touch. We then fucked in various positions, but was in doggie where I sensed a strong fishy smell coming out of her pussy... This was quite off putting so changed to missy, pumped hard and release the load in the bag.

After finished tried to have some conversation but she cut me out as she had another booking. Fair enough, had my shower and off I went.

VFM? WIR? It was ok punt but don't think I would return. She wasn't rude at any point but feel lack of connection for someone who claims providing passionate service.

Did you have fishfingers afterwards for a snack?

It is a sign of an STD present or a simple lack of PH balance in her vag. Trichomoniasis is the most common STD that causes a fishy odour. It is easy to treat but also requires active rest aside from the treatment.
Bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection candidiasis can also cause a fishy odour.

If I ever detect a fishy smell I find a way to bring it to the attention of the WL.
Often it happens due to being overclean and getting washes up into the vag and changing the PH balance which in turn is virtually undetectable for the WL but clearly offputting for the punter.

It can also be a sign of poor hygiene or a used tampon remaining in situ or a number of other causes including poor diet and medication regimes.

It rarely is a sign of uncleanliness so if she appears to be clean and smell fresh in other areas then you may assume she likely has no clue as to how to achieve a balanced PH.

Some are simply not suited to the game. Suggest anyone encountering an odour that is offputting simply terminate the session explain to the worker she need to have an STD check and she should cancel any appointments for the day and attend to the issue asap.
Condoms only protect to a certain degree and are not the panacea that some promote them to be.

Don't let it worry you though you have an equal chance of being hit by a car exiting the venue whilst smelling your fishy fingers...so look left and right before crossing the road..

I reckon you are right mate, but just think it is not easy to tell a WL about her body odour or even recommend to get a STD check without offending LOL!

Terminate the session? Humm this is again another tough call to make, specially when was close to finish.
I understand your points and you seem to be very knowledgeable on this matter but still dunno how to approach in such sensitive topic to a lady who I met in the very first time.

Also, I don't want to jump into conclusions about the health condition of this lady here, as it's a very sensitive topic and a false rumour can ruin people's lives.

For now let me just say that I experienced an unpleasant odour but could be just a bad day.

I guess the question posed Hulk would be to ask yourself would you return to see a working lady again for a repeat visit if you encountered this smell or stench at your first meeting.

In other words would you give someone the benefit of the doubt and return?

If you answered probably not cause you have plenty of others you are yet to see then perhaps you could simply bring up the subject before you leave. After all chances are she would not know she has the stench as she has clearly no idea that it is offensive as she can't smell it. That or she is clueless.

I think it is probably one of the trickier situations that one might find themselves in.

Clearly reviewing and making it clear on the site might well cause her a loss of potential clients.
But you have done the right thing absolutely.

Smell is one of our best senses to prevent us fro becoming ill or it can be a sign suggesting to steer clear.

So perhaps she should be informed as to what is going on. If it is simply a matter of PH balance or indeed an STD then she shouldn't take it personally it is part of routine maintenance and upkeep of her work tools and equipment.

But how to broach the subject is the question posing the problem...

Hey Guys

Victoria has been around for a long time and has had many reviews on this site under different phone numbers, I have always been a little wary as she has advertised for years with no pics which rings warning bells for me.

Thanks mate but based on the description I don't think is the same WL. The Victoria I saw wasn't size 14, she is definitely size 10. And in the other review claims she is over 50s, which this one is not.

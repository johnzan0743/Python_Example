 CHANTELLE,  Aussie blonde - Sutherland - 0404 215 740

Met up with this bird a few weeks ago, got the number out of the Leader "CHANTELLE Attractive, Aussie blonde. Call 0404 215 740"

works out of Sutherland Motel, literally next door to Lauren if you have ever seen her. Anyway, called her and headed down and was greeted by a very pretty aussie blonde lady in her 30's.
Nice tits, arse and a tan. Started off with some BBBJ and progressed into a few different positions, which she seemed to enjoy but she wore out pretty quickly.
Charges $100 for half hour, will return.

Has not advertised in the Leader for some time. Maybe has moved on or changed area. Pity as I never got to sample her. If she shows up again will post and advise.

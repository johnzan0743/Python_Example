Broke my Locanto cherry today with this chocolate skinned very pretty girl. Her body was a little larger than I would normally pay for, it was the face and aura with the promise if kissing that made me stay...

I was most definately starting the review with the OP, then got a case of PRS (premature review sending)... So here it is sirs : 
Sophie Williams 
Young dark skinned girl
Cost negotiated at 300/hr

Brief summary: unusual punt includes chat on the couch, kissing and groping like teenagers.. Move to the bed for blow job with plenty of saliva, goes for as long as u like... Doesn't like 69 but is very happy to accept a individual growl our...not my favorite pussy, trimmed or tended may be a better word and flaps everywhere.., sex itself was fine prefers man on top or from behind ... 
No return planned but I think many would enjoy this different style of punt

Astute question, most definitely Afro/East Indian skin, small pointed nose, not rounded...

The photo is not her, she openly said its a likeness when I asked and sent tegu a selfie.... The Locanto photo is better than the subject... ..... Bbbj, was specified by me from the opening communication, not sure what the standard price includes ...

 Cracker Con ,Kim and Tina  - Sydney - 0415 937 502

I hate to admit it but I just blew $500 on a punt yesterday.

And what is the chances of of me picking 3 different Cracker adverts for different girls and ending up in the same apartment in Kent St?

The first 2 was in November 2015 and December 2016.
The November punt was for a Korean WL. Very pretty and young in the advert but was a mid 30s Chinese WL.
She definitely would not be accepted the the Asian brothels in Sydney because no one would fuck them against competition.

In December I tried again and it was supposed to be a young pretty Malaysian WL.
Same Kent Street apartment and another 30s Chinese WL.
I should have just walked away but I already drove to the city and parked the car and I hoped for the best.

NO DATY, NO KISS, NO FINGER, NO BBBJ, NO SUCK BOOBS, NO PLAY WITH BOOBS.

Yesterday I saw this beautiful advert 

Private girls , 22 yo s6 Kim and Tina - Sydney escorts - cracker.com.au

They got another advert somewhere but I could not find it again.
They were supposed to be Japanese girls.

Same Kent Street apartment.
Their pictures was so hot so I waited and waited. 
Bloody waited 30minutes for them. Either someone was still fucking or the girls not arrived.
Finally the girl SMS me and tells me to press the buzzer for their room so they can let me through the security door.
I go to the lift but it does not move because you need a security key to their level.
Up and down the lift goes with other people but not to my level.

After additional 10mins I call on the intercom for the girl to come and get me.
She comes in a night gown and sour face.
Fuck not my fault if their buzzer not working to allow lift to their floor.
Also she definitely did not look like the sexy size 6 girls in the advert.
She did have a huge 36DD white breasts which I thought "OK it would be nice to suck and fuck those jugs".

I get into the room and this is the 3rd time I been here.
I take a shower and the 2nd WL arrives. 
Two 35s Chinese WL , both size 8-9, both had big tits and big stomachs. Not pretty either.

I lay on bed and the first girl slips a DOM and starts sucking away.
I tell the 2nd WL to sit on my face and she say NO.
I start arguing that this is oral sex and she say no so I ask her what is her job in a double.
She licks my nipple which doesn't turn me on.
I ask to suck and play with her boobs instead since she not sucking of fucking.
She reluctantly gives in and I such her 34DDs but she keeps pulling them away.

First WL still sucking but I am not getting hard for obvious reasons.
I ask to suck her 36DD and she refuses.
Play with her pussy NO.
OK she want to fuck me and tries slipping my limp dick into her pussy.
She sits back facing me so I cannot touch her breasts. WTF!!?!?

I told her that if this is how they have sex with customers they will go broke.
BUT THEIR ADVERT IN CRACKER TRICKS IDIOTS LIKE ME.

I tell her to change to MISH and she folds her legs in front of her boobs.
If she let me play or suck those beautiful boobs I may have come but NO.

I gave up and told both of them to give me a back massage.

So I got scammed by two used up China WLs to pay $500 for a back massage.

Other 2 previous visits I had the same experience but let it go.
However this is the 3rd time at the same apartment they use different profiles but all reject Chinese WLs.
Honestly they are like the middle age Chinese girls serving yum cha in the suburbs.


I don't think I can print the address here but if it's on the 3rd floor then expect old Chinese WL and not the ones in the advertisement.

Yeah that seems to be the case with a lot of asians on crack/bp. I tend to just skip over them. The photos always look like models or popstars but with some lowish price like 200 p/h for FS. If it's too good to be true it probably is.

Misfit44. Sorry to hear about the poor experience. Please put this down as "punting education". Am sure you will not make the same mistake. Practice makes perfect.

Sorry to hear of such a dreadful punt and out and out ripoff. Thanks for alerting us to this and reviewing ...Reviews like these are of great value to our members. Much appreciated, but mate I have to ask the question...if you have been stung at this place twice previously, why on earth did you go in the third time? Surely the alarm bells were ringing?

They're also doing the same shit down in the 'Gong and I've been stung a couple of times too. Not quite as bad as your experience though Misfit44. Thanks for the heads up.

I like to play the field when I have the money.

Kent Street and Sussex Street is full of WLs plying their trade in the apartments.

When I was waiting outside I saw a man waiting too who kept looking at his mobile.
Obviously he was taking a lunch break with a WL and waiting for entry like me.

This apartment is full of girls because I saw 15 girls come in and out for every one man.
They were mostly Asians and caucasian girls.
A group of 8 young Spanish girl students also came out and stood next to me for about 10 minutes before moving off.

The 3rd floor 2 bedroom apartment was used by students as their residence but during the day it was a open brothel.
I opened the fridge and it was mostly Chinese groceries so this was a Chinese apartment.

I had many success in Cracker and Locanto in the past.
This one is a BIG CON so avoid all the adverts offering doubles with pretty Asian girls.

In past, I found a nice pretty 18 year old student who became my regular GF for about 2 years.
Good thing about GFs is that you get natural services (and everything including cream pies) but it was costing me $1,000 every visit but no time limit.

No risk no gain!

Bad luck dude. From a look at the Aus99 forums I can tell most of the posts are delusional or written by advertisers themselves so I tend to stay away from Asians. You are providing a valuable albeit expensive service in warning us so we don't waste our money.

I wish Cracker/Backpack had an age filter like Locate does. I too skip over the Asian ones and tend to use the age (and the fact the ads are clustered together) to identity them.

Any ad for Asians for $180/30 $250/60 is the same shit.
Asian, usually with professional photos of glamour girls with phone numbers printed on them. 
Ignore the lot of them...

i fell for the same con a week or so ago. Same apartment on Kent St by the sounds of it. Ad was for a cute Thai girl, reality was a less than cute mid 30s chinese chick that I'd be unlikely to look at in the street/bar. Should've walked but little head was doing the thinking. Service was not worth writing a review on. I'm giving up on all Cracker/BP ads for Asians - complete crap shoot. There has to be a business opportunity for a genuine (verified) ads board to kill this Cracker/BP bullshit.

Yep, it's right here at AXR. Its very hard to get an advertiser to tell the whole truth when they have a product to sell. I use the reviews here as advertising without the bullshit lies.We just need everyone to post reports of their good and more importantly,bad punts. Even the average punts are worth a read, especially if they're local to the reader.

Same here Probe, absolutely agree.
My last PWL visit I got all the info I needed from the reviews, I didn't even bother to check for online ads and shit cos the info we get from the reviews is much more reliable, no BS.

Hi All,

I do appreciate the problems of honest advertising.

I mean, who would go to see a working lady with an advertisement that read:

Howdy folks,

They call me the Goodyear blimp because I am fat in all the wrong places. I have dyed blond hair with black roots, cigarette breath and am working to support my drug habit.

My place is a mess and is in a crime infested public housing complex where you take your life into your hands visiting.

I charge $300 per hour, but don’t do a fucking thing for the money or even take a bath between clients.

By the way, I recently became a grandma for the third time.

If a man answers my phone don’t worry, he’s merely my drug supplier.

Jack

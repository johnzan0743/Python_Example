Took me a few goes to book Angela as she is isn't too good with the phone and texting. 

Ended up getting a booking and l arrived at the stated time. Angela buzzed me up and let me in to her apartment. Not the cleanest place, bed sheets would not be changed regularly and it was quite dimly lit. All in all not a great setup.

Angela physically doesn't quite look like her photos, she has a big gut and blackish teeth. Her ass is okay though! But she is definitely not a pillar of health. Had a drink in her hand as she let me in. 

I passed on a blowjob due to the black teeth and went straight into fucking. It was a okay sight in doggy and l shot my load pretty quick, mainly to just get a release and high tail out of there. 


Overall she seemed okay as a person but l wont be returning!

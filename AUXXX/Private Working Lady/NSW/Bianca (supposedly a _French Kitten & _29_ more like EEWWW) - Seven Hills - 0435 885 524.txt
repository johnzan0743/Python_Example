My review

Person's Name : Bianca (French Kitten- but eastern Euro)

Establishment : Private - Seven Hills (says she works at Bondi on weekends too)

Date of Visit : October 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink:0435885524 French Kitten, Seven Hills - Escorts In Baulkham Hills (Sydney)

Hours of Business : 11am > late

Rates : $75 half 150 hr - thought it was massage but was really only fs

Age : Ad says 29 - more like 40+

Size/shape : Size 8 slim but with pot belly not "gym toned" as suggested, about 160cm. Average body. b-c cups, natural. Bad fake wig. Overall very average certainly not the "ex-lingerie model" I was hoping for (well maybe she modeled it for herself in her bedroom or something).

Nationality or Ethnicity : Eastern Euro

Services Provided : some touching of the back followed by FS

Value for money/recommend? : Seriously TOFTT - NO! - I am lucky it was only $75 down the drain

My experience/comments :

I saw this ad pop up and I am partial to a good private massage lady - not much around this area so I am discovering.  I thought I would give it a go seeing as it was pretty cheap, however, the old adage never fails you pay peanuts you get monkeys.

Anyways here goes

House is located on Johnson St Seven Hills - having looked it up on Google maps I donned my best Housos outfit of adidas shorts a bonds singlet and some double pluggers and off I go.  I whipped into the servo at Sevo to get some cash and I though I'll get a little bit extra just in case she turns out to be a superstar - How wrong that thought ended up being!

The house is right on the main road so there is no parking you would have to pull into the driveway to park.  This doesnt work for me, being as CIA paranoid as I am, so I parked around the corner left valuables in the car and I was locked and loaded!

Ring the door bell and she trots over to the door in some high heels her figured looked ok through the screen door but when she opened it I saw her face which certainty was a very very old 29 (now I know a few years or mere puff is standard by most but she was like 40+).  In addition to the aged disappointment she had this really long bad wig on (made Tony Mokbel's wig look top notch - for those who don't know about big Tone's wig)



Anyways the rest of the time was just rubbish!  The only good thing was a nice clean bedroom - No massage table just a bed - I didn't use the shower as I had one before I arrived and I declined to use on when I finished as I just wanted to get the fuck out!

I laid on my stomach and she used some strong weird smelling oil which she told me she got a good deal on from off the guy in the "sex shop" who she knows.  She put the oil on rubbed it around and never even attempted any form of massage.  This was despite the fact I laid there for 5 mins hoping she was about to start the massage - she just kept going for the sack and I think the whole time she just wanted me to turn over for FS (which I never even wanted...).

I knew it was going no where so I turned over she knelt there doing not much and did a bit more rubbing before she said I love doggy.  She passed me a (staying with the housos theme) franger and I whacked it on and proceeded to shut my eyes and pump her till I got one away.

She pulled of the dom after I blew and a few tissues to wipe up - offered a shower which was declined, as per above.  I grabbed a few more tissues and wiped up noticing some blood (guessing she was at the end of her cycle - which is annoying that they can't wait until the cycle is finished to provided such services).  That all added to the wonderful mood.

I put my clothes on, faster than Clive Palmer downing a hot dog, and was about to bolt out the door when I remembered she hadn't given me my lousy $15 change which she went out of the room at the start of the booking to get.  I asked her for it and she got it out of a bag she had in the room... Seeing as she had lied so much in her advert when she gave me back the $15 I said "I'll save this for next time" - I was in and out in 15 mins.

As I was leaving and walking back to the car deflated and dejected from the EEWWW (EASTERN EURO WIGGED WARRIOR WOMAN) I took some solace in the fact the gods were shining on me by not letting me forget my $15 which came in very handy when I purchased some BBQ and rice from the St Martins Shopping Center T/A Chinese at Blacktown (some of the best BBQ I've ever had - which is the only thing highly recommended in this review) and the sunset with the Char Sui clearly, by far and hands above the best part of my day!

Biggus - I would love for you to give her a run and see if I just caught her on a bad day or something...?

Thank you sagacious.

Excellent review of a disappointing service. Thank you for coming to the rescue of the poor bloody punter who might otherwise be sucked in by the deceitful advertising, and I hope the next one shocks and awes you the other way.

I found this review hilarious (I do like reading the exceptionally bad ones!), but I just wanted to point out that it doesn't matter what time of the month it is or how much birth control you are on, spotting can occur. And spotting can be a little or a lot. The fact is, if you're going to have sex with a woman, there is a chance there will be blood. And if you're mature enough to be engaging in sexual activity, I think you should be mature enough to be okay with that. It sucks more for us than it does for you!

yes point taken jenna - such a woman's response though :P 

I am one of those weak wussy ones who can't handle blood full stop! probably would have been different if it was a really good punt and she was trying really hard to provide good service, was less deceitful in her advertising didn't try to dock me the lousy $15 bucks etc etc... the blood probably wouldn't have rated a mention!

Anyways I will hopefully have a more positive review to post shortly...here's hoping!

Thanks for the review sagacious. TOFTT can work both ways, unfortunately for you this way it is only to the other punters advantage.

I have also benefitted from your efforts as I had noticed the ad and it 'was' on the to do list

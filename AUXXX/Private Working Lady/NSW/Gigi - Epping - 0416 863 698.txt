My experience/comments : 
This is probably the worst experience I have ever had. After a stress full day at work, I needed to relieve some stress. What better way than sex? Well thats what I thought. The service was provided at an apartment. After confirming the time through text, she gave me the general street, and half-ass directions towards the apartment through what appeared like photos of the outer apartment complex. After this confusing ordeal, I knock on the door to be greeted by a hmmm... middle aged asian lady who looked absolutely nothing comparable to the images, wearing thongs and bra that highlighted her oversized waist. I was in shock but she bided me in. Her English was very poor, demanding rather unprofessionally "money now"  and not wanting to be rude, I paid for the service. What followed was a covered blowjob with very little passion. It was very obvious that we both did not want to be present right now... Her blowjob technique was mostly the use of saliva with minimal tongue action, unpleasant to say the very least. When sadly my penis became flaccid, she offered to have doggy-style sex. It was very mechanical and I felt like I was fucking a piece of meat. After only 10 minutes of service, I decided to stroke myself instead and came. She handed me tissues and I cleaned myself up. Even though we agreed on 30 minutes, I wanted to get out ASAP and decided to skip the shower. 
Definitely do not recommend- don't be stupid like me.

 My experience/comments: 

Ok, I took one for the team. 

Saw her ad in Manly Daily,  plus in Daily Telegraph.  It appeared to be a new advert which spike my interest.  I called the day before to make an initial enquiry, should have had alarms bells ringing when she claimed to be 42 years of age.  Maybe she was in 1997,  her voice was definately older and not most encouraging signs when speaking with her.  For some reason when the next day came around I found myself with an hour or so to spare in the city, so took the lunge and contacted her again to arrange. When I arrived at appartment block in city, went up and she took me into a very crowded room, invited me to part with some cash and then pop into the shower.  I thought, you never know maybe this will be a professional massage, as there was a proper massage table, plus a bed next to it.  She is a nice enough lady, who proceeded to tell awful jokes throughout the session,  I mean damn awful.  Started pathetic massage, tried to tickle me with one of her toys, and vibrating accessory.  However not in any particular exciting spot or in any particulary exciting way. More like just light touch in areas that are ever less erogenous.  After few minutes of an attempted bodyslide we popped onto the bed and I received rather ordinary mechanical CBJ. I tried to spice it up with some touch and feel and kissing, but sadly this was pretty ordinary also.  She remained happy, and friendly enough and her overall attitude was good.  Just this didnt really translate to the massage table nor the bed.  
If she was more into it,  and playing in right areas during massage and then taking this to bed, would have been a better experience. Plus is she wasn't wearing awaful wig, and had told a whopping lie about her age, size etc....

Overall nice lady, but definately one to avoid unless you want a rather peculiar experience which never really lived upto it's promise.

Oh well not as bad as some, but nowhere near what have experienced previously.

I'd say we're talking 5 out of 10 for being friendly, having facilities.

Noticed the advert isn't back in papers this week,  I believe the appartment was lived in for sure.  Wouldn't return.

My experience/comments : The advert details are Susi with no correct content (similar locanto post with no name but same number.) Decided to take a punt as the advert has been consistent for a while. Anyway easy to find new apartment - shared with 1 (or maybe 2 girls) both work from it. Arrived with no expectations but was greeted by a pretty Chinese girl (Vivian) with long dark hair, sexy lingerie, good English, great smile and friendly so decided it was worth staying. I am not good on age but I suspect early 20's - been here 8 months but has travelled in countries outside of China - easy to talk to. Dealt with formalities , shower etc, lay down on the bed, kissing and cuddles - she has good body, not thin or overweight but cuddly which works for me. Vivian has a really relaxed GFE style so kissing progressed from lips and nibbling to tongues all the time touching and making sure down below was getting interested - no problem. progressed to DATY which was good - shaved, wet, responsive and then back to cuddles, kisses and on with condom. She offered CBJ but I declined as by now was more interested in FS which again felt more like GFE with bit of mish, bit of cowgirl, some shared masturbation and finished in mish but very relaxed. Then she offered some leg massage  - not her skill set - but ok as we chatted about places we had both been to. 
Recommendation: Good GFE - I will see here again

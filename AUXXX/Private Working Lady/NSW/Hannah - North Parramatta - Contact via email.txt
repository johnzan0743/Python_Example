My experience/comments : I apologise for the delayed review a couple of months after seeing this private lady - it only dawned on me that the email contact we had - contained her Backpage link.

Admin - I have provided the ladies real name - I'm not sure of the rules in regards to this - as her advertisement doesn't show this. More than happy to amend and remove if you see fit. 

There's no mobile number provided for the ad so I took a chance of sending an email through Backpage and braced myself for a refresh-ing marathon of my email account. Thankfully I received a reply not too long after, and after a few back and fourth emails confirming details etc I was on my way. 

(before continuing - I note I haven't seen another ad for this young lady ever since our encounter so not entirely sure if she is still working. I haven't contacted her again for another go around only for the fact I'm a gambler and like to keep punting on unknowns rather than known commodities [extremely stupid I know!)

I arrived at her private residence which is in a block of units in North Parramatta away from busy main roads so parking was no problem. Buzzed her room number at the front door and up the stairs I went. 

I could hear some hurried and muffled voices as I stood outside the door before I knocked, and after I did it was a good 10-15 seconds before she answered the door. 

No sign of the other party throughout the whole booking so no issue at all - I just like to know when I need to be ready for a fight or flight experience! As you never can be too sure sometimes. 

Thankfully, this lady was great. She was rocking a set of black high heels, stockings, a short little skirt and a white button up top with her glasses still on - the perfect definition of a school girl. 

We sorted out the financials and after a quick shower I met her in her room where she was lying on the bed. 

Literally seconds later locked in deep french kissing - I couldn't get enough of her - and this is quite possibly the best girlfriend-like experience I've ever had with a punt. 

She was incredibly nervous at the beginning and I got the feeling she hadn't been in the business for very long - I didn't ask as I know it can be an uncomfortable subject for some. 

After we undressed I was staring in amazement at this AMAZING body. Brilliant perky tits and the pussy was what you always hope for - smooth, and so incredibly tight. 

Without word of a lie I must have spent around twenty minutes of the hour booking continually going down on her - she tasted that good.

Her natural oral was better than ok - lots of spit and eye contact. She didn't deepthroat but she very up front about that in the email so that was no issue at all. 

I paid for the FS but honestly I was mesmerised by how gorgeous she was and how amazing she was downstairs - I didn't want to do anything than go down on her and have her look me seductively in the eyes as spit dripped from her mouth to my manhood. 

I ended up COB and even though there was no full service - it was up there with one of my best punts. 

Now I think about it I'm actually pretty annoyed I never contacted her immediately after our booking to organise another. 

Throughout the entire booking it was apparent she was just a normal typical 21 year old girl who has just been brought in to the industry (and that is in no way a bad comment) she was giggly, flirty and damn does she know how to kiss. 

If anyone is lucky enough to get in touch with her she is well worth the time and your hard dollars.

I was never given another name andrewblake. 

I've just gone off her email contact - not sure if that's a real name or not - but wanted to check regardless.

I agree it sounds like Annabelle but I don't think it's her. I had a two hour season with Annabelle on Easter Sunday and I spent enough time DATY  that I pretty well know every inch of her body South our her navel.  Hannah has a clearly visible mole next to her navel and Annabelle doesn't. Unless she's gone to the trouble of Photoshopping her mole out of her photos, there is also no mole in Annabelle's pics.  Annabelle is also not advertising and only seeing past customers at present.

I got a response from Hannah and she definitely doesn't sound like Annabelle.  Given the amount of email and phone traffic I have had with Annabelle recently, she would know it's me, so unless she is Annabelle and playing games, I'm calling it as a different girl.

However,i Think I'll have to TOFTT and book a session with Hannah just to clear this up.

Yes, Annabelle has gone through a few aliases before too. I'm pretty sure its her and I remember that mole quite distinctly too.

Really? Hannah's photos clearly show a mole by her navel. That's not there in Annabelle's.

Had to dig into my e-mails from Annabelle to find this shot she sent me years ago. Maybe this settles it.

If it's Annabelle this explains a lot. I contact her last week regarding her availabiliy and after a few back and forth we agreed on a day 4/4. Send a reply email for the exact time (keep in mind she told me she was free) and I never hear from her after. Lucky I haven't book a room.  Seem to me she is up to her old tricks

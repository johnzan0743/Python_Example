Value for money/recommend? : Ok  

My experience/comments : The usual story. Kept seeing it on cracker and photos looked legit. No reviews so booked. Apartment is in the center of auburn and has security. Organising was easy and was buzzed up quickly.

Opted for 30/massage in case photos were incorrect. Turns out her photos are real and she has had hair extensions done earlier that week - which was a bonus for me as I can't say I am a fan of asian girls with bob cuts. She is quite tall and slim with nice facial features and small bust.

Apartment was reasonbly clean yet had a giant shoe rack at the front door with large selection of different sized shoes for men/women. Interesting. Her room was clean and interestingly setup. The photos in the ad are correct.. yes it looks like wooden garden furniture. 

Showered up and onto the bed. While I had opted for a massage I was not really interested in that so we chatted for a while before moving on to getting me to attention and some head. Apparently fully nude was only allowed for full service bookings. She proceeded to give me a decent covered bj with heaps of eye contact which was great as she had great cock sucking eyes.

This is where it takes a.. odd turn? She kept asking if I wanted to upgrade to fs, and the questioning continued throughout the cbj. After three or four times I shut it down by being blunt and she appologised. Continued with decent action till I blew my load.

Cleaned up and left. Worth visiting.. maybe. Was quite cute and chatty. The pressuring for upgrade was a bit offputting but maybe she would be a good ride. Maybe next time.

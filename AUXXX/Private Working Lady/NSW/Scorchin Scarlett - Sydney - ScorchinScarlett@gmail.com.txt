Hi guys, just wondering if anyone has seen Scorchin' Scarlett?  She advertises on AdultWork.com - Adult Service Providers & Erotic Content - Escorts, Webcammers, SMS & Phone Chat/Sex, Movies, Galleries & Auctions (AdultWork.com - Adult Service Providers & Erotic Content - Escorts, Webcammers, SMS & Phone Chat/Sex, Movies, Galleries & Auctions) and sounds great value for money.  Was interested in seeing her when i'm in Sydney in a few weeks, was just after some feedback.
Cheers guys.

I'm seeing her on Monday, she was quite difficult to get hold of initially. Will post a report once I've seen her.

Guys, I'm sorry, and I don't care what abuse I cop - I can't write a review of this girl. 

The reason is that I honestly feel like it would be something of a betrayal - I had such a great experience with her, it really felt like hanging out with a great girl I'd picked up on a night out, and if she were, I'd want to call her without delay to see her again.

I'll definitely see her again, and maybe I'll write a review then, but maybe I won't. 

I know that guys on here don't review their favourite girls, and I always thought, 'you selfish bastards'. Well I still think that - I understand not reviewing the girl in detail, but at least tell us she's your favourite (even if you don't tell us why).

I've only paid for services from girls a few times in my life, but Scarlett is up there with my favourite experiences of all time, paid or not. 

That's all I'll say, other than, as always, your mileage may vary. 

Oh and one more thing - if you've been holding back in reviewing someone you really loved seeing, take my lead and don't keep it all to yourself, even if you spare the details. It's only fair, especially if you've now contacted Scarlett as a result of this half-arsed review.

No abuse from here morethancurious. Know exactly how you feel. I'm sure we've all got a girl stashed away somewhere about whom a review just doesn't seem right. In any event Scarlett has been reviewed very favourably and respectfully on another forum. Glad you had a great time and thanks for sharing.

@More. There are heaps of ladies that I've reviewed and some that I keep on the down low. And that's with every punter. So as long as you can recommend her that's cool....

Wow, glad you had better luck than I did.  I tried to organise to see her while I was down in Sydney for work but I had no luck with her.  Her initial response time to email was not too bad, and she provided me with her mobile number to follow up on initial contact.  She says on her site she prefers bookings to be made by text, so no worries, gave that a go.  To say response times were slow via text would be an understatement.  After a few tries and several days waiting I finally got a response that she had been 'away from her phone' for a few days, and that an advance booking was not required and that she would be happy to take a booking on the day.... now considering I waited days for a response I was a bit doubtful that this would work.  Once I got down there, I tried texting... and of course no response.  I tried ringing a couple of times and got no answer, no worries I know WL's are often unable to answer their phones... new text sent the next day... all very polite and friendly but still no response by the second and final night I was in Sydney.  I was disappointed to say the least!  Her pics look amazing on the website, so I was very much looking forward to spending a couple of hours with her, but no joy for me there.  Hope you all have better luck!

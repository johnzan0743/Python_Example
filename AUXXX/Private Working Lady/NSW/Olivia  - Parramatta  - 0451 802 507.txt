 Olivia  - Parramatta  - 0451 802 507
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Not Olivia, Coco or something else...

Establishment :  City Motel Parramatta

Date of Visit : 10-1-17

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0451802507 ??One week part time ONLY ?? - Sydney escorts - cracker.com.au

Hours of Business : 10am-  9pm

Rates : $250 hr  $ 50 BBBJ $50 CIM 

Age : 30's

Size/shape :  Size 10 small tits

Nationality or Ethnicity : Vietnamese

Services Provided : BBBJ, FS, CIM

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : Well fella's after giving my own warnings about bait and switch ads I stupidly fell for another one, the girl in the Ad Olivia is nothing like the girl who answered the door. When I called the phone it was not answered but I received an immediate SMS with her details calling herself Olivia and answering with "Hola" to further the illusion that the girl might be Spanish or South American, in reality she was anything but being Vietnamese with huge bucky teeth and not very attractive.  She told me she is a fly in fly out worker who was in South Aus last week and she lives in Perth, so she just gets assigned these jobs by her boss who arranges the accommodation.


Anyway the service was very bland, the BBBJ was average and the sex mechanical she kept doing the Asian thing of clearing her throat and spitting in a tissue even when I was fucking her in mish and doggie, finished with a CIM which she immediately spat out.  Definitely no kissing let alone DFK and I could be bothered with DATY since she was not interested in much at all.

My recommendation don't fall for it and don't waste your time with this one.

I have had a chance to ponder afterwards why I can be such a dumb fuck and not just walk and I think for me it is the issue after you have put so much effort into researching online who you want to see, driving out to wherever they are, parking which can be a pain in Parramatta  and being horny as hell that you just figure when you meet them that it might be better than your expectations and I could not be bothered going through the routine of finding another girl which may end up the same all over again so you just stay and take the punt.  Well my punting experience with these types of WL's has pretty well been on par with the nags which is pretty terrible and I suspect will never get any better.  I hope the rest of the year does not live up to this one !

Good luck.

My experience/comments : 

I'm fairly poor at the moment so have been trying to find something decent for cheap the past coupe of days. Came across 'Olivias' add this morning and straight away thought must be too good to be true. Did a bit of googling and she had been advertising in Brisbane, was hoping she was new to syd and didn't realise she could earn more.

Msged at 9.30, made a booking for 10.30. Get to the hotel in parramatta, she tells me the room number. Knock on the door and a probably chinese lady opens up. "Come in" Me - "Thats not you in the pictures" her - "no not me".

New year, new me. Fake pictures so I left even though she was pretty hot and I was toey. She kept sending me messages "come back, 100 for you, I make you happy" etc. Tried to get pics of her face so could post a real picture, but she wouldn't send. Oh well. 

Went to the nike store at Auburn on the way home and bought 2 new pairs of kicks for under the $150 I would have spent on the fake. Could have been worse.

I was positive I did. I usually always search number on here and then again on google. Must have made a mistake.

 Tiffany Moore - Sydney (CBD) - 0468 990 664
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name: Tiffany Moore

Establishment (if applicable): Private Escort

Contact Details/Address: Sydney (or touring)

Hours of Business: (if known or applicable)

Prices: 1h $500

Age: 26

Size/shape: Body Size 8, Stats 34C

Nationality or Ethnicity: Asian

Services: Full Service, GFE

Value for money/recommend?: Not really. Beautiful and stunning, but didn't really want to f**k.

My experience/comments: So I guess GFE (or kissing) really shouldn't be anything you look for - it's never really good. I don't mind that tough, but she wanted to finish way earlier than I wanted - which is annoying. Otherwise good, and nice massage.

Holy s#!@. At that price I would expect the works and some. That money would get me almost 7 30 min f#@!s at a place like 19a Brodie St

We have asked Australia61 for a contact number for Tiffany Moore, hopefully he will respond shortly.

And yes $500/hr for a girl who didn't really want to fuck does seem a little excessive.

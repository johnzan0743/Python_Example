My experience/comments : I was looking for europian girl. On angelbabe I found one girl with name Julia (given name in ad). Texted her before visiting also asked for a photo and verified. She is living in a good apartment on 20th floor room number 2010 in parramatta.

Once I reached there I saw someone else . That girl was Chinese instead of European. She doesn't understand English and continuously asking money. I said you sent me picture of other girl and argued a lot but she was repeatedly asking for money. As I've no choice gave her and was hoping that I'll get good service. But, I was wrong. She started with BJ and she gave me normal BJ nothing special. Then I started with Missionary and finished as my mood was turned off. She was dead fish very less effort even after paying premium charges. Then I took shower and left. I would request everyone to cross check twice before visiting any private escorts.

Thanks for the review and the warning sunshi. 

Man, that is shit when they do that to you and it looks like she is still doing it. 

I was actually thinking about seeing Julia who's ad I saw recently in angelbabe which says she is from Belgium and doesn't look asian.

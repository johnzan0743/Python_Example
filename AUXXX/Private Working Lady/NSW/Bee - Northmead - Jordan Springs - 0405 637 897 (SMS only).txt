My experience/comments : 
Bee looked hot when she opened the door, offered a shower before and she jumped in to wash me down and warm me up.

We dryed each other and then started to get down to business, she pushed me onto the bed and wrapped her mouth around my cock and began an awesome Bbbj, shot into her mouth she disposed of my boys discreetly.

On with the Dom and into the main event, she was nice a tight and rod me cowgirl, reverse. I asked for doggy and she flipped over and I started pounding away gazing at that tight little arse, I slipped in a finger as I was pumping her pussy and she seemed to love it.

Asked if I could swap holes with my cock and she gave me the OK, slowly push my cock into that dark place and pumped away until I blew hard into the dom.

Had a shower again with her at the end of the session, I will 100% see her again.

Booked in with Bee first up that morning via text.
Very neat and tidy home in jordan springs. 

Instantly felt comfortable upon arrival. Bee was wearing a simple skirt and top, met with a hug and cheek kiss at the door. Bee sat me down and we talked about what was on the cards, exchanged funds and finally made my way to the shower.

After showering i was met by her in the bedroom. Wearing white lingerie. 

Started with a CBJ while i played with her body. Moved onto missionary, spooning and finally doggy to finish. Condom off and finished on her chest. 

Very nice experience. Nothing wild. Bee is very attractive.
 I would go back, even though shes a tad pricey for the penrith area for whats on offer.

Hi Guys
The name here caught my eye!
As many of you may know, if this chick was Chinese, which I now note that she is not, her name would translate as Cunt!
Hmmm, anyway whatever floats you boat!
Where the fuck is Jordan Springs anyway, or is that Bee's  flatmate at Northmead?
Good work Bee!
Regards
Jack

Search the suburb in NSW, seems the authorities are subdividing areas to create new suburbs.

Not sure what Bee have done to you to provoke the above comment but consider reading the attached link to know more about the name Bee,

As for Jordan Springs, you got to be kidding me, that suburb name have been registered for nearly as long as you have registered yourself on this forum.

I have to confess I had to look up Jordan Springs as well, as it was new to me. 

Perhaps a mod may wish to change the thread title if this lady is no longer at Northmead?

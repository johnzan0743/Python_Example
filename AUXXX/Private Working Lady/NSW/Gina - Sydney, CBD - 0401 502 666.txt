My experience/comments : 

I found this working lady in the backpage ad, listed above, she advertised herself working in the cbd. I was around in the cbd at 10pm , was feeling adventurous and wanted to try something new. So gave her a text message to confirm the rates per hour and her services that she included. She got back to me telling me she is free, ok cool, I wanted to go book a session with her. told her I wanted to see her at 10.30. Cool done deal. 

Waited until a guy came out and escorted me to her residence. Must be her pimp or friend, or something looking after her. Anyways we got to the door and he told me pay me the money and I'll leave. Paid and he left. I Went in and saw Gina. She is legit as advertised. She seem shy and I tried to communicate with her. Turns out she couldnt speak english well enough for me to converse with her unless you're fluent in korean. Anyways she told me shower. Got in and out in 5 minutes. 

It was a short session a 40 minutes all up. Everything was mechanical experience wise, BBBJ, fake moans and me doing the work most of the time. I finished myself off. Asked her for round 2 and she told me only one shot. Massage was kinda lousy as it only lasted few minutes. She was very lazy. As I said this whole experience lasted 40 minutes and then I left feeling still unsatisfied. Since there has been no review about this lady I'll warn to all the bros, you dont get what you pay for especially to this working lady. Go else where for better value.

Thanks for taking the time to post that. All these asian ads with their tricked up photos. Almost always a disappointing service and you wonder if you were better to look after yourself and pocket the cash!

Better (and cheaper) to stay with the shops.

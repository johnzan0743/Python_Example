On a previous occasion when i have stopped at the  Bp Petrol station near Warwick farm station, I have been approached by a very rough looking old Caucasian woman trying to sell her wares. I was not at all interested, neither were any of the other customers in the petrol station. I did see her drive off in a ratty old hiace campervan driven by a short fat guy with a moustache who had been waiting for her, possibly her minder.

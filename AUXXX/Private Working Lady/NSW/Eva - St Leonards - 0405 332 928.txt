Gorgeous busty blonde Eva - St Leonards | Escort / adult | Erotic | Cracker

Hello, I’m Eva. 

I attract attention from men everywhere I go. With a beautiful face, and an all natural, athletic, yet feminine frame, bee-stung lips, and the most memorizing hazel eyes you will ever gaze into. I may look innocent, but I have a secret naughty side that I am sure you will help me bring out. 

I’m more than just just a pretty face, though. I’m well educated and well spoken. I'm more than just the girl next door. My playful demeanor, combined with a vivacious curiosity and a sincere eagerness to explore is sure to leave you satisfied in every way...probably in a few ways you didn't even know were possible. 

My service is very passionate and unrushed. I love to spend time getting to know each other an working out what is right for us both. I am open minded and I'd love to play out your fantasies and make them my own. Tell me what is on your naughty mind.... 

So why torture yourself choosing, when you could have it all? With the rare blend of brains, beauty, blonde, boobs, and booty, the only thing you’ll be left wanting is...... more.

horneyhorse, I searched the forum under name and location using the Advanced Search facility (at the top right of the forum) and it did not show anything.

Her photos look good so I suggest you TOFTT and see her, then give us a report using the Template?

Click 'Advanced Search'        - below Magnifying Glass, Top RHS of window
Pull down 'Search Titles only - Pull down menu RHS of 'Keyword' text box (defaults to 'Search entire post')
"0405 332 928"                   - Quote the phone number. Make sure the Phone number looks like "XXXX XXX XXX" or "XX XXXX XXXX"
Press search or Enter.

Hate to pop the bubble but those pics are, as usual for Cracker, fake. Just stolen from various other website, so beware of blowing a wad of money on who-knows-what. 

In fact pretty much all the ads for St. Leonards on Cracker are using stolen web photos.

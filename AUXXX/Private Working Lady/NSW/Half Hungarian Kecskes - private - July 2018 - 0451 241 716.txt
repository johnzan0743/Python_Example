Okay, this is a sad review, for several reasons. 

So I'd picked out a WL in Locanto, claimed she was part-Hungarian. I texted her and asked very directly was she an Asian. She replied "no". Call me old fashioned but that seems pretty clear to me.

Anyway a week later, I called the same number not realising I'd previously texted. I asked her directly was she Asian. She said no. I liked the look of her pics so I made the booking. She texts me the address, when I realise I've contacted her before.

Rock up the place, it's an apartment block pretty old fashioned in York St. Best thing is there's no access control, so I knocked on her door as instructed. The door opens but I can't see the person. I step in but leave my back foot in the doorway.

First impressions the apartment is dark and over-heated. There's a smell of steamed rice in the air. Yes, you're right. Asian steamed rice. I turn to see the WL. Young plumpish and definitely Asian. I said "you're Asian". She said "yes". I said "but you told me on the phone you weren't". She just looked at me, kind of soppy.

Then she holds up a single finger and says one hundred.

Looking back I should have stayed. I'd have had the moral upper hand, could probably have had a good time. I'd say the pics are not real, but she wasn't that unattractive. But to be honest, it was the heavy atmosphere and the smell of the damn steamed rice that got to me. I couldn't wait to get out of there.

So the sad part for me is that she just lied through her teeth, to get me to come up to the flat. That's sad not for the obvious reason but because it's so desperate. Second reason it's sad is she just dropped the price 30% so easily. Man, I probably could have gone lower.

Oh well. Sorry,  this isn't a real review, but it is intel. Make of it what you will!

So, it wasn't really Hungarian, but more Hungary as in Asian pronunciation of "hungry", hence the smell of rice when you walked in?

Yeah I had an issue with a Polish girl. When I arrived at the apartment same deal - Asian. Even held the smart phone to her face asking her if she was the blonde in the photo. She was in shock. 
The review is somewhere here when I went. Wont be going back.

No Mate, you did the right thing in walking, the asians have driven a lot of the good caucasians out of the business, which is bad enough, but now they're resorting to bullshit advertising as well, personally I refuse to  see them , not that I'm racist, just not my cup of tea.

This all a bit off topic and probably worthy of its own thread if mods want to go that way. I like suburban RnTs because lots of the MLs are part of the community despite having relatively poor English. They usually have PR and often have children in local schools. I never go to Caucasian MLs because I feel I am or might be judged in a way that I am not with Asian ladies. Also I prefer Asian woman. Each to their own.

Massageboy, its not that far off topic when you think of it. The regular Asians that advertise are definately part of the community yes. But, when the girls that come here on student visas, for only a few months and are desperate to make a quick quid, you've got to feel for them. They are normally forced into the worst working conditions -- a true meat market. Even the description of the apartment by MaxBedroom exemplifies this. With all the competition they try everything in the advertisment for our attention --- even if it means bullshitting about their appearance and nationality.

Fair enough. I'm fine being judged, I see WLs and punters as both sides of the same coin (coin being the right word!) but understand what you say. And can't argue with personal preference :-)

The last time I fucked a Chinese WL at 647 Elizabeth she asked my if I was married or had a GF. I felt like I was being judged as a potential visa option. Asked me if I had come after 3 minutes of fucking so god knows what she'd be like in a relationship. I stick to cauc in Oz and go native when I'm in SEA.

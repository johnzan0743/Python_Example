Value for money/recommend? : It was ok

My experience/comments :

It was around early April when i decided i would see another MILF of Sydney Booking was easy but you got to book her at least 6+ hours in advanced.

She let me into her lovely unit where I gave myself a shower.

At first there was allot of fondling with her as i was dying to take her knickers and bra off. 

Dominique gave me a pretty rad BBBJ  but she was more about licking like an animal instead of  sucking.  She loved it when I went DATY but its a shame shes not a fan of toys as that does help women get off.

Cowgirl was first and then i finished in missionary. While i was fucking her, i heard the bed snap.

Dominique usually allows COF but because i was the first client of the evening she would only allow COB.

I have seen plenty of MILF's within Sydney but sadly Dominique and I just really didn't click. As  I tried taking her bra off she had to call her security to confirm that all was well. So that wasted time.

It was good to meet her but shes not really 45+ MILF material

Date of Visit : 21st May 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As above

Hours of Business : Notice required

Rates : $300/hr

Age : Mid 30s

Size/shape : Tall, shapely, size 10

Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie

Services Provided : BBBJ, FS, DATY, CIM

Value for money/recommend? : Yes!

My experience/comments :

What you see is pretty much what you get. There are number of photos on her site with her face showing and even though they are heavily (and somewhat poorly) photoshopped, it does give an accurate representation of dominique. I called her up to arrange a meet about 5 days in advance. She is quite playful when messaging. Anticipating our meet and having not had great punts lately, I rocked up to her street horny as hell. She only gives out how to get to her place once you are near by. But it was easy enough to get to.

She greeted me in a sexy pink lingerie which showed off her curves. She is my idea of a perfect MILF. Rocking body, horny and in touch with her body. After showering, I found her lying on the bed. We complemented each other on our looks and I went in for the kiss which was met by her eagerly. While she was stroking my cock, I went in for a feel and was pleasantly surprised by how tight her pussy was. She also has one of the nicest pussies I have seen. I went straight for the DATY and could have spend hours down there. She suggested 69 and gave me a pretty decent BBBJ. Not the best, but pretty good and quite sloppy which I like. I couldn't really get her over the line with my tongue, but she got her self off, while sucking me off. This was a unique experience which I really enjoyed. On with the dom and we had sex in many positions. Doggy was one of the best and her ass is second to none. Nearing the end, I ended up blowing in her mouth at around 1hr mark. 

I will definitely go back, but there are some young hot teens on cracker I want to try before going back to this MILF.

Thank you for the review Raventank.  My bed has not been quite the same since....

As this is my first post on Auxxxreviews.com, let me first say how impressed I am that on this forum WLs actually have the right to respond to their reviews.  I do not intend to abuse this right by challenging a client's experiences, perceptions and opinions, but I will exercise this right to make corrections and comments that are factual in nature.

That said, here is my response to Raventank's review:
* I require a minimum of 1 hours notice, not 6 hours as stated in your review.  However, on days when I'm already fully booked or have other commitments, it is impossible for me to accommodate last minute booking requests. 
* I don't like toys, and I don't need them to climax, but I do need sufficient time and attention, which is virtually impossible in a 30 minute session.  I don't do the whole fake orgasm thing, unless a client insists.
* I always contact my Security Guard after payment and shower, and always in the client's presence (because it serves as a reminder/warning to them).  This takes less than 1 minute, but I can see how this might frustrate the more impatient client.  Rest assured, however, that it does not "waste time" because I am always very generous with time (unless I have a pressing commitment afterwards, or I don't like the client).
* I am sorry that I did not allow COF due to my commitments that evening.  In my experience, COF usually results in red eyes (which take hours to clear), CIH (ie. cum in hair) and trashed make-up, and so it can only available be where my schedule permits (ie.  no bookings or other commitments for at least 2 hours).  I have updated my website and webpages to reflect this.

Hello Dominique

Nice to see a WL taking interest in their posts. Your explanation was factual and I have to agree with what you have stated.

In relation to your security guard. Safety is paramount for all WL's. We have a post about the poor behaviour of some punters and it is always good that people are aware of your protection.

I wish you luck and we may hear from you again. 

If only my wife was as "manly" as you. It would be heaven.

Welcome Dominique,

Nice to see you finally logged on.. 

I will say the greater membership is respectful and courteous to each other and no different to PWLs also.. A mutual respect.. So you will find civilised discussion and comment.. Good or bad.. But civilised.. If it is not.. The Mod and Admin team will shut it down very quickly.. 

So you can be assured of comments and right of reply without repercutions.. 

Enjoy your time and stay here and we look forward to more posts abd comments from you from the other "side" of the fence.. 

AB

Dear gordylightfoot222

In the spirit of correcting only factual errors, I believe the word you were looking for is "mannish".  

I believe many Indian males have the given name "Manish" (Manish)

Would you consider crawling ever so slowly over Dominique until Manish decided he best leave.

I have to disagree with Gordy - I think Dominique looks great. 
I haven't seen her yet, but hoping to soon.

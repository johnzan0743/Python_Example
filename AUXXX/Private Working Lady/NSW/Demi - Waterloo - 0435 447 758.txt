Well taken many years but finally had my what I consider my dud punt, now goint to try very hard not to let rip and if I had been true to myself should have walked the moment I went inside. The pics may be her? But def a fair few years back if they are.

I paid $350 to include Nat Oral. So wasnt what I was expecting, pretty average looking. I know I am know oil painting but I am not charging $350 an hour or my time either.

Had a shower, which was nice enough. Started by laying on bed, guess that was what she called DFK but had far better, even from non working ladies. Had to ask all the time to reveal different stages of undress. There was no taking the initiative with her.

At one point I brushed my hand along her leg and could tell been a while between either a shave or wax. Yuck!

Began jerking me like she was changing gears. At this point I near enough said stop but already paid. Asked for bbbj which was fairly toothy and no real cohesion. 

On with the dom, jumoed into missionary. After about 10 mins and seriosuly thinking of any good looking woman that would pop into my brain I came.

Cleaned up, she did give a nice massage, just right as not too light or hard. Started to feel around as i she was pre-empting rnd 2, made an excuse to go to toilet. Came back and said had message on phone and sorry but had to leave. That was with 15 mins left.

Do yourself a favour and don't bother here guys. One mug punter to the rest.

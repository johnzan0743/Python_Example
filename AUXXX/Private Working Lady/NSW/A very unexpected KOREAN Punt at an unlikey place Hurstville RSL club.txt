A very unexpected Punt
Hurstville RSL club
1 Ormonde Parade
Hurstville NSW 2220
  Ph 02 9570 3733


I met up with an old work colleagues for drink yesterday evening at the Hurstville RSL club, I did not expect to end up TOTALLY RELIEVED!! by a top dollar young Korean hottie in an apartment close by. 

  How do you get there?
If you're traveling by train it is about 2 minutes walk from Hurstville train  station southern side. You cannot miss it. I suggest traveling by car at this time of night.


  What was the place like?
The RSL club was standard as far as RSL clubs go, the apartment afterwoods was very clean and very tastefully decorated.  It clearly was not the WL's residence as there were none of the giveaways such as dining table, there were only towels and robes in the wardrobe, no clothes etc. It later became clear she had a short term financial arrangement to use the place to bring clients to.

  How did it all happen?
I was caught out admiring this hot young asian girl wearing a short red cocktail dress while at the bar waiting to buy a round of drinks when she walked over cleaned up very close and candidly wispered "I can tell you like me, do you want to take me home for $600?"

  I jokingly replied it is true you are very nice but I cannot afford you, I only have $100.
she had a bit of a laugh and walked away to the gaming area obviously she mistook me for a cashed up punter.

  Unknown to me the club closes quite early on Sunday, alater that evening, she walked back over to me, obviously unsuccessful elsewhere and says "club will closing soon, bring your $100 and follow me, we go close by, I give you HJ only, ok!!"

  Shocked I said OK! I bid my friend goodnight and met her outside.

Were there other girls there?
We were the only ones in the apartment at that time, but I suspect she had friends in the club doing the same thing. 

What about the girl?
A very nice young Korean girl, said she was 22 years old, which I believe. 
  Slim and very shapely body, great legs and rear (not your normal asian figure here and far from the standard WL's you find at the regular shops) natural B or C cup but they looked huge on her, long black hair, fully waxed and totally smooth no shaving stubble at all.  


  What was her name?
She initially gave the fake name of Sun which she later confided her real name was Jeong.

What days does she work?
She was very coy about this question and said she only has done this type of work for a few months mostly at star casino, but some pressure there has meant the suburbs are now temporary hunting grounds.  She said "I not bad girl" explained that she has an expensive taste for luxury items and has incurred huge credit card debt and is only doing this till she pays it back which should be very soon.

  Mmm (time will tell)

  What was provided?
A very sensual nude 69 position HJ. "I climb over, not touch there! only looking, ok!"
  With what I was looking at and the technique used, I tried my hardest but could not hold back, it was all over in not a second longer than 15 minutes. 


  Quality?
It's a very bold claim, but this would have to be the best HJ I have ever received.
  I'm not sure how she did it but I felt a lot of pressure applied to the base while she worked the top in long strokes which she held for a few seconds applying pressure to the tip. On my eruption I could barely move, she had a giggle and said "you very excite"  


  Price?
This was a quick totally nude 69 style HJ for a mere $100, some would say, too expensive, I say it was the best $100 spent in all my punting.

Any extras available?
With such attention to detail, I can only imagine what $600 would have bought from this girl. Ahhhhh!!

  Would you go back?
Without a doubt, I asked for a way to contact her, unfortunately she declined, she said "you nice man, I never do again for $100, no lucky for me tonight, only say yes to pay man for room agreement".

  Disappointed I have no way to repeat the experience, I may have to look for a regular Korean shop instead of the PRC type.

  I can never look at a local RSL club the same way again.  I hope my fellow punters experience similar pleasure at their local RSL club.

I suppose it was never made clear if the proposed $600 was for overnight??

As they say in the classics - "You never know your luck in the big city"

Interesting happening, pity you did not clarify whether the $600 was for a night of full service. If so would have been worth pulling some money out at an ATM.

There has also been a spate of freelancers working the room at Dee Why RSL of late - but mostly Thai and Filipina. I haven't heard of any Koreans on "the insular peninsula".

$600 would probably be negotiable too - I would think if she said that, then took a HJ for $100, you could probably get her down to $200 or $250 for the FS.

But well done!! Another hunting ground to explore!

What do you mean IF, 
I go to the Hurstville RSL that often now to find her I had to Join the club and now have been nominated for life Membership....
The embarrassing thing is I go up to every 22 year old Asain chick and say 
"I have a spare $100.00 do you have any time"

So far all they say is 330pm 1015am etc!!
or What the fuck you talk about..

But onward and upward The Banjo's Quest will continue!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Should have gotten her phone number for when you do want to spend a bit more.  Or for passing on business to her :-)

Hey this is a family friendly group of watering holes.... Just a thought but  I'd be deleting all references to the brand of the place as it takes one nosey reporter - and we do know they read this forum - for the fun to be over.

If she's got a apartment set up like that there is likely to be several women and it be part of an agency.

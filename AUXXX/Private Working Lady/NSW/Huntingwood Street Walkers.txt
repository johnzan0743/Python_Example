 Huntingwood Street Walkers
				
Post Content: 
Hey all,

Just thought I would put it out there that whilst I normally don't partake in Street Walkers I thought I would just go what the hey and give it a go.

I went down to the Huntingwood Industrial estate near Blacktown off the Great Western Highway.

I've been there twice over the last week and there is a REAL mix of the girls there. You get your standard looking crack addicts who are easily over 40 and really look like walking STDs.

However there are also a few young girls (18-20 for sure) who are seemingly just starting out and after getting a blowie one time I thought what the hey and thought I would try a nice piece of young pussy.

Make sure you dom up fellas - young or not you can never be too careful - only thing is crabs can't be stopped by a dom. I was lucky and didn't have any issue, but it's just a friendly note.

I went on 30/09/13 and 12/09/13 and Monday and Saturday night respectively - about 8-9pm both times and the working girls will be in pairs - no where near as many as there used to be - but if you want cauc - thats all that is there!

I know this isn't in full review format - nor does it have contact details - but it is just another option for those wanting to punt in the Northwest Area!

Where did you take them to do the deed Sanjay? I've been through there a few times with mates and seen them and had a laugh, wouldn't mind giving one a go if I go for a solo drive but I'd be so paranoid they are undercover cops and I'll end up on the news.

One day I went out to Huntingwood for a business meeting. there was a WL laying on the grass enjoying the sunshine. Stupid me - being dumb- stopped and asked her if she was OK as I could not understand why a woman would be out there. They wait near the gates of the warehouses to pick up the truckies delivering goods. There are also some businesses, like the one i was visiting, where they wait at the gates as well.

Neo, depending on what you are doing with them, they either find a spot in the streets there at Huntingwood or they travel over the other side of the highway into Arndell Park.

Agree with sanjay in that it is not what it used to be 10 years ago, when there were plenty of girls out and quite a few young honeys mixed in with the old crack heads. The crack heads seem to dominate nowadays but there is the odd jewel in the rough that can be seen.

Probably go for a trip out there next week.

also just had a look at the act - no mention of it being illegal as NSW is pretty much decriminalised and so long as the criteria are met it should be fine

The Vagrancy Act was further strengthened in 1968, making it an offence to 'loiter for the purpose of prostitution' (sec. 4 [1] [k]). These provisions were then incorporated into the Summary Offences Act 1970, sec. 28.

Decriminalisation
In the 1970s an active debate about the need for liberalisation appeared, spearheaded by feminists and libertarians, culminating under the Wran ALP government in the Prostitution Act 1979. Eventually New South Wales became a model for debates on liberalising prostitution laws. However almost immediately community pressure started to build for additional safeguards, particularly in Darlinghurst (Perkins 1991), although police still utilised other legislation such as the Offences In Public Places Act 1979 for unruly behaviour. Eventually this led to a subsequent partial recriminalisation of street work with the Prostitution (Amendment) Act 1983, of which s8A stipulates that;
(1) A person in a public street shall not, near a dwelling, school, church or hospital, solicit another person for the purpose of prostitution Â…
(2) A person shall not, in a school, church or hospital, solicit another person for the purpose of prostitution.
This resulted in Darlinghurst street workers relocating (Perkins 1991).

Further decriminalisation of premises followed with the [nsw 6] putting into place of recommendations from the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly Upon Prostitution (1983-6). Although the committee had recommended relaxing the soliciting laws, the new Greiner Liberal government tightened these provisions further in 1988 through the Summary Offences Act in response to community pressure.

The current regulatory framework is based on the Crimes Act 1900, [nsw 7] Disorderly Houses Act 1943 (renamed Restricted Premises Act in 2002), Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979, and Summary Offences Act 1988. The suburbs of King's Cross in Sydney and Islington in Newcastle have been traditional hotbeds for prostitution. New South Wales is the only Australian state that legalizes street prostitution. However community groups in those locations continue to push for re-criminalisation. [nsw 8]

As promised in its 2011 election campaign, the Liberal Party sought review of the regulation of brothels. In September 2012 it issues a discussion paper on review of the regulations.[nsw 9] It stated that the purpose was threefold, the protection of residential amenity; protection of sex workers and safeguarding public health (Maginn 2013). Nevertheless there is no evidence of a negative effect of brothels on the community. [nsw 10]

Great info Leah. Might have to look at these acts a little more closely so I can make sure I don't do no wrongs. Not that I am going to go out and sell myself to others in the near future. Will just remain a consumer.

With all due respect to LL Street prostitution is a very grey area in the law. The law is very ambiguous in this area. 

In New South Wales, it is only illegal to solicit for sex near or within view of a home, school, church or hospital.

Now the problem is that Industrial areas at times include dwellings such as caretakers premises which a lot of Industrial buildings have meaning that it is nearly impossible to rule out not being arrested or charged with the offence of soliciting as a client for the services of a prostitute!

It is an offence to solicit for the act along with engage in the act in view or near a dwelling home school church or hospital.
The operative word here being "near". Well that is what is known as a subjective term. Qualifying or quantifying this term is the point. That is why you are charged and it is up to you to prove otherwise if the case is in that "grey" area.

Now the good news is you will probably beat the charge if caught out in an industrial area however the bad news is explaining to your other half wtf you have to attend court for again. Not to mention the look of scorn on your overworked legal counsel "Didn't you hear me last time?" face.


The following link gives some insight to thinking although a decade asgo is still the current way of dealing with this issue.

http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Pro.../LA19970417005


So the moral of the story is. If you don't want to risk a criminal record. Or becoming part of Police intel; there are unmarked cars sitting observing most evenings recording number plates and observing and recording activities. 
Not to mention the difficulties encountered by the  embarrassment caused by a traffic stop of your significant other and intel being revealed to your partner without you having any clue well that is not bad luck that is simple stupidity on your behalf.

How do i know? I have been very stupid before. Canterbury Road Industrial Estate. I loaned my car to a friend and that came back onto me big time.
I had to take out a writ to have the intel wiped from the Cops system. Thing is like the net. Once it exists it is there forever. Unless you have the magic marker and matching eraser set!

Take it easy. Do not get caught.

That is all.


Biggus.

Don't forget fellas there is the NSW Highway Patrol Area comand at 11 Liberty RD which is next to Stratco. The HWP just question anyone cruising the streets around there. Pull you over for a RBT, and you say to them, guess what officer I am also conducting Random breast inspections, I am not going to blow on that.

As i work full time in Blacktown, sometimes i detour through there on my way home, just to see if anything will catch my little fella's attention, but i guess the time of day i do drive thru's is their busiest part of the day, cos i have never seen a hottie for a couple of years, just the one's that John West rejects.. (Not my name, just a lame joke with the tuna ad's, lol)
Be keen to keep an eye on this post to see if any of you guys catch some hotties there. Any other street area's around Western Sydney now that they have tried to clean up Huntingwood?

I have driven through Huntingwood drive about three times now, as a detour when I was out that way. 

Most times have been between 8:30pm - 10:00pm. 
there does not seem to be a lot on offer at the moment. 

I did pull over for one girl who looked reasonable with lots of tattoos. The offer was $50 for French and $80 for FS, since I was only perusing I moved on.

As some of you guys have mentioned, there has been street girls out this way for years.

In my early 20s (early 1990s) I worked for a small survey firm that did the original subdivisions around Huntingwood Drive. Back then the girls hung out on the Highway, near Doonside Road intersection and the (Sanyo??) HQ.

I remember one lunch time me and the bloke I was working with picked up a girl and took her back to our site office for some fun. We were the only people on site at this early time of development. Was my first experience with a WL - she wasn't a bad looker, must have been mid 30s and wasn't that fucked up. Picking up a girl ended up being a semi-regular thing for the next six months or so. Fun times.

Wow this takes me back! This was my first ever bj. Dirty dirt dirty woman. Don't know how I didn't catch anything(or everything) BBBJ. God she stank. Was afraid I'd never get the smell out of the car. 

I can still hear the noise she made spitting out my mess on the road.

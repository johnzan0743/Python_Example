I saw an advertisement as per below in Locanto. Made a booking and turned up to unit block in Auburn. As I approached the unit I saw another bloke going to the same door, my six sense suspected he was looking for her as well and I let him go in before me as alarm bells started ringing. I didnt follow him up and gave some breathing space but proceeded to knock on door after 2 mins. Saw a glimpse of her as she opened the door and she said she has double booked. What a disappointment all round. Has anyone see her though, review?. Was so annoyed as I was in traffic for 1.30 hours - 

reluctant to go back on principle.

Hi I turned up at her apartment early this year at the requested time and there was nobody answering the door, so definitely one to be weary of, she does not respect clients time. She must have double booked or something

I gave her the benefit of doubt and re booked a day in advance. The day arrives text,call, knock on door to no avail. This one is so flaky you need head and shoulders shampoo for this one. If this is her communication manner, her service is in serious doubt. When I did get a glimpse of her as per above post- she advertises 30 but add 10+15 years. This one is to be avoided at all costs despite low cost- you get what you pay for in some cases

If anyone gets thru to her phone- she also asks your nationality- so this one is also a racist- each to there own. But located in Auburn , its a nationality melting pot so good luck to her. No response with calls and texts, this one is a waste of time with a double booking at first, a no show second time and doesn't even answer calls or texts. Advert says polite and friendly- my arse!!

My experience/comments : 

Had seen the add for this girl, and thought would see if any reviews or details available about this lady. None was evident so I thought I would TOFTT and made an appoint to see availability via SMS with the day /time confirmed. 

I arrived and made my way up to her apartment. Knocked at the door and was greeted by a good looking. She then guided me to the bedroom where a shower was offered and taken. Upon my return she had taken off her dress and was only dressed in lovely lingerie.

We lay on the bed where  we started with soft kissing which progressed to DFK.
At this point I thought I would take the opportunity to explore her sexy body, in the mean time she had taken off all her lingerie revealing a sexy body.

She then applied the condom for a nice CBJ. She did seem to enjoy sucking and it felt fantastic. I then thought I would insert 2 fingers into her pussy which she accepted by spreading her legs to let me insert the fingers nice and deep and play with her clitoris. T felt great and thought would blow my load if we did not stop, so I asked her to stop for a minute or two.

She then offered to jump on top to ride me , to which I said I would prefer mish.

Finished off we doggy and was done.

I then went to have a shower and  was out the door in ~ 30mins.

Overall a pleasant girl and great service offered.

Nice review Iluvasians.

I saw her beginning of March this year - sorry guys, being lazy to write a review...
She actually used to work at Taylors in Lidcombe as Ava, and she recognised me as we met a couple of times there. Paid for 30 mins and my session was pretty much as you described. Her unit is very clean and she got a nice a big stereo system in her room. Very good value for money!

Yes she does ask for your Nationality, I did ask the question as to why the query, & she advises that she does not like to see  any Islanders ( Maoris ,Samoans ,etc ) as they are too clingy  ,her words.

When a WL asks your nationality I personally feel that is quite understandable.... You wouldn't hesitate to walk if you didn't like the WL but she can hardly shut the door in your fave and refuse to see you can she now.  For me personally I listen intensively and can normally pick ones Nationality the only ones I have trouble with are Canadians and Americans. Client often say what's your Natio so that says it for itself.

Whilst we're getting off topic here, I once had a lady ask the nationality question and when I saw her, I asked her why. She said it was so she didn't see someone the same nationality as her, she felt it lessened the risk of someone in her community finding out what she does.

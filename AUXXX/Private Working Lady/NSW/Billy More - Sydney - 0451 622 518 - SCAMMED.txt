  Just letting you know my experience just this last night, have been  played and swindled for more than 12 hours now trying to chase my money  back and calling repeatedly with multiple excuses "my dad is in town",  "the lift is broken etc" 

  This took place is Swissotel on Market St overnight, the WL took the  money and went down the elevator and never came back. Her roommates were  probably in on the con or at the very least did not care.

That's the actual Billie Moore. The one he went with was an impersonator just looking for a quick buck.

The real lady has actually responded to clear her name and the fake ad has been removed.

Pays to read the original post. 

Overall a good result with the damage being limited due to the ad taken down. I can see this type of ripoff being meet with violence. All the punter has to do is buy another sim card, arrange another 'booking' and the fake Billie More will be looking at a punch to the face when she steps out the elevator. Do they ever think?

Then you could be up for assault, or worse she would more than likely have have some big rock ape on standby nearby, and then things could really get ugly.

She’s relying on punters not reacting and just letting it go and it’s a dangerous game she’s playing because it’s based on assumptions that all punters are like those that would walk away because they don’t have the capability. Maybe they are involved in illegal business or associations where they deal with ripoff artists in a ruthless manner. It’s a fallacy to think  everyone who punts are like forum members here. Maybe they’re just on ice and don’t give a fuck about the consequences. Once you start ripping off people like that THEN things really start to get ugly.

Further to that, a lot of punters are from backgrounds that aren't as laid back/forgiving/accepting as Aussie's

I take it you were in her room, don’t know how you could not report this to the police and just handle with being ripped off. I would want revenge. But thanks for warning others always good to be one step ahead of people like this but I’d say she will pop up again impersonating someone else until she’s caught..

Have you ever done revenge IRL and not just your head?  Best thing to do is take a couple of days to relax and then think things through. Nobody here is Charles Bronson and it’s only money. Anything which prevent me from emptying my balls into a girl such as prison (where someone would be emptying their balls into me) is not happening.

I did an outcall years ago to a lovely man in a hotel in Parramatta, he was a lovely man and told me about an experience he had with an escort.
He had a lady come to his room she brought two bags with her, it was an overnight visit.
She said she left something down in her car and needed to go down to get it. She left a bag and took her handbag with her never to appear again.
The gentleman opened the bag and it was full of newspapers.
I don't know how a person can live with themselves doing this sort of thing.
I'm so sorry for your experience.

Punters can be quite vulnerable. We are often nervous, some have had little to no experience with women and relationships and others are in a position where creating further trouble (police, violence) can be a bigger hassle. I'm married, no way am I going to the police, I'd cop it sweet and come on here and have a whinge. 

I'd think about going the violence route for 5 secs but I'd quickly realise this is just as foolish and likely to put me in danger or in trouble.

Yes I have and sometimes it's better not to cool down other times it is ...In this case I would first ring the police not doing anything criminal so I'd get that out of the way first..I personally could not just say it's just money I can't stand being conned I'd give a homeless man $5 without a thought but if someone short changes me or trys to scammed me my blood boils..

I value not having a criminal record. Controlling your emotions is something to look into. You can't hurt every person who slights you in this way and expect to come out unscathed.

My experience/comments : ack from a long spell away and was looking for a MWL.   Found number from the Inner West Courrier and called.  This turned out  to be the old Marie from Neutral Bay (the Mother and daughter act).  She  confirmed this and was proud of this, pointing out to the various ads  from those days and even a few that appeared to be from overseas.  I've  never seen a WL keep a scrap,hook of ads before.  Some of them looked  decades old...

The location is odd.  On a busy street and the door is to what looks  like a dilapidated shopfront. Was on time and was almost bowled over by a  punter coming out.  She is well preserved, chatty and ushered me into a  crowded rom, with a desk, massage table, birds in cages.  A shower was  in a laundry of the room and I took one.  Emerged and laid on the table  for an uninspired soft massage with a bit of undercarriage work.  Then  turned,I've and negotiated FS.  She dommed me up and hopped on for a  ride, chatting all,the way.  Finished, showered, was given an inspection  of the birds and I left.  Pleasant enough.  Not a clock watched either.   One for traditionalists.

I tried her recently and found her to be a waste of time and money even at the price she was charging , which wasn't much. I can't remember what it was as I won't be going back. Her service was very ordinary and uninspiring. She's nice enough but talks too much and performs too little.

What a pity you did not write your review. jwb1 had a good time which just shows to validate the saying that in punting YMMV.

You're right. I should have written sooner but it may have put off jwb1 from visiting and having the good experience that he did. It's always a case of YMMV

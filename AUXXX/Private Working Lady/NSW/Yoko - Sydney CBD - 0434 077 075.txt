My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)
Suddenly I wanted to check out independent girls and she was the first one I Cracker.
I heard of Cracker and felt I might waste money but I had sudden urge to see independent working lady and just had to meet her.

To me she was okay. Not so small in height for asian lady, pretty face and somewhat submissive.
After a shower together, she did some streaptease then into the bed.
She started on top but she soon turned somewhat shy and it was little hard changing positions and all.
Sex was average but I didn't mind as I liked how she was shy but was trying to have some fun with me.
Was the money worth it for the sex? Not really.
I'm not saying I was disappointed but when you think of value for money and all, I don't think I will return.

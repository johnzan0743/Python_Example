jezzykiss I think tinlegs disliked your post because this is the second time you have asked this question in 2 different threads. Something for you to remember.... if senior members such as tinlegs dislike your posts, then you are probably doing something wrong.
All we have had from you since you were given Bronze membership is the 2 reviews that were needed to gain membership, but since then all you have posted is questions, and accused one lady of racism because you had a bad experience.
This Forum is about helping each other not about asking questions. Maybe if you go and have a few punts, write up your experiences in a template review and give something to the Forum you might get some help in return.

Using pictures of Kaley Cuoco (white shirt) and Jordan Carver (red top) is a good clue about the possible nature of the experience. Simple Google image search.

[COLOR=#333333]Playing on Wechat and hit on Ivy amongst probably 15 or so obvious WLs on here but as I was working and earning a little extra $$$ I figured what the fuck, lets try this thing and see how it works.

So, meet is arranged originally for a massage but as soon as I walk in, get talked up to FS - which I expected from the chat messages but, I think if I insisted on massage only she would've turfed me out the door!!  

Ivy starts with a pretend massage before after no more than 10 min suggesting I turn over and proceeding straight to a BJ (covered over a half hard cock to start with).  It's a very good BJ though and I suggest she slows down but she says " you won't stay hard".  Oh, I can see where this is going - get him emptied & get him out...  Oh no missy I think so I say "what's the hurry" and roll over for more massage.  She's obviously not too happy so starts playing with her phone a bit and back to pretend massage.  After a while I figure WTF and roll back over and she tugs me again unit I'm hard and jumps on.  I'm still not feeling it so decide to make her work some more until she tires then start some hard thrust until I finish the job to my satisfaction.  

Quick shower & I'm outta there & won't be back.  Worth the experiment to try a different means of sourcing & I guess no worse than some Cracker fails we've all had![/COLOR]

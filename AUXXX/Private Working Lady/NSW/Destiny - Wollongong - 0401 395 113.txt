Well, thought I'd give her a go. She has been advertising for quite a while and I wanted to confirm she was a different girl to who I thought. What a fucking disappointment. Made the appointment, rocked up at the supplied address. Rang as instructed for the unit number and that was it. No reply. Left me standing on the street for 25 minutes not even so much as a 'sorry something's come up'. Nothing. I sent txt's and rang every 5 minutes or so. Nothing. 

I have absolutely no idea why these girls even bother to advertise. Anyway - her loss. Just another day in the 'gong.

I love a good fucking mystery. So this number is advertised again with a different girls name. Wtf? I gotta check this out. It's killing me lol. So I ring up. Different prices and different address. Booking made. Let's go and see.

Ok. So I should read my own reviews lol but mystery solved. For those interested this girl goes by Shae, Destiny or Roxy depends on her mood. The last time I ran into her was when she was a bit down in the dumps ( see my review when she was Shae) but she looks like she is back to her sassy cheeky self. Definitely a bit edgy and chats heaps and flips from topic to topic. I won't bother reviewing as nothing has really changed except she's lost the weight and and is a petite size 8 with floppy B cups. Not worth the effort it cost. Anything you wanna know PM me. 

Cheers
Kp

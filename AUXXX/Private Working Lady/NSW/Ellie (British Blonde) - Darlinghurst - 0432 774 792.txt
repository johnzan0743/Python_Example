 Ellie (British Blonde) - Darlinghurst - 0432 774 792
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Ellie, 5 Star British Blonde

Establishment : Private incalls/outcalls

Date of Visit : 13/09/2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :  Ellie 5 Star British Blonde Darlinghurst - Sydney escorts - backpage.com
0432 774 792


Rates : $150 for 15 mins, $250 for 30, $450 per hour

Age : ad says 26, looks mid to late twenties.

Size/shape : petite , slim, natural Ds

Nationality or Ethnicity : British

Services Provided : CBJ, DATY, FS,

Value for money/recommend? : Mediocre value for 15 mins, pretty poor for $250/30mins and definitely not for $450 an hour. 

My experience/comments : Was trawling though Backpage ads for non-Asian escorts a few days ago and thought her pics looked pretty good and did 15 mins for $150 which I also liked, as private escorts always tend to be a bit of a gamble in my experience and paying $250 for what could possibly be a dud punt always seemed like a waste of money to me (you're better off going to Stiletto's or Liaisons where you have a choice of girl), but then again I'm a value punter on a budget.

She's very prompt at replying to messages and it was easy enough to tee up a morning session. She works out of an apartment in Darlinghurst and street parking was easy to find (especially compared to WLs working out of the CBD). Opened the door and while her pics are definitely real, (and so, as you can see, she has a good body) the pics blur her face and her face is not especially [/I][/COLOR][COLOR=#333333][I]attractive. She's not ugly by any means, I just didn't find her facial attractiveness on par with my expectations - I'd rate her a 6/10 in the face, she's got poor dentition (an English thing apparently), and an alarming amount of wrinkles which are either a result of or made worse by her fake tan (or is that foundation?). Whatever it is her complexion is orangey and not very appealing combined with the fake blonde hair.

That being said, she is friendly and enthusiastic and has great natural D breasts (which really are so much better than enhanced ones). She definitely likes doing escort work and has been here only a few months. Didn't seem to be a clock watcher either which was good, had plenty of time to do go down on her and finish off in mish even in the 15 min session.

So summing up, YMMV but for me if she had a pretty face and a more natural look I'd be coming back and seeing her as a regular as there was nothing to complain about her demeanour or service, but as things are I don't see the value when you can go to a regular parlour and have your choice of girl for similar money or to a budget shop like 219 Croydon and get someone better looking than her for much less coin.

What's for certain is she definitely isn't a 5 star British blonde as advertised - anyone know any actual 5 star Brit blondes, please drop me a line.

I have seen this girl. I think she is smoking hot, great body and tan, cute small feet, she doesn't have a supermodel face but she is by no means unattractive or even close from my perspective, maybe a cute baby type face if I had to describe it.

I went for 30 or 45 mins. She provided a great service and will be seeing her again.

Well, she's like a 6/10 in the face - cute rather than pretty - but the tan makes her look worse. I dislike unnatural looking complexions and hers is quite orangey. She's also got bad teeth. 

I think at $250/30 mins you should be getting at least 7 or 8 in the face girls. Last week I went to 219 Croydon and saw Sasha who I'd say is a 7/10 in the face girl and definitely better looking than Ellie and that was only $120/30 mins. And then there are girls like Leonie and co who are apparently drop dead gorgeous and are only $200/30 mins. So I don't think she's good value at her prices. You can get a stunner at Liasons or Stilleto for her prices. 

But YMMV. If you're not a face guy you might think Ellie is very attractive.

I know a good and bad face. And I'm just saying I dont think her face was bad or her teeth for that matter. I mean I have seen some ugly faces and teeth in my time but I would not use that word here. 

Maybe I got her on a better make up day or i was to busy admiring her other parts. I'm not saying she is the best value for money but she was definatley a successful punt.

We all have personal tastes on looks and many other things I am afraid. Possibly she had been using one of those fake tanning lotions which, on some skins, goes various orangey colours.

Well I agree with that, she's definitely not ugly and does have a good figure and her teeth aren't that bad. I guess i'm a value punter so if I spend more than I normally would on a WL I expect them to be better than my regulars - hence my disappointment with Ellie. I wouldn't call her a 5 star British Blonde as advertised, that's all, otherwise, like I said in my review, it was a decent punt  - but I don't see the value at her prices vs other options.

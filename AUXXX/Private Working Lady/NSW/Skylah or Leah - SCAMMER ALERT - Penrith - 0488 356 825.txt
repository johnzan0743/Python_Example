My experience/comments : 

I'm embarrassed to write this, but still this might save your hard earned bucks. Read on...

Saw her advt on locanto, photos are attractive as her extensive service lists. Fell for it and arranged a booking through texts in the morning for a booking at 4pm. She did multiple calls out of the blue around 3pm and asked me to confirm me that I'm coming. I wasn't sceptical about the calls at that time.

Later close to booking time she calls me again and asked to send money through sms. I prefer giving cash but she insists to send money to her mobile number to collect from ATM. Back and forth she finally agrees for cash. I was bit nervous now to visit her but still went ahead.

Address given in King st, Penrith, I went close to the agreed time, sent a text message and waited. No reply after 10 mins, called her. She answered and said running late and asked me to park in the basement parking in the same building and wait there.

I waited in the parking for another half hour calling and texting, every time she yelled that she needs 5 mins because her baby and cousins were with her. Finally she came to the basement parking carrying her baby with pyjamas and not even close to heavily Snapchat version of her photos in advt. She asked to give the money, I was in confusion how to proceed while her baby on hand. I assumed she will invite me to her unit which is just above the parking basement so gave her $$$. She asked me to wait, she will put her baby and her cousins in car and comes back.

Again after some waiting and calls went unattended, I came out of the car, checked on the street and no one to be found. Went and knocked the door where I see she came out while I was in the basement, no one answered. I keep calling her and texting her I was blocked. My calls goes to her voice mail.

I was nervous about this punt and shouldn't proceeded when I saw red flags. She did this without any remorse, all I wanted a good relaxing day at the end of my long day at work. I regret and embarrassed to meet private girls after this.

How much nerve she got to dupe a person in day light? I don't know police can help on this. I found her FB profile which she listed in her advt https://www.facebook.com/giinaaniita

Punters BEWARE.

Don't know police will help on this. Anyone have experience on police helped recover the money?

I don't have any proof that I gave her the money, unless if there is a camera in the parking area.

Chances are there are CCTV cameras. It doesn't hurt to ask. I would take screenshots of the add and the FB profile including the phone number and also screenshots of msgs sent. Better to save them now before she deletes them.

Was it a large sum?

I gave her $200. May be I have to check with the building management for CCTV footage.

I took screenshots of the advt, texts between us. To save some embarrassment, I'm still in double mind to contact police.

Maybe just let it go and learn a valuable lesson to turn it into something positive. I was drunk in Barcelona and got a lame BBBJ an ally from a 50 yo whore with missing teeth once and another one picked my pockets. I could see what was going on and despite being drunk if I had resisted would they have pulled out a knife? Valuable lesson learnt for 40 euros, avoid drinking and whoring.

Is that really her Facebook account?

So I am posting this after I PM'd donjon so he knows I am not out to be overtly critical of what went down. 

Donjon, I would walk away from this with a hard lesson learned and waste no more time on it. I work in a business where everyone is scared to fail, yet when they do, and recover, the seniors nod quietly to themselves and know that there is no training on earth that can duplicate real life failure. The real test is how you deal with it, get over it, and move on. You already know I am not having a go at you in any way. I am grateful for you posting the report. It is good for everyone me included. Always listen to what your instincts are telling you. I think if you look back you will see they were actually good, but your impatience for a root over-rode them.

I want to post this, because since I joined this is this the first good example I have readwith many scam red flags, its worth a review of what went down.

Red Flags

1) Her calling to confirm - easy way for her to show enthusiasm and get your looking forward to the event. No bad outcomes from this, but it IS a little odd.  Most working people would not want to let on they were desperate. Good/busy ones don't really have the time to chase punters down and if they try it can send the wrong message. 

2) She asked you to SMS money to her! You didn't do it - good job... but you didn't bail either - so now she knows you are a good mark - by letting you win this, she sucked you in a bit more. 

At that point, your big head should really have taken over from your little head, abandoned the booking, gone home and rubbed one out and saved the $200 for a good session later.

3) The next red flag was the repeated delays. This could easily have been another shit test to see how far you could be pushed. You know you should have bailed but you didn't. At this point, the situation is actually increasingly dangerous for you. She knows where you are, that you are likely publicity shy (aiming to be discrete) and that you have $200 in cash on you.  As I was reading, my fear here was that you were mugged.

4) The appearance of the baby. Wow. She was prepared to neglect the baby for the 30 mins with you? Wow. That would have messed with my head too. What would have happened, if post root, she came down with you only to find that something had happened to the baby?

Seeing a new private is ALWAYS nerve wracking.

You have to really keep that big head in charge though - even though that is really difficult when you are as horny as.

You have to be able to walk away safely.

Loosing $200 is nothing in the big scheme of what could have gone wrong here.

Finally, the girl is a disgrace for sure, but who are we to judge her misfortunes and motives without the full story?

As far as I know. 
The 'KIAH in Escorts and Babes at Liverpool' I have meet is someone completely different with whom had a great experience with and reviewed on this site.
Kiah is not this lady because :
- she is not a New Zealander
- does not have a baby in tow
- does not have star tattoos on her chest
- while similar in looks is different when seen in the flesh
- and is honest and organised.

I do sympathise with Donjon for taking a hit on this one.

Make another booking with a different number. Hopefully she decides to meet you. Theres your chance to confront her and get your money. Now the real question is it worth the hassle and stress for $200 that's your call. Lesson learnt and move on is what I would do and don't make the same mistake twice now that you have experienced this.

I wonder if this has ever occurred to the scammer. She could easily be confronted with someone who wants to deal out some hurt for a past theft, all for $200.

Ok my first time on this site so sorry if this is wrong.

Had a Lady Victoria De Vere visit my motel room some time back and she was stunning.

500 per hour
Offers extras such as BBBJ and greek 

Last visit I had her stay for 2 hours and had a few extras ie the ones above. This Lady is hot hot hot.

Turns up gives you a hug then runs off the B room to change into something sexy (as if what she had on wasn't) and then the fun begins

I remember looking into her eyes at one stage while she was working a vibrator in and out of that sexy ass and her saying and I quote " I'd rather you slide your cock in there"

I think she has changed her name now ?? for some reasone but a quick google will get you there

Afraid this one is missing in action. Shame as she was a real performer. If anyone gets a tip on a name change please let me know as I don't seem to be able to find her

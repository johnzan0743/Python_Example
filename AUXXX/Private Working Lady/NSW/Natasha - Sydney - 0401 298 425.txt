Thanks for the review DT, do you have contact details for her?

If you can cut and paste the Cracker ad that would be good too.

And just as a side note - can we please not encourage Natasha to take over this forum as a free advertising avenue the way she has done on another forum.
Nothing against the lady or her services, she gets great reviews, but she is pretty keen on the self promotion and the sight of her own words.

This lady has a record of making disparaging remarks and comments about those who have joined this forum and this forum as a whole. She seems to seee it as a betrayal of loyalty to another forum.

I would discourage you from allowing her to comment freely or even join this forum. You will find many of those joining here - working ladies in particular - have come here as a result of her spamming and ranting at members.

But it is your forum...

Hi tbh,

Please note that this thread is for reviewing Natasha as a sex worker, not as an individual on a forum. Note what Admin has already said.

We'd ask that you confine your grievances with any one person to the forum where you have that grievance with them.

Cheers,

s.o.o.

hello tbh,

to add to my fellow moderator SOO comments..

to end this thread in a civilised manner.. 

she can say what she likes about this forum but all the more better for us.. it will channel those that are discouraged and put off by the constant barrage of post whoring to us.. 

as mentioned we will not tolerate nor condone such behaviour here.. 

every member here is treated equally and with the utmost respect and empathy.. we are all different and have different wants and views.. 

and this forum WILL provide this..

my views would be reflected as a whole by all those that are here..

I joined this site from the information provided by this WL on another site. Unfortunatley she virtually took over that site with constant unhelpful spam, and trashed the members who left to join this site.

Admin and mods, please watch this WL - she had a lot to do with the downfall of that site.

She supposedly is being lured to Hollywood with an offer of becoming an international porn star, so she mightn't be around here for long.

Post Content: 
Although this is my first review in here, I can recognise a number of user IDs from elsewhere. I have been off the punt for some time now, and in fact have not had a punt in 2010. I haven't gone on the wagon, just a combination of factors. But I haven't left a review anywhere else on my last punt so I might as well leave it here.

I decided to shout myself a pre-New Year's Eve present and took an hour with Natasha. I have no doubt that there are other reviews of her in here, but until I get this posted I can't read them so apologies in advance if I go over old ground.

When I saw Natasha she was working from a unit in a large complex at Moore Park. I've seen a number of WLs at the complex and have never had any issues with the premises. I was greeted at the door by Natasha and we immediately launched into a DFK embrace. Her ability in this regard with her tongue had me confident that I would enjoy my stay. I booked an hour session which is something I rarely do. In the room, before showering lil Badj was already in her mouth. Then, after that taster into the shower for a clean up and then a return to the bbbj.

Natasha really is an expert at bbbj with great use of tongue, DT and lots of suction.

As the second coming for me is often, nay, usually, a rarity, I was trying to save myself for one big load at the end, but Natasha had other ideas. CIT without a drop being spilt. Then on to some DATY. Natasha then tried vainly to get me over the line again but it wasn't going to happen. She was so determined that I'm sure she went overtime in pursuit of her goal, but I was more than satisfied with what I had both received and given and it seemed silly to labour the point, as, indeed, the point was becoming quite sensitive after a solid hour of attention. A clean-up showerand then she asked me to join her for a drink and chat on the verandah.

Natasha is a really lovely lady and is determined to provide a great service and to please. Funnily enough, though, despite the quality of her service and her being a really lovely person, something just didn't click for me. I put that down to the fact that before the session I had taken half a viagra that had been given to me by another WL at an earlier session. I had wanted to do Greek with that WL but lil Badj hadn't been up to it so she had given me the tab to take before my next session with her. As I understood that Natasha also offered an anal service I took the tab before heading off to her apartment.

I am not someone who would normally take something like that that hadn't been prescribed for me and am getting on in years and haven't had a medical check-up for yonks. So as soon as I had taken it I had visiions of me having a heart attack, and imagined all of my friends laughing at me stone dead with a still erect penis in a WL's premises. So that was really in the back of my mind the whole time. Plus, it seemed to me that there was less sensation than I was used to. I cannot believe that was anything to do with Natasha's technique or service and again put that down to the tab. Plus, it was frustrating to have this erect penis but be unable to unleash the second load. Again, I don't put this down to anything to do with Natasha.

I've learned my lesson and will not use the tabs again unless and until I have had them prescribed for me. 

A really good session with some self-induced deficiencies. Despite them I can highly recommend Natasha's services. And I should make it clear that my absence from punting has had nothing to do with my time with Natasha. It's a combination of holidays during January, too much work and poor cash flow. I had been promising myself a punt over recent weeks but had heard that Bridget was back at Amanda Heavens and was determined to make her my first for 2010. So far I haven't been able to tee it up but I'm hoping that in the next days or weeks this will occur.

Cheers

Badger

Thanks AB, and thanks for the invite.

I've stayed right out of the issues that have developed elsewhere. And I'll be honest I have a sense of loyalty to the old place.

I can understand the frustrations of some of the punters in here about Natasha's forum activities. But having met the lady I really don't believe that she is malicious or just a self-promoter.

I had intended to tell her at our session that I thought she should ease up on the forum use, but didn't get the chance.

I've been involved in some pretty serious "blues" on other forums (devoted to topics unrelated to this site), generally trying to hose people down.

What I think we all need to appreciate is that internet communication is not a particularly good form of communication. Firstly, it lacks the nuances of one on one communication. If I'm having a sly dig at you in person, the fact that I'm joking will hopefully be reflected in my body language and facial expressions. That can't apply in this sort of community.

Secondly, when a misapprehension arises it is likely to grow exponentially. If you misconstrue what I am saying and react accordingly, the likelihood is that you will say something that will inflame me, and I will return in kind. The original issue gets lost as the flames grow higher.

I will be honest, what had occurred elsewhere had me in two minds as to whether I would see Natasha. I didn't know the rights and wrongs and didn't want to know.

But as someone has said elsewhere in this thread. what Natasha does on another forum doesn't really matter in here unless and until she comes in and starts doing what has offended people in here. 

Surely what's important is her service. And it's pretty fine. 

I've probably only added fuel to the fire of this "off topic" debate, which I guess only reinforces my view that you can't cure a misconception that arises in internet communication by engaging in more internet communication on the topic.

I'm probably being  a bit presumptuous as a newbie in here, but it seems to me that we either keep this as a review thread of Natasha (with the opportunity for those who have problems with her non-WL activities to post elsewhere on the site), or that she is off limits for reviews. Otherwise, it seems to me that those who don't like her for her non-Wl activities are going to upset those who like her for her WL activities, and vice versa, and the sort of environment that occurred in another place, and which, I gather, led to this site being started, is likely to rear its ugly head again.

Happy for this post to be deleted or transferred elsewhere if that is deemed appropriate. But I'm not looking for an argument. If you disagree with anything I've said, please PM me rather than respond to this post.

Cheers

Badger

Hi i too have noticed Natasha seems to cause many storms in a tea cup.However as a WL she offers a great service. I have seen her a couple of times in the past and must say she tries very hard to please. I think she gives outstanding bbbj and allows full on face shagging. At one stage she layed on her back with her head over the edge of the bed as i stood behind her and rammed my cock down her throat. cum to think of it i have never fucked her,just cant go past the DT bbbj. After writing this, i feel a need for a visit soon lol

NATASHIA # 0401298425 Mature Russian P.W.L. @ Surry Hills... There was a bit of a shit fight going on Australian XXX Reviews - Australian XXX Reviews featured ladies about a P.W.L. where one well known P.W.L. was debating several Punters on the forum about her telephone service and restricted hours etc ? and after going through all links on that P.W.L., I found a site I have not seen before Escorts Australia - weRescorts and found an advertisment for "NATASHA the DUCHESS" a horny looking blonde 42 Year old 5'9" size 12 RUSSIAN Cougar based in Surry Hills who is charging $250per hour...after using the SEARCH on both MHG & AUXXXR, nothing came up and after a GOOGLE search her name was mentioned in AUXXXREVIEWS and Admin / AB kindly sent me a PM to this link...ING her name. Now I think this is the Natashia who set up a couple of Russian MILFS in a Terrace in Surry Hills then moved to Botany Rd Alexandria...if it is, I remember a couple of fantastic punts I had where she bought out the Vodka after I had screwed her....here advert says she only works MON, WED, FRI & SAT 10am to 9pm so she clearly points out her hours and her services include French, Anal, Toys, Rimming, Golden Showers at no extra cost......what more could a horny middle aged baby boomer want..........SeaRay

I doubt it SeaRay last time I seen Natasha and Meeki  together in coffee shop at Surry Hills they looked fantastic together and they told me they were getting married.  You will probably find her old no is disconnected now. I hope they both live happily ever after together and I say this sincerely.

 Abby & Tara - Liverpool - 0450 974 646

Abby & Tara work together out of a motel in Liverpool. Motel was very rundown, smelt of cigarettes, altogether quite a dump. Advertised as size 10 & 12, but disappointed to find they were more like size 14 & 16. Both young, early 20's, one is Polynesian, the other Caucasian. Besides disappointing looks, both were very friendly and eager to please. Paid $200 for double BBBJ + CIM. Probably wouldn't go back because of location. That said, a double BJ is quite an experience!

These sound like two young girls that worked out of the Fairfield area some time back. Advertised in the local papers and you had to book two days in advance so as they could arrange a motel. I did not take advantage of their services however, from a fellow punter friend of mine who did, said he quite enjoyed the experience despite the less than savoury surroundings. I guess it makes sense that they would choose the least expensive accomodation so as to have a decent return for their labours.

Cheap motel rooms are around $80 for $100 to $120 you can get a nice or tidy room you would think they would prefer something clean and tidy for the extra money

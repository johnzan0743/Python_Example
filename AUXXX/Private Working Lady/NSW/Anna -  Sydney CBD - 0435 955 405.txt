So was browising Locanto and came across her ad. She seemed to ok and the price o $150 was incentive enough to contact her.

Texted her and she was quick to respond, asked the usual questions and we booked a time.

She is located next to central so that was easy to get too.

Got there and she sent me her room number. Getting to the room and she opened the door.
First thing she is larger than I expected but not in a bad way.
She is tall say about 5"8 so good height  for me. She does have really nice eyes. 

I have a shower and when I get out she is just wearing her undies.
Nice breast a bit small her frame but a good mouth full. Nice ass as well.

We get down to business where she gives me a good cbj. She sucks me for some time and then junps on. She rides me and having her on top is a great sight.
After a few minutes we switch and move into miss possition, where we continue for a bit. I then feel like im cuming so i pull out and come all over her stomach. Nice

A few minutes of rest and chat and we then resume. Another good cbj then she starts riding me, this time with more vigour and enthusiasm. Im sucking on her tits, grabbing her ass. Then we switch to doggy where  the fun continues. A few minutes of that and I'm ready to blow. Take the condom off and blow over her back.

Head off to have a shower and I'm off with a smileon my face.

A note she does do BJ and CIMWS or COF but its a extra $50

Cheers,
Big D

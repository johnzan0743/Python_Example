Folks,,

I've posted a similar add on another review site,,, but passing the warning as much as I can!!

Cracker users may have noticed a bunch of new, Asian and European women, all good looking, working in north Sydney. If the address is Pacific highway,,, near the corner of walker streets,,, then keep walkering !!!

I called,,, spoke to a girl who sounded european,,, photo looked fantastic,,, asked if the photos were real,,, and made my booking,, only to be greeted by a Thai girl who was nothing like the photo. While the actual service was ok, the constant ' you so handsome,,, you have girlfriend,,, you so big' crap was a chore,,, I blew my load in a grotty apartment and got out of there....

All a big fake,,, this girl went by the name of Cindy but it's easy to spot the fake adds...

Happy punting

Hi TP,I as surprised that you decided to continue with the service after you knocked on the door.
Personally if the girl didnâ€™t match photo and I  felt awkward I would not have entered the place.

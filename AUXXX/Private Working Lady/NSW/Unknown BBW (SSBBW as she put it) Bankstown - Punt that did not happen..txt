 Unknown BBW (SSBBW as she put it) Bankstown - Punt that did not happen.
				
Post Content: 
Well, the other day I checked out Locanto and found an ad for some asian BBW chick in Bankstown that was desperate for money but not much other info other than she offered 'any sex'.  So I offered her $100 to fuck her in both holes if she does an incall at hers.  Yep, accepted.

I got in touch again this morning and told her I would like to visit, what's her address.  This was all done via PM'ing.  I got the address, 30min away, and head off, excited at the thought of doing something really different. An incall in a private home and a BBW (LOL, I just typed that as BBQ and had to change it.....well, she is kinda meaty and I have a thick sausage!) hahaha.  Anyway, I had a hard on most of the way over.  

As I was near she said she was in the 7/11 near her home.  I pulled in and she wasn't there.  Sent her a message saying I was in the Green Commodore.  I looked around and could not see her, then I suddenly noticed this 'larger lady' in my rear vision mirror.  Fuck, dab her in flour and jab the wet spot, I thought.  I got out and greeted her, she asked if I was John (original, aren't I?) and I said hop in.  I asked her if she was busy from the ad, she giggled and said 'yes, very busy'.  I think I lost half my hard on thinking of all the Bankstown sloppy seconds/thirds/forths in this fat chick.........   As we drove away and I went to turn down her street she asked where we were going.  'Your place', I said.  'No', she said, 'my parents are home and they are strict' (like I'd want to fuck her while her parents are home), but not only that, I quickly realised when she said that sentence that she was obviously mildly intellectually disabled too, hence her size was not just from overeating (or not like you or I overeat).  Now I will fuck a BBW for an 'adventure' but I will not fuck someone intellectually disabled.  

I dropped her off just past her house and head to 19 Pritchard.  

Thinking about it now I actually feel quite sorry for this girl and a little protective.  Can you imagine if this was your daughter?  Yes, she obviously has enough intellect to place an ad, reply, dress nicely (as nice as size 32 or so can be), and meet someone to go off with them for sex, but that doesn't mean its a good thing for her.  Some say us punters take advantage of girls, and in this case I would agree.  Its made me a little sad.

Yes, that's pretty disappointing if others are taking advantage of her.  Good on you though.  Also feel sorry for her parents.  

PS. What did the SS stand for in SSBBW?

I contacted Locanto the other day suggesting it may be in her best interest if they delete the ad due to a possible intellectual disability, and it is now gone.

Agreed. Jilamint, I applaud your actions. The recent stories/reviews of Sky in Zetland (aka Chloe) as well as Storm in Pendle Hill have put a damper on reading some of these reviews. I guess I just don't want to peek behind the curtain and see the ugly stuff, ever. I just want to get off. However, its hard to look away when you hear some of these stories. Probably lots more like them, and I've probably fucked them too without asking, hearing or obviously ever knowing.

Sounds like Sophia ( i think) that used to work from home in Rockdale. Not only was she short a few sandwiches from the full picnic but her sister was often in the unit and her lift went nowhere near to top floor!

They say karma's a bitch, but occasionally she can be a surprisingly lovely lady.  May she reward your good deed by helping you get in the pants of that chilled pothead you've got your eye on.

 Obviously you didn't read the review or just like taking advantage of others... OP has posted that the lady have some intellectually disabled and it's best not to be contacted!

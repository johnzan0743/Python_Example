My experience/comments : 
Shape wise she is quite tall, broad hips/thic ass. Pretty face i think, tho it was quite dark. She took a fair while to get back to my initial enquiry.

I spent 20 mins or so with her, paid for a 20 min car service in Penrith. I was a little nervous about that, but was fine in the end. She was very punctual and clear in directions. In the booking it was pretty short and sharp- not a lot of chit chat- i paid her and she gave me a fairly decent bbbj. I think part of the fun of it was being in the car parked on the side of a street haha. She was very clear not to CIM (as that costs extra). Overall was pretty fun, and worth it if its just a quick car job you are looking for.

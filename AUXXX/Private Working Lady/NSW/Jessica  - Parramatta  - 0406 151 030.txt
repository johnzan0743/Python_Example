My experience/comments : 

 I am a stupid bastard, another bait n switch ad.  I was desperate and texted 6 different ads from cracker and this was the only one that was available.

An OK apartment complex up near the Novotel

Shown inside and my heart sank, this was not the girl I was hoping for she looked like she had been around the block a few times and then some, tried to usher me into a room and another bedroom door opened and a very attractive girl poked her head out but alas she was busy.

What proceeded was a terrible mechanical BBBJ and fuck , it was terrible, I pulled out and told her I was ready to blow in her mouth so she quickly got on her knees and I stroked myself to blow my load which she barely took in her mouth and spat it out in a record time.

The whole time I was there her phoned pinged constantly , presumably other dumb punters like me and of course she kept checking her phone.

Total waste of time, avoid

Yes Sandsifter unfortunately this is the third time I have been burned, I have tried to change my tactics and only scout out ads that I have seen for at least 3 months in the hope that they are genuine but to no avail as yet. The trouble is that the ads are so sorely tempting that I find it hard to not just take the chance and have a punt !

My experience/comments:

Still kicking myself over this one - multiple clear WRONG WAY GO BACK signs were present but I stupidly kept proceeding hoping for the best...

Spotted "Amanda's" ad on cracker. Suspected the photos were too good to be true given the prices however only one of the three came up in a reverse image search. The video also did make it more plausible that they might be real. Decided I was up for some cracker fucklotto, so shot a text off to the number in the ad. Almost immediately received a text back from another number 0406 239 059 reportedly to be from "Amanda". Okay, so the initial number 0424 098 796 is for the pimp. Arrange a time and am directed to 354 Church St. Get there and am told to buzz unit number 310.

Let in to the darkened room by the WL. Clearly not the same as the photos but wasn't really expecting that anyhow - in the dim light she kind of looks okay. Asks how long I want and am quoted higher prices than in her ad. I nearly walk but she quickly agrees to the advertised price along with lots of promises of "good service". I'm led in to a bedroom and am left to nude up while the money is squirreled away somewhere. "Amanda" returns and strips. In better light and with no clothes on she suddenly appears noticeably less attractive, but she's got my money now so there is no going back.

Little bit of foreplay and she moves to get a rubber for the BJ. I protest that her ad said BBBJ but that turns out to be a $50 extra. On with the raincoat and "Amanda" commences a lackluster BJ - so much for the "good service" - and I rapidly loose interest. Now pissed at the shameless deception and having been so comprehensively had, I just get dressed and walk out. Punting eh?

Am pretty sure now that there is no "Amanda" and is just the bait for the ole' bait'n'switch routine.

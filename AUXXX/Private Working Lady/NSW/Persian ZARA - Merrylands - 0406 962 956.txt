 Persian ZARA - Merrylands - 0406 962 956
				
Post Content: 
In my Local Rag is an advert for "Exotic Persian Zara tall blonde busty kinky & friendly & ready to please you 0406962956".
Upon Goggleing her number up comes her web site http: www.persianzaraescort.com/contact/ which show several photos of a is a good looking MILF (she does have veins and dimples on her legs which reveal age) and that she is in Merrylands but it is interesting that below her advert is one for Nasha the Merrylands Indian 0402570826 and one wonders if they are both working from the same unit in Railway Pde. COST $160 per hour
Even though I have now retired from active punting, Persian ZARA does look delish and could be work a visit !

Upon looking at that website and the gorgeous picture on the front page....I thought something seemed amiss between that picture and the rest.

Sure enough, the picture is NOT Zara's face.

I've not visited, but just a heads up.

Perhaps... but readers can be well assured that this forum would be far less informatively adventurous without him. Young punters pay attention...

Did you know the letter 'o' is right next to the letter 'i' on the qwerty keyboard ...
She might have been blind when she wrote it though

She has a couple of ads on Cracker which indicate no BBBJ, no CIM no anal, maybe she is still worth visiting if she is a stunner but I will leave that up to someone else to toftt first

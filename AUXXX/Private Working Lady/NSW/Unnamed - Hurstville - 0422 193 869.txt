TOFFT took on a meaning today. Name not known.

I rang this number a few weeks ago after I spotted it in the St George Leader, found out her charges and where she is located and put it in the memory bank. Well, I wish dementia or alzheimers had set in because after attempting to visit a newly opened massage shop on Forest Road(which was closed and appeared very legit from the outside) I remembered this number.  Called it and she happened to be free and gave me her address, rocked up to her unit in Hurstville. 

Should have spun around and walked but was fairly horny and you never judge a book by its cover.

The lady was old, 50+,bit chubby, but neat enough and you know how it is, some of these older women go off like firecrackers. 

Negoitiated 30 mins for $80 and pulled out 2 $50's....she instantly said "no change, you want 40 mins?", luckily I said no and scrounged in the pocket and found the correct money.

Got nude and lay on the bed waiting. She came back and saw I was hard and had a giggle. I must say at this english is limited and more like engrish.

Then she disrobed and fuck me, the worst C-scar I have ever seen, must have been cut open by some hunter and gatherer and sewn up by the local 90 yr old with a needle and thread. The scar was holding back rolls of fat. On the positive side her tits were ok, not to big and the nipples pretty good. Had to get focussed because at this point walking wasnt going to get back my $80, so i played with her nipples, had a bit of a lick while she touched my cock. That was okay, felt around between her ass and her slit was pretty wet, so I thought this could be okay. Then the phone rang....brief conv...."my friend...we going shopping".

She dommed my up before I knew what was happening, she had my cock in her mouth for a savage kinda CBJ. Meanwhile I wanted a bit of pussy play and just managed to feel those juices again and the CBJ was over (i reckon no more than 15 up and downs, no licking or caressing) and she was trying to mount me. My efforts to slow the process and actually enjoy were met with stares misunderstanding and kind of that "no engrish" look. By this stage it was an act of god that I was still hard, so I thought fuck, I going to fuck thisl war relic as hard and as long as i can.

She slipped over me easy and she was pretty wet, she jumped up and down hard and quick (no slowly getting into it), this felt okay but I wanted her to forget about trying to get me over the line in Usain Boltesque time. So I got her to squat on me, knees up, which I grabbed and proceed to rock her back and forth. Some WL's go off with this style as the cock actually rubs over the clit as it goes in and out, others cant cope or get to sore from it. I thrusted her back and forth as hard as I can, I could tell she she was enjoying it, fuck she was really wet and the facial expressiions werent fake, but then just as I thought I had her submitted to a flooding type orgasm, that fucken phone went off again. She jumped off and I said dont answer it. She said okay..."doggy?". Fuck it why not, the view was much much better LOL, and I smashed her as hard as I can. Midway through she said "do you like fuck anal", I said yeah, and she said fitee (meaning 50), and I said next time as this shocker wasnt getting any more of my cash.
Anyway after 5 mins of doogy I said turn over and she said ..."handjob cumming"...I said not yet I still fucking you. Went for the standing mish and just before I put it in, I rubbed the head of my cock on her clit..."she siaid  NO No No....I know what cumming" So fuck it, pumped her for a minute and then made her jack me off.

If the fuck wasnt close to the worst I've had, then the HJ sped rapidly past it. She tried to shake me that hard and fast I thought she was going to dismember me. She gripped it harder the a fuckin Boa Constrictor until I said softer and slower. After what seemed like 10 mins(probably closer to 5) she got me over the line but it doesnt end it. Fuck me just as I was blowing she cover me with a tissue and gripped me again in that Boa handle. I dunno but I think I just blew in self consciusness just to  get it overt with.

After all this the fucken phone rings again....my friend my friend hurry hurry.

She got me out of there in record time, rounding me up like a sheep dog pushes the sheep in to the chute. And about 6 mins short of the 30 mins....thank fuck I didnt take the 40 or longer option.

In summary, she is from the Mao Tse Tung vintage, bum ugly esp in the nude, quickest CBJ, doesnt want to make you cum and gives you a life threatening HJ at the end.
What a waste of time and money, and its moments like these that make yourself wonder what the fuck was I doing there!!


"A Void" as such is a blank/hollow space in a building (usually a unit) where airspace exists but no floor and sometimes no ceiling exists.
Fellow punters, Bros and whoever else may have considered visiting this PWL......."AVOID". As I left the building I had this blank/hollow feeling.



BTW as she was shunting me out the door, I asked her name (for the review and future reference), but she wouldnt tell me....alll she could say was hurry hurry my friend my friend coming.

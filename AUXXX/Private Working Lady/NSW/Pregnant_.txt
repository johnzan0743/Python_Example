I've been in touch with her. $350 for an hour, less for shorter sessions. Central CBD location.

Does the name "Alicia Bliss" mean anything to anyone?

I also have been in touch, unfortunately unable to organize a time this week (largely due to conflicting availabilities). Didn't sound 'dodgy' on the phone. Will atemptto see in the next few weeks, limited availability will make it difficult for me

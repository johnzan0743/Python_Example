Greetings gentlemen.

I contacted Jordan this evening and I really felt I was polite and friendly, only to have the following sms conversation.

Me:  Good evening.  May I ask your availability over the weekend? Also do you offer an incall service, as I can not host.  Thanks.
Her:  Which site you see me.  Jordan.
Me:  Sexportal
Her:  Last time you looked at my site Sexportal was babe???
Me:  About 10 minutes ago
Her:  Yr questions are weird ridiculas seriously.  I suggest you take a serious look at my site and actually read it if you do read all I read was complete rubbish.  Do i do incall is yr question Cause you can't host!  (she links the page)  OUT/IN FULL SERVICE $100 HR JORDAN AGE 46 AUSSIE , Independent escort in CBD DARLINGHURST, New South Wales - Sexportal.com.au
Me:  I apologize for wasting your time.  Have a good night.
Her:  Look Fuck head read my site you stupid prick
Her:  Drug fucked game player
Her:  Don't you ever ask Moran questions  My ad says Incall you idiot

At this time I blocked her contact so I am not sure if she persisted.

Ok so I admit the incall detail was on her page, but as I have read previous ads on other sites stating she does not do incalls I thought it would be sensible and smart to ask her and confirm this detail.  

I guess I am posting this because I am wondering if this is actually a fairly common occurrence, receiving a lashing from a working lady over something like this.  She did seem particularly bothered so perhaps she was having a bad night.  

I would love to hear other guys thoughts or experiences with this kind of thing, or perhaps from anyone who may have seen her?

Thanks

fair question about incall, not all WG have incall available every day despite saying they do incall......one to avoid based on her attitude

Totally over the top response to a reasonable question.

Her loss - move on to the next WL, as there are plenty out there without the attitude.

Reading her nutter replies, they looked very familiar. 

Taking a look back through the messages on my punting phone shows I had a similar conversation with this same lady back in May this year.  So it's not just you.

I think you just saved yourself a hard earned $100!

If that is her attitude on the phone - imagine what a dragon she is in real life

I rang one WL a while ago re details. In the end I couldn't make it that day and replied to that effect with apologies. Next day she texted me and called me a time waster. Every few days after then, she rang on a private number and called me a time waster. I don't have her number and can't even remember her ad. I think it has finally stopped but it indicates the need for a separate phone

She is a nutter ! I too attempted to book her and aborted due to bad attitude. I recall doing some online research and found something about her being a psychic/ clairvoyant ... In any case she sounded like a very inappropriate punt and a psycho scammer...

Her latest ad on sexportal says 'no incall'. I think you just can't win with this one......

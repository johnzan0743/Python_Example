I'm trying to find a cracker/locanto level private for my next punt and it's just so fucked trying to trawl through the frauds. Even a sticky thread of how to reverse google image search would be handy!

Hey dear punters, there is a web service to check photos on the net, it called Tineye.

It doesn't find everything but I have found quite a few that are fake. One punt I even knew they where fake but still went. In real life it was so obvious I got done, she could have put a picture of Elle Mcpherson and the surprise would have been the same.

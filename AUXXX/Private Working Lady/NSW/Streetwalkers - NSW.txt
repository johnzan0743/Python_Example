 Streetwalkers - NSW
				
Post Content: 
A very long time since I approached a street worker - in fact the first time in Sydney - but feeling very randy while walking through yesterday afternoon, saw a beautiful little girl on the corner of Pitt and Liverpool - very discreet, but the look and the glance were there.   Shortish black hair, petite and slim, black top and short black skirt, and Asian (Hong Ko0ng, as it turned out).   I smiled at her and she smiled back, and I said 'Have you been waiting long for me?" and she said 'Too long.'   And off we went.   She had a small flat nearby, with a couch bed in the one large room, which was turned down, ready.   Shower over the bath, which I used, being hot and sticky.  She sat in the loo seat and we talked as I showered, then she held out the towel and helped to dry me off.   She whipped off her top, revealing small nicely shaped breasts, and I knelt down and slid off her skirt and panties; to my delight she was completely shaved.   She turned out to be enthusiastic and agile; pretty much everything was on offer except anal, which I'm not specially into anyway.   She produced a condom early on, which I'd have insisted on anyway.   She was nicely tight, and got pleasantly slippery after a little tongueing of a pretty, small, firm clit.   As we were in missionary and things were warming up, she said 'Please, you come on my boobs?' - haven't had a girl actually ask for that for a long time; I was pleased to oblige, and she seemed delighted.   Dont really understand that, but hey, it was fine my me.   She said she works only on Wednesday and Friday afternoons; she must have another job of some sort, but I didn't ask.   I guess she probably always dfresses in black.   Well worth keeping you eye out for her.

nice find Blatch.  Didnt think these girls worked in the CBD like this.  There are so many hot totties walking around I may get into serious strife if I ask everyone of them if they've been waiting long for me.

What was the coin for such a delightful encounter?

No it's very common that girls work the CBD been going on for years. Even happens at central.

Surprised reviews haven't surfaced earlier.

A lot of young male escorts too. 

If you approach like Blatchford you won't get in any trouble. Because youre actually not propositioning anyone

I walk the CBD every lunch time and can't say I've noticed any WL's but that is probably me. Got any tips on what I should be looking out for?

If you are fat and ugly but she smiles at you, she's a WL.

 Vicki , Streetwalker - Wentworth St, Port Kembla NSW - No contact details
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Vicki


Establishment : Streetwalker - Wentworth st, Port Kembla



Date of Visit : 9 Dec 13



Contact Details/Address/Weblink : n/a



Hours of Business : Aftet Dark



Rates : BJ $50  Full $100



Age : Mid 30s



Size/shape : Blonde, Size 14, Large breasts



Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian



Services Provided : Full service in Car



Value for money/recommend? : YES



My experience/comments : I have always had a fantasy about picking up a streetwalker but had never got around to it.  Guess just the sleaziness of it is sort of a turn on for me.  So on a recent trip to Wollongong I took the opportunity.  I had heard Wentworth st in Port Kembla was their normal haunt so I headed up there for a drive.  At first it was a little disapointed at first, on the first couple of laps of the street there were only 3 girls standing around and only one really caught my eye (other two were definete druggies and looked like skeletons - my sleaziness does have limits) and just as I got the courage up to approach her, another car pulls up and she jumps in. Thwarted I drive a couple of suburbs down for a maccas fix and decide to have one last drive down Wentworth st and then head back to the hotel.  Glad I did.  As I turn into the top end of the street, away from where the others were I see Vicki standing on a corner, and decide to pull up near her.  Shes quiet cute looking and gives me a nice smile, leans in the window and gives me here prices.  I opt for full service and she jumps in and directs me to a quiet place nearby.   We both quickly undress in the car push the seats back and she leans over and gives me some excellent uncovered oral and lets my have a play with her fat titties.  We then manouve into postion for some covered sex.  Although cramped in the car it was fun and managed to get to a few different positions and soon had all the windows fogged up.  She offered to let me finish with CIM, so I jumped at the chance and blew a fat load into hunger mouth which she dutifully swallowed.  All in all I enjoyed the experience and crossed another fantasy off the list.  I would probably go back again but would still be pretty selective about which girls I pick up.

Just a quick idea, I'm pretty sure we have a streetwalkers thread somewhere? These posts might be useful moves there. 

Also, being relatively local, did a quick recon of the carpark yesterday. There are cameras, but not as many as one would usually find at a rail carpark. The exception is the roof, they're everywhere.

I went to huntingwood the other night. Not a single walker in sight...  Wonder if the cops have cleared them out? 

Any other known street walker spots near there they may have relocated to?

Sanjay - I think its more that the older girls that are there have gone now, and most of the younger ones moved on a while ago. Still have the occasional presence but not as much. In terms of police they aren't really any more present than ever before. Less girls hang out opposite the pub since the HWP started being based down the road, but their presence around the creek is no different.

Had an interesting experience tonight, will be doing a review on it tomorrow!

So where are the hot spots in Sydney for street workers, particularly the younger girls. Is the x still a good place?

So decided to cruise through Huntingwood for the first time in a while the other night. Not much out there until I got to the street next to the Sharp building. Turned in to get a closer look and saw a younger looking SW, wearing quite the sexy black outfit with tits that screaming for my attention. Pulled up to her weary that often there is a distance distortion factor, but thankfully upon stopping I saw that she was quite a nice looking woman, and those tits got the little fella already up and running. She was brunette, about a size 16, tits that would be a DD-E cup, and a very nice curves. Personality was very friendly and bubbly, she was a real change from the usual offering out here.

Prices were $50 for BJ and $70 for FS, so accepted and in she got. As she got in I was getting a feeling of her face looking familiar, and as we talked while driving to our spot it was soon revealed why - she had previously worked at a number of brothels in the West, including Midnight Delight where she was known as Emma - one of my all time favourites! She had changed quite a bit since then - at MD she was a size 6-8, puffy tits and was blonde. However, once we got to our spot and the fun began one thing I could see hadn't gone was her wonderful sex drive. She was always an enthusiastic fucker and this was the case still. A great CBJ followed by some wonderful fucking in mish and doggy saw me finish with quite the intense orgasm. More friendly chat as we headed back and all in all a great experience, especially for one with a SW.

She has said she is out there most nights once the sun goes down for about 3 hours. Definitely someone I will be going back for!

The Valley use to be a hotspot up here but now Kangaroo Point & The Docks are big street scene same with Palm Beach down the Coast. Big as in thats where you go if you want some simple easy cheap sex. 
On occasions you will come across a walker head north or south along the coast but I know the legal brothel industry hate street walkers & are starting to hate the online classifieds, they know they getting undercut & one report I read in the CM is they loosing 50% of business to the streets & online trades. Any wonder they up in arms.

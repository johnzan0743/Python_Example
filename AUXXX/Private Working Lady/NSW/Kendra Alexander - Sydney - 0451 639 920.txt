 Kendra Alexander - Sydney - 0451 639 920

I e-mailed Kendra a month or so back looking for a 1hr incall, she mailed me back that she doesn't do incalls and has a 2hr booking minimum at $400 p/hr although Her Privategirls advert clerly states that she does do incalls and there is no reference to a 2hr min booking.

I found some recent reviews from various punters on another site that state Kendra was offering 1hr incalls while on tour in SA. Now she's back in Sydney so I mailed her again on sunday...no reply, mailed her on Monday...no reply, left my name and number on her mobile....still no reply.

Has anyone here booked Kendra in Sydney? She has positive reviews but I object to being told that I HAVE to book for 2hrs with a girl I've never been with before. I prefer to book 1hr and see if we get on and the service is good. If it is I'll see her again. 

She only does outcalls to CBD hotels that she approves of and has a 2hr minimum which means I'd be looking at over $1000 for a girl I've never been with.  

Here's a link to her profile...

Probably left the industry (consensus on another review site).

How long do you reckon they stay in the game before they move on/shut up shop?

My experience/comments : 

it was 40 degrees this day parked on the side street as the house is located on epping road. 
easy discreet access to the house but down the side street there are some construction works going on.

i found their ad off a review here and was going to try "mia? or ruby?" but katie picked up the phone, i said i could be there in 15 minutes and she agreed.
when i got there i was greeted by a nice looking thai girl and thought ok shes not bad, ushered into the room where i said i'd be staying for 30 minutes.

showered, came out great cbj and straight into cowgirl which changed into doggy and after into mish to finish off. still had 5 minutes left and got finished off 
with a pretty decent massage! 

would definitley come back and visit the other girls.
damage, $100 half hour.

No. Google image search answers this fairly quickly. Some of their ads on cracker may have one legit pic. If you take time to sift through them you can see similar backgrounds/walls/curtians and these pictures only appear in image search results for cracker and other advertising sites.

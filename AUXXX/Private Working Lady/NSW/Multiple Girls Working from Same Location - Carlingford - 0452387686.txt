My experience/comments :

So locanto has been okay recently from my experience and this is no different. I have been in contact with this mamasan for 3 visits, the last 2 being Kelly who I will talk about.

The ad itself obviously has fake pictures just as place holders. You can ask the mamasan to send you photos of whoever is working there today.

The apartment is in a fairly good location. Good clean area as far as I know. The ad is mostly true in terms of service, except for rimming you will probably have to tip the first time (not too much so all good) and the second time I didn't have to. But the rest of the services listed are true. All do DFK from what I know, and all do BBBJ too.

I enter the apartment, and I meet a delightfully mature asian woman who I personally find pretty attractive. She's not amazingly hot, but she has a warm reception and a real MILF vibe to her. I walk in, ask for 30 mins, and pay $120. After which I have a shower. Bathroom is fairly neat so not much to complain or talk about there.

Into the bedroom, and off with her clothes and my towel. She starts with a catbath, DFK and eventually a fairly good BBBJ. Eventually I ask about rimming, as I read it in the service list and I am a big fan of it. She says "okay but you tip".

Proceeding with some rimming and she gets more comfortable and decides to slip a finger in for a prostate massage. Now this was the stand out of the whole time I spent with her. Her massaging my prostate as she continued with a BBBJ and an amazing handjob with lots of spit, getting real sloppy and slippery, no lube required lol. This was amazing and was worth the tip in the end for sure.

More prostate massage, DFK, BBBJ and spit and she says to fuck her which I kindly do haha. She also didn't need lube to jump on as I felt, she was already wet. Unfortunately didn't last too long after the prostate play and blew in the dom.

A kiss goodbye with tip left, and I'm on my way.

I've since seen her once more and she didn't want a tip for the same service so I think I'm becoming a bit of a regular.

One thing to note is I think the girls do offer natural sex though I'm not sure how often or if all of them do.

So to sum it up:

Pros:
 - Attractive Japanese MILF
 - Nice BBBJ, lots of spit with HJ
 - Amazing Prostate Play
 - Nice fuck too
 - Fairly good value too

Cons:
 - Might not be working there for long
 - Might be doing natural sex though not sure

Overall I think its worth it. As it's not too pricey for the level of service you're getting which I thought was pretty good. I have also seen a different girl before this one which was a pretty good experience too so don't think you'd go wrong with any of them.

Okay so, it's clear these girls are not medically checked frequently and the mamasan has no intention of doing so. I would advise to refrain from using this advertisers services.


The reason being as I have been in pain and have had a high range fever for a while now due to catching the EBV virus from Kelly (99% sure of this). And although it's not life threatening or chronic, it's still a massive inconvenience as I am unable to go to uni or work for a while.


Steer clear fellas. Will jump back on the train once I recover and start making money again lol

HHV4 is a virus that is in up to 95% of the Adult Population. Epstein Barr Virus is usually symptom free. 

Sounds like you should see your GP as it might be masking something else and self diagnosis is not a good way to determine what is wrong. Especially for a Spy. See your GP before returning to report to M that is all 007...

For those with questions about the EBV it is not the EBola Virus...lol.. TGFT

https://www.science.org.au/curious/p...ein-barr-virus

The link gives some specific and generic information on EBV. To avoid contracting or activating EBV simply avoid kissing is the best way to dodge it. However no guarantee is given.

Lol I found this out from my GP sleazy rider. I don't self diagnose as mostly what you get after googling your symptoms is either cancer or AIDS 

So as soon as symptoms began I went to my GP, and she told me to get multiple different blood tests done after which she confirmed what it was. Nothing too major as the doctor put it. Just a long recovery time and major inconvenience which is why I say to steer clear.

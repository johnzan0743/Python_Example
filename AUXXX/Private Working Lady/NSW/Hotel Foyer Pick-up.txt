My experience/comments : On the way out of a bar this week I glanced at a MILF having a drink on her own....she smiled at me and I winked back.....but could not stop because I was with others and I was due at a dinner.

After dinner and many wines I could not help returning to see if she was still there....and she was!!!....said she was waiting for me.

We had a brief chat where she promises a massage and sex....It was too late for me and I was fairly hammered.....but we agreed that she would come to my hotel the following morning....which she did.

We had a roll around on the bed for a couple of hours and it was great.

Last time I got picked up like this was at the Sydney Casino many years ago.

Are there other hotels or bars in the Sydney or Melbourne CBD where this is a regular occurrence?......very good for the ego and a bit of fun too

Hi David,
You lucky bugger. I have come close but not been so lucky.
A few years ago I was on a flight from Melbourne to Boston which got delayed. While hanging around waiting to board the flight (first time) I got chatting to a woman who was also waiting to board.
Surely enough not long after the airline announced there would be a rather lengthy delay to boarding. At that time I was a club member with the airline so I asked if she would like to join me in the club lounge while we waited to which she agreed.
After two more delays we finally boarded the plane, the lady and I parted and we both set sale (from memory it was meant to be a 7.30am flight and ended up being a 5pm flight...).

By the time we landed in LA it was too late to catch the connecting flight and we were all milling around grumpy with the airline demanding some action. While waiting I again met the lady.
The airline decided to give us some free passes at the local hotel to take a shower and rest up till the next flight and to bus us to and from the hotel which we all eagerly accepted.
Upon arriving at the hotel the woman asked me if I would like to come to her room instead (I was very shocked but quite pleased).
We got to the room and she said to me she would just take a shower to freshen up. Not knowing what to do I thought it best to take a seat and watch some TV until her return.
(I did think about wandering into the bathroom but thought better of it).

She returned and I took my turn to take a shower and freshen up. (She didn't wander in on me either. Buggered if I can read women's thoughts sometimes...)
Anyway I return and she is on the bed so I lay beside her and watch TV. After a while I was holding hands with her and we were chatting away.
Time passes and the next thing you know we are passionately kissing and I'm thinking things are going to proceed well. I reach across and up her top to undo her bra...Â….
The next thing you know it's like someone stuck a cattle prod up her clacker and she's nearly jumped through the ceiling. I shit myself and thought it best to back off.

We readjusted and watched a little more TV before I suggested we head back to the airport to catch the flight.
Again we go to the lounge and have a few drinks and snacks before boarding the plane. We exchange phone numbers and she tells me she lives in Malvern or South Yarra or something like that just before we hit the gate.
She again passionately kisses me and then waves goodbye to catch her flight.
Never heard from her again....
Buggered if I can work out some women!!
Cheers
Jas

So you have written the rate at $300. Was this a paid hookup?

Never had a Foyer pickup but got chatted up at the Supermarket. Helped a Chinese lady pick up her groceries after the handle broke on her basket and got invited for tea at a Coffee Shop nearby. After a pleasant chat and found out her name Feng Mian we went our separate ways. Fortnight later see her again at the Supermarket and get chatting and invites me around for Lunch and she explains to me she is financially independent but had not been with a man for many years and wanted sex. So me and Feng Mian went at it for the afternoon and evening and we still to this day see each other once a fortnight. Didn't expect that under the Red Spot Special at Coles

Interesting to see a WL (or freelancer) at a hotel bar in Sydney. They're much more commonplace at hotels in Asia, especially hotels favoured by Westerners, and there is much to be said for an enthusiastic freelancer doing that work. She can generally 'choose' her customers and the hotel staff don't mind too much if they know the lady is respectable and won't rip off their guests, while the lady herself has only to do a few nights in any week to be making a decent (cash, tax-free) 'wage'. I've enjoyed some memorable romps with hotel bar pick-ups!

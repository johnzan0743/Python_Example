 Barbie Doll - Cairns - 0404 032 822
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Angel

Establishment : Private, based in room at  Rainbow Resort, 179 Sheridan Street

Date of Visit : 7 Nov

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Barbie Doll | Hobart | Escorts & Babes For some reason the link shows as Hobart but this was definitely in Cairns

Hours of Business : 24/7

Rates : $100 for 30mins with HJ

Age : 40+

Size/shape : slim but in no way sexy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Filipino (claimed she was Korean)

Services Provided : massage plus HJ (not that I got that far)

Value for money/recommend? : Definitely not! Keep away as this 'girl' is a total fake!

My experience/comments : 

I was poking around on escorts and babes and curiosity got the better of me.... there was this listing for a 23 year old size 6 girl describing herself as a barbie doll and bikini model. The pics looked hot (though I had no doubt they would be fake) and I decided this girl might be worth a punt. I sent off a text and soon got a reply. I asked where she was from. She said Korea. I thought great. I asked about the price for a 30min massage plus HJ. She responded $100. I then fixed a time to meet. 

I arrived at the appointed time and send her a text. She responded with her room number and I hopped out of my car and proceeded to her room. I found her room and knocked on the door, wondering what type of beauty or beast might answer. Given prior experience of not finding decent WLs in Cairns I wasn't holding my breath in anticipation of something good... the door opened and my worst fears were realised. This was no 23 year old slender Korean hottie with long dark hair and milky skin. Rather this was a rather unattractive 40+ Filipino!

 It took me less than a nano second to decide to say 'no thanks' and turn and walk. Seems some things never change in Cairns... haggard 40+ Asian women pretending to be something that they're definitely not. How these women manage to stay in business is beyond me.

I realise this is not a proper review as I didn't actually end up doing anything with the WL. However, I decided to post as a warning to others to be very careful in the Cairns market and to not hesitate to turn and walk if the person who answers the door is nothing like what is described in the ad or what you were told.

Thank you for your review Rntjimmy.

Strictly speaking this is as you say, not a review, but it is far more credible and helpful than 1,000's of one line comments.

Person's Name : Didn't say

Establishment : Holiday apartment

Date of Visit : June 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Barbie Doll | Hobart | Escorts & Babes  0404032822

Hours of Business : 24 hours

Rates : half hour @120 Hour $200

Age : Late 20's to Early 30's

Size/shape : Short thin

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : Full service

Value for money/recommend? : Very poor

My experience/comments : I went to see this one in early June, although the pictures on E.B. Locanto and goodness knows where else are Fake she described herself accurately and was reasonable (if hard) looking so I went in.

She showed me to the room but refused to discuss the service, just  demanded the $120, telling me "you're not my first customer"; the  dismissiveness and hostility was enough to put me off completely. I told  her she was being too unpleasant so I wasn't  staying, she physically  attacked me as I left. I always leave if I am seriously misled or feel  uncomfortable and have been called all sorts in the past, but have never  been attacked before.

This was my worst experience ever, her attitude was so bad that I am sure had I stayed the experience would have been even worse!

Even though YMMV, it's hard to see a provider after reading reliable negative reviews.

It's pretty clear that punters need to do their homework, refuse
to keep hoping that "next time will be a winner", and subscribe & contribute to a journal like this.

Cairns seems not a good place to punt. Maybe a bit of sex tourism to Bris Vegas or Singapore, 
 Good value double in Singapore ?

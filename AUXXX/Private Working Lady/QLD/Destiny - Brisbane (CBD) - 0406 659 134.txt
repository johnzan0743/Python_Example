Has anyone been to see this lady? Her recent ad on Cracker (cached version here), has four images that are of model Lucy Pinder (verified by google and TinEye). She has a new ad up now with different pics; one is still a picture of Lucy Pinder, but the other three are not, and TinEye reveals no matches for them.

Could these other three pictures actually be the person advertising, or is it best to just stay away, seeing as she's used another person's photos before?

I love the shoes, about 1 size too big - they're not hers. May be its not a model's photo then.

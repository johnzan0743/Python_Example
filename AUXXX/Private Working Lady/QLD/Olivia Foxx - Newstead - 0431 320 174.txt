My experience/comments : 

I've been following Olivia on twitter for a while and I ended up randomly in Brisbane for work and I managed to wrangle a few hours free before having to head to the airport. Booking was a little convoluted but not too difficult.  I was running about 15 mins late but she was completely cool about it after i sent a quick message.  Olivia's place is in a nice part of town in Newstead and I made my way into her nice apartment, and after paying, a quick shower and we got into it.

Photos are accurate, and quite -  smallish breasts, in my eyes great body, round but firm hips and a great butt.

DFK during the session was full on. BBBJ was was really sexy maintaining great eye contact and doing great work with hands and mouth. She slipped the dom with her mouth and some vigourous fucking in several positions (highlight was doggy hanging onto her great hips) along with some daty in between I blew.  Unfortunately as round one went a while I wasn't about to come a second time within the hour.

All in all a great session.  If it wasn't for the fact I don't get to Brisbane often and there seems to be a lot of choice i would visit Olivia again.

Both your reviews have been posted on another Forum - One in Jan, and the other in Feb. They are not a copy and paste but they are essentially the same reviews with the dates changed. I can send you the links if you like?

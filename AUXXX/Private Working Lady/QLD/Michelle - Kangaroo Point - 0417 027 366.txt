Nationality or Ethnicity: Australian (from the bush originally)

Value for money/recommend?: Great value for money and highly recommend.

My experience/comments: I have seen Michelle a number of times for RnT and once for FS adn can say I have thoroughly enjoyed my visits. She is an interesting person and has a lot to say but she is willing to ask lots of questions too. Michelle freely admits she has a limited social life so she likes to get to know her client which makes for a relaxed and more intimate setting. The location is a bit on the seedy side but persevere because VFM is great. Highly recommend for those rainy Brisbane days when getting off in front of the computer screen won't do.

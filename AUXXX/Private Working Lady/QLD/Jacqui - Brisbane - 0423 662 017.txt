I visited Jacqui recently in the early evening. Warner is a little bit of a drive, but place was easy to find. A little fiddly doing the security gate thing, but no real problems. The place is private and discreet.

Jacqui met me at the door wearing lingerie and heels. She is in her 40s, tall and slim, short blond hair with lovely skin and a nice all-over tan.

Had a shower, and a very nice time that did not appear rushed. Jacqui is a good conversationalist and enjoys kissing - a big plus for me.

Why was she good?

The looks and friendliness did it for me. Lots of touching, and not rushed.

Honestly, I don't expect much from Brisbane ladies these days. This is not like Sydney or Melbourne where you can be surprised by a pornstar experience.

So a warm friendly service, from a good looking lady sounds pretty good to me.

Pics don't really do her justice, she looks better than that.

Person's Name : Nina Ti

Establishment : Private

Date of Visit : 25 November 2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0421033493 or 0452190641 / BRISBANE / Cracker WeREscorts.com.au

Hours of Business : 24/7

Rates : $250/HR outcall

Age : 20 something

Size/shape : 5'2" slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : thai but advertises as Japanese

Services Provided : full service (badly and reluctantly)

Value for money/recommend? : no value and definitely not recommended

My experience/comments : Booked this peron after seeing her ad both on Cracker and WeREscorts. Latter ad said she was japanese. Anyway a girl different to the girl in the photos turned up at the door and she was definitely not Japanese. Photos posted on websites I subsequently found out are fakes (thanks tineye.com). Still looked good but expectations broken straight away. Service was poor and even though I booked an hour it was rush rush why haven't you cum yet attitude. 

Half an hour later I am done having a shower she is getting dressed and half out the door on her way to "another appointment". I asked about the rest of my time... she just shrugged me off.

But now the worst part. I am 100% sure I had a $50 note i my pants pocket - change left over from paying her a the beginning. Stupid me left it there right next to her gear on the bedroom floor and I figure whilst I was in the shower she lifted it. As she was rushing out the door I threw my pants back to to see her off etc. Once back inside the door I noticed it missing. Turned the place upside down looking for it but I just know in my mind exactly where it has gone missing - stolen. Its not just the $50 gone but the breach of trust and the massive disrespect.

Yes I should of been more careful with my belongings (even though I am in my own home). Yes its a mugs game and I shouldn't have any expectations or gripes if crap like this goes down on me should I...????? 

Anyway, beware NINA TI on 0421033493 (her pimps #) and 0452190641 (the theif's #) as advertised on Cracker and WeREscorts. 

To the Moderators of this forum I did ring both parties back to advise them of this issue and get an explanation but all I got was an earful and the sharp end of the receiver and I did mention to them I would be going down the path of publicising this if they didn't at least discuss this issue with me. I have also lodged an official complaint with WeREscorts.

Welcome to AUXR FL2000,

Reading the review, it is very wrong for this to occur and happen..

I am sure there are others whom might discuss more concerning this.. It is never a nice feeling when theft is involved and it breaches many barriers and trust..

Had another legit experience at Nucys, so thought I would try one of the PML's who advertise in the Bully. Spotted the above add , it seemed new to me so thought I'd give it a go. When I phoned I could hear a child crying in the background, this didn't particularly worry me so I made the booking. Anyhoo, rocked up to what appeared to be a pretty shabby house with about 4 vehicles parked in the front yard,into the driveway and was greeted by a 40 something guy standing on the patio; he disappeared into the house then Amy came out and let me in: first impression was, not ugly, but definitely no stunner. Proceeded into the house (a bit of a mess) and through to the massage room. The room is somewhat small but not tiny;it was probably an ironing/sewing room as it has a door connecting it to the laundry. She left me to get ready and returned about 3-4 mins later. She started the massage with a lot of squeezing and kneading, I was thinking, I hope this is not what the entire massage is going to consist of.Thankfully she ceased this "loosening"?? treatment and started on the massage with a medium to not quite firm pressure;I wouldn't rave about the massage,but in saying that it's not the worst I've had. She had only been going for about 10-15 mins when she started the treatment on the family jewels and Caybee Jr. She was most proficient at this ,I put up with the enjoyment for about 10 mins then I was up on my knees to get the max out of the tease, after about a minute more in this position she asked if I wanted to turn over,What could I say? It was a YES for me and a YES from Caybee Jr. Her HJ technique was quite pleasurable and I was over the line in a matter of minutes. Cleaned me up and got on with the massage(I still had 30 mins or so left, I booked 1 hr.) Given the way things paned out 30 mins would probably have been enough. 
Would I return? Probably yes but not on a regular basis, the experience isn't that bad and IMHO. i't is value at those prices for all inclusive (HJ only) service. Also she is only about 3 mins by car from home .
By the way she told me she has a 15 yo son and a 2 yo toddler(who she bought into the room to introduce to me , that was something I didn't need).

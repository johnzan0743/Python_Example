My experience/comments : 1st up, message her for phone number, she use to have it up but not no more, not sure what has changed but she is rather quick to reply, her rates are $250 for 30 min & $400 for 60 min, generally outcall only, but this session was done at her place I THINK she lives with her parents, must of been hard up for money as I got her for $320 for the hour....I generally dont pay this for any girl but she seemed fun. When i passed due to simply not having a place & also her rates, she messaged me around 5 yesterday said she can see me in call for a very limited time & reduce Sunday special. So booked for around 730 as was leaving some family from Brisbane heading home.

Arrived, not much for small talk, looks wise, pretty as a peach, sim tight body that looked so nice, ushered into a dark house into her room, almost bumped into everything, paid the dues & onto some limited kissing, pretty boring foreplay, nothing really heated up the whole session, best part was DATY, her puss was so sweet, so nice, spent 25 min eating her pussy, almost no emotion from this girl at all, the odd sigh & very quiet moan, then some covered head, her technique was pretty boring, a problem with young girls it can be, some are great Alexi it seemed her princess persona took over in bed. The sex was again just sex, missionary to start, nothing happening, got her on top, same deal, then doggy to finish. that was it thou it was close on a hour anyways. Up and dressed, she seemed anxious & i left. Get back to the car to realise i only paid her $250 for the hour, I messaged her to let he know will bring the other $70 back & she said no its fine she had fun & thank me for being a gentleman & next time must be out call. Get the feeling she had very limited time before people come home. Advised would not be a next time as i found the service to be very over valued and I guess $250 is a bit of karma lol. She said oh next time I will be alot better. 

Overall: Perfect case of pay big $$$ for a pretty girl dont mean the service is there, I get far better service from girls valued at 1/2 her hourly rates, infact $150 with a lady of very similar looks but the service is a world apart. If you want to fuck a very tight pretty teen & thats it go for it, want a good service give her a miss, especially at her quoted rates. Just another reminder of my $250 ph limit, lucky i guess I only paid that as it turned out. If she was a good fuck I would of booked a few hours with her she is that pretty. 

Rating 1/5 (Looks only)

AS ALWAYS YMMV

Maybe she was worried about someone returning home early and that put her off her game.

However at $400 per hour, I wouldn't be rushing to find out.

Butyl, it looks as if you never rush in to see anyone given you have been a member since Dec 2012 and you last review was in April 2015. I wish to remind you that free membership come with a requirement to post at least FOUR complying reviews a year. You are in serious danger of being dropped to Registered User status.

The forum is only of use if member post their own reviews of their experiences as complying reviews.

Thanks for the reminder.

I had a run in with a friends in blue and had a trip to visit a man with a gavel. Since then I decided to lay low for a while. Due mainly to not have a repeat of that experience and a subsequent inability to feel comfortable visiting any service provider (even legitimate massage businesses make me nervous). I have continued to enjoy punting vicariously through other's reviews and am willing to contribute as I can. 

I have recently attempted to see two wl but on attending there premises found that there were 2 or more girls there I left as I wasn't comfortable in that situation. I figured there wasn't a lot of point reviewing those but will if you think otherwise. I have my eye on another ad or two online and will look to try again in the next few weeks and see how things go from there.

If you need to drop me to a registered member I understand, rules are rules. I'm sure one day I will get over this and get back into it again, and I will then post more reviews, from there I will hopefully qualify to bronze and maintain it appropriately after that.

Maybe paid Bronze membership would be more to your liking as it has no reviewing requirements.  https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/payments.php. Let me know what you decide before I drop you to RU.

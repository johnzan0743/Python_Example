My experience/comments : 
Was a few wks ago so details hazy. Visited in a motel. Was greeted, pleasantly dressed in a pair of shorts. Said she was about to go to the gym (had called and made booking). Reasonably tidy apartment and was led to room at back,  shower, and started off with a massage.

Fairly mechanical service and nothing to write home about as it were. Basic  BJ and some mish with some cow girl when she got tired after 2 min. Finished off in doggie.  Her pic in the advert was prob a few years previously, now sagging, belly, etc. This in itself is not an issue, but the false advertising is.

A lot of chatter and details about how great she is, herself (how she dated a famous swimmer, modelling, getting plastic surgery, blah blah blah) so may not be for everyone. Annoyed me after about 15min and despite gentle attempts to get some quite, did not work. Maybe needed to be a bit more blunt 

Was out of there in about 45min as it was a bit stressful. Will not be back

All in all average experience but YMMV. Guess that's why its a punt.

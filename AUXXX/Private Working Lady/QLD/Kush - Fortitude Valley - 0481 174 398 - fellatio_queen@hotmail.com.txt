 Kush - Fortitude Valley - 0481 174 398 / fellatio_queen@hotmail.com
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name: Kush

Establishment : Private apartment in the valley

Date of Visit: April 2012

Contact Details/Address/Weblink:  Cracker - fellatio_queen@hotmail.com 

Hours of Business:  Not sure what time she starts but usually goes till quite late 10 or 11.

Rates: $100 40min but she mentioned her prices have gone up recently $100/20mins $150/40 mins

Age: Late 20's 

Size/shape: Very small girl 

Nationality or Ethnicity: Kiwi accent but looks more Indian.

Services Provided: Massage with CBJ

Value for money/recommend?: Yes

My experience/comments: I did a search on the forum and it seems no one has done a review on Kush if there is already one around feel free to merge this thread.  I've seen Kush twice now and she was able to take my bookings on short notice.  Parking around her area can be busy so leave yourself 10mins to find a park unless you want to pay $25 at the car park down the road.  Kush is not a stunner but she is easy on the eye and after a quick shower she offers you a massage first up with your choice of powder or moisturiser.  The massage is more swedish light touching and not my preference for a massage but you're not really there for the massage are you.  After about 30 mins you then get a choice of how you want to be for the BJ.  First time I went for lying on my back second time I decided to stand.  What follows then is an enthusiastic blow job with plenty of deep throat action.  She does a bit of ball play also but that was a bit rough and not the sensual slow sucking I would of liked.  Second time I went I actually bypassed the massage and just got the BJ and left.

Both time I've left satisfied and she knows how to swallow you deep when you cum and keeps sucking till you've squeezed out every drop.

 Kush. Fortitude Valley
				
Post Content: 
Recent trip to Brisbane was capped off pleasantly with a visit to see Kush.
First spotted on Cracker I sent an e,mail asking for more detail and decided it was worth a trot.
Booked an hour , cost me $200.

Kush is a slim short  lass, NZ I suspect.  Friendly too. Didnt rush things at all and didnt change the mood with unrelated small talk.

Anyway after the shower  she basically told me that I could change positions any time I wanted. She gobbled for all it was worth on her knees, sitting on the bed, me laying down on the bed, she laying down on the bed and she finished me off  back on her knees and me standing.

I reckon she worked it hard for 45 minutes. good effort and with not one complaint. I did request the "complete" service and wasnt disappointed. Not a drop was spilt..lol

Well worth a visit and Ill be back there next time I am in Brisbane.

That there's the reason I've only seen her once...that and I only found her oral skills so-so....had better elsewhere but different strokes for different folks. Incidentally, is she still next door to Paula in the valley?

 Kush Visit
				
Post Content: 
Better get the quota up I guess.   Saw Kush a little while ago. Took the long version with the oral+. $200

She has been accurately reviewed here before.  A slim girl of Indian? background but from the land of the long white cloud.

I found her to be a very friendly and easy to talk to when she didn't have her mouth engaged. I will more than likely return again when the urge for that type of service hits me at the appropriate time. 

Can recommend if someone is not looking for F.S but energetic oral.

Hours are late morning to around 8pm.

 Kush Blows
				
Post Content: 
Hi all. It's been sometime since I last posted a review. This has been a combination of being more of a lurker on forums like this added to the problem that I have been under more wifely scrutiny, so have been seeing far fewer wls in recent years. There was a time when 50+ new wls per year (added to repeats with faves) was a norm. But not so anymore. Anyway, enough of this lead in rubbish. I saw Kush in Brisbane (the Valley) a little while back and, although she only offers a bj, it's still worth waxing lyrical about. After all, what's better than a bj?

Kush is an Indian/Kiwi (or Fijian, can't recall) and is quite attractive in an exotic sense. She is slender, lovely smooth skin, long brown hair and is very good at what she does.

I have to declare here, I love a good bj (who doesn't) but I rarely, if ever, get off from the bj alone. It's a bit like New Year's Eve: all build up, highly anticipated, but the fireworks are either over too soon, or not spectacular enough.

Kush is not of this category. Watching her take me completely in (I'm not big, but have been told I'm on the larger size) and look up with those big browns, is a memorable sight.

All in all, I enjoyed her company and have been back since. I will go again and the price is right. Recommended.

I have tried to contact Kush over the last 3 to 4 weeks but the old number I had and the number from ozozoz post are not connected. Does anyone know if she is still around? Can someone PM me her  number.

I have seen this chick 3 times now over the last couple of years. One of the best blowjobs around. Was in Brissy the last few days and tried contacting her via 2 phone numbers and her email. No luck sadly. No sign of her ad on cracker either. The other number I tried was 0447 283 694.

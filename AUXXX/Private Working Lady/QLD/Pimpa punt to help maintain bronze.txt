 Pimpa punt to help maintain bronze
				
Post Content: 
Called late night to secure a Pimpa encounter.

Thai girl advertises as 28 and maybe not that far off correct.

Was given the green light for an hour meet in Springhill apartment.

For $200 everything was on offer.

This girl is very accommodating in many ways.

Is no beauty and she  says so herself but I find her attractive and a fun provider.

Not normally a partaker in greek but tried on this occasion after a great oral session followed by covered sex.

She does not bat an eyelid and may even enjoy it .

Won't go there again but another box ticked off. 

Would I return?

Yep

For the oral and full service and company when no rush for waiting clients.

wally, if you want to maintain your free Bronze status you will need to make a complying review using the template which must be fully completed including the link to her advertisement.

Well MDM read it again properly and you will find I will return but I will  leave the trip to Greece out next time.

Mind was never changed.

Just saying.

Give me a heads up with how to get to template my good man or I am only too happy to stick to other forum sites.

Don't see too many QLD reviews here anyway.

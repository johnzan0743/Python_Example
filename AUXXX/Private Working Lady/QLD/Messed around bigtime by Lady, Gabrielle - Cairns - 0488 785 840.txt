Persons name : Gabrielle

Establishment : Private escort

Location : Townsville / on tour in Cairns 9th -13th Dec

Date of visit : 13/12/2014

Contacts : mob 0488785 840 : Escorts and Babes /gabby

Hours : try and contact her but be prepared to be bounced

age : advertised 26

size : 10 D Cup

ethnicicity : caucasian 

Value for money : cost me $ 900 in lost wages for her to not honour my bookings ....

I'd been looking forward to seeing this lady as she looks great in her pics and has some good write ups. When I found out she was coming to Cairns for 4 days I contacted her by text (2 weeks in advance ) and arranged two bookings, first orders she said would 10:30 Monday 9th and then the second booking thu 12th 4pm. I took the morning off on Monday ( lost wages $ 600 ) but could not contact her to confirm our 10:30. Her communication skills are seriously lacking. Finally she contacted me at 12pm saying she couldn't check into her hotel until 2pm. What sort of forward planning is that ? I kept my cool and she said Wednesday was available and we would txt on tue to confirm a time. Guess what,  yes more communication dramas on Tuesday. When I finally got hold of her she said she had accepted a 24 hour booking , whether this was true or not I don't know but she had now ignored my two bookings. I continued to keep my cool and we rearranged thu 4pm and Friday 9am. I kept my texts polite and respectful at all times. Well you know what's going to happen next , more time off & $$$ lost, can't get hold of her. 3 30 she finally communicates, Mr 24 hrs has extended his booking ( over my Booking ). This I know to be bullshit as I called her from another phone and she was happy to take a 6pm. 

    What can we learn from this gentleman ? lady Gabrielle is no lady, and has little integrity or honesty. she's a hardnosed hooker who is happy to take longer bookings ignoring your ' in good faith' existing booking.  If she didn't want to see me just say so, no dramas but why mess me around like that ? An extremely disappointing, expensive and upsetting experience. I'd strongly advise you guys not to waste your time on this woman, save your hard earned dollars for honest and professional operators like Bella Hart or Kayliegh Kross.

Hi fartichoke, I've had a very upsetting and expensive week because of this lady. Punters really need to know about this sort of unprofessional behavior to avoid the same sort of grief i've experienced. I could have made up some sexual activity but this is a completely honest and factual review. It needs to go up in one form or another to stop other prospective customers getting the same unethical treatment. Can we post it some where else or in another format ? I believe the information here is important !

thanks fartichoke. I'll post another review shortly as I've been a busy boy over the past few months. The gabrielle experience was the worst ( attempted ) punt in 2014, be interesting to hear her excuses.

My experience/comments:


After a late night work function, I booked a 15 minute session for $90 with Ruby - this was around 9.30pm. Quick and responsive with text. Arrived at a modern apartment complex in Southbank and was given instructions to her apartment, very good communication thus far.


Was greeted by a short young lady who's a little bigger than her ads, but that wasn't a problem as I was never on the expectation that they will all turn out to be as per photo anyway. Then comes the rules of engagement, no kissing, no touching between the legs, cash up front, rubber not leaving my genital. Respected that safe play is fun play, but still.. Bit of a mood killer when you break it down so mechanically.


As we're getting naked, tried to warm up and start a conversation to break the silence. Nope, cold almost bitchy kinda response with big sigh after every response. How was your day? - Good. Sigh. What time will you finish? - 1am. Sigh. Almost like signalling speed the fuck up (Already going as fast as I can into my birthday suit) and let's get this done and over with. 


Moving along, inspection then she coldly asked, what's next? - decided on bit of boobs play, which was probably the only nice bit that comes out of this session - even then she had to tell me off to be more gentle as they are real... Yes lady, I never expected otherwise and I was already very mindful as I'm aware that I'm not kneading a pizza dough.


What followed was pretty standard, got the deed done, she passed on wet wipes no washroom offered. No effort or whatsoever. Starfish and sour face all the way.


TL;DR: WIR? No. Not asking to be all rainbow, but really, be professional and at least put an attempt in being polite, doesn't cost extra to be nice.

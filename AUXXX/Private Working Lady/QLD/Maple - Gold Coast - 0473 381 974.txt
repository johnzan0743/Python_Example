I'd been following Maple's ads for a while and thought she may be the well reviewed Maple that I never had a chance to see at Utopia.  I eventually found time to call her to make an appointment, which at the time was a little tricky while she was moving house between Mudgeeraba and Surfers/Broadbeach.  Quite a lot seems to be on offer, but I was just played it safe with a Blow n Go booking for starters.  I took a little extra cash in case I got there and felt like more, but that wasn't the case at all.

The house was an absolute dump that smelled like puke.  Pretty obviously a part house with mattresses and beer bottles, cigarette buts etc all over the place.  Maple is a nice friendly lady though - fairly plain to look at, but I reckon she hadn't gotten around to applying any war paint that day, so she could scrub up OK.

The session itself was OK.  I dropped the dacks and sat on a couch while she applied a rubber and went to work.  Ball licking and good technique saw me finished in about 10 mins.  Quick clean up and I was on my way, happy to be out of the pig sty of a house. Hopefully the new place is nicer, as I think with a bit of effort with presentation in general, it could have been a much better punt.

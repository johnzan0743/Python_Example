[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments : Trawling through Locanto the other night and found a girl advertising for late night outcalls to the city and northside so I thought I would take the punt. Easy to organise, few emails back and forth and she attached a pic. Looked ok from the pics so I thought I would give it a shot. Arrived about an hour later. The pic did not reveal that she was a bit of a bigger girl but she still seemed nice so I thought what the hell. Layed down and had plenty of chit chat (not sure if she was trying to soak up time or just wanted to chat) Finally got to it. A fairly unspirited BBBJ with CIM. Assumed there would be a round two as she did mention full service but alas she got up and said she had to be somewhere in 10 mins. She was in and out in about 45 mins with no full service to speak of. She emails back with the name Emily and got the impression she puts an ad up on Locanto when she needs some extra cash. Would not recommend to anyone.

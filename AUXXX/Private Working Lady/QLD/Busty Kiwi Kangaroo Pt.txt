Have you searched the forum for her using her mobile number? That usually shows up any reviews.

Kangaroo Point is a very hit & miss destination
I would be very hesitant until I found more info
Try somewhere better like Cleos on Nile
Just IMHO

Well I suggest you go and see her and write a complying review. I note you last "minimalist review" was in November 2013. See examples of complying review here https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f55/e...t-review-9481/

You should note that free Bronze members must post FOUR complying reviews per year to maintain their free membership, see https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f39/m...ivileges-8318/

My experience/comments : I was visiting Bris overnight and thought a massage would be good so looked online and couldn't really find much, but came across Victoria on Gumtree. Looked genuine but with a possibility of more. Smsed and she replied within the hour so we arranged a time later that night.

Was a private residence. Showed me into her room which was well set up, bed on floor and very comfortable. Victoria was very cute. I arranged an hour which was an A grade sensual massage. Very suggestive in the areas she would touch and had me very aroused. She turned me over and again was very suggestive in brushing my balls. She asked if I wanted to extend in which I said yes thinking that she may suggest something which she DIDNT!! I was enjoying the massage too much to really care TBH. At the end she offered me water and I was on my way.

Afterwards she followed up with some SMS and said that she did offer other services and I should have asked! If she's half as good at extra services as she was at massage it will be amazing. I will be visiting again.

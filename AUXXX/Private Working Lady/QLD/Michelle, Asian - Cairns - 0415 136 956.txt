My experience/comments : 
                                   Looking for a quick cheapie is a challenging activity in Cairns,  Reading through the Cairns Post I made a few calls and decided to risk  it with "Jap Nurse". Almost didn't go as when she gave me the address it  was one I had bailed from previously; she sounded different and I was  ready to bail again if she was not as described, "Tall, slim, 18Yo  Japanese girl", she fitted the description, around 5ft 5 (tall for an Asian girl) and maybe 20 but no older, only  stayed for half hour at $120, excellent value. The only irritation was  she tried to upsell and offered a double for an extra $50, she was a bit  persistent until I told her money was not the issue, I only wanted  to see one girl at a time.

GFE may be a bit of an exaggeration as she made it clear "no tongue  kissing". Started gently, cuddling a slim fairly toned body, she speeded  things up reminding me we only had a half hour (not rushing me though)  covered bj was soon happening, she told me it would be deep and it was  O.K. then a bit more cuddling, finish in mish, all up probably about 20  minutes quality time. No rush to shower asking if I was happy, then  another plug to include her friend next time!

 Not an excellent punt but a good one, especially for the price. This  girl (Said she was called Michelle) told me she would be in Cairns for  another 6 months. Remember this address almost certainly has more than  one girl, if I go again I will still be ready to bail if there is a  switch

Might the said place be the Adobe motel as it seems to have a multitude of 'girls'? I've tried there a few times, with the ones who claim to be Japanese, but on arrival are always Filipino's so I've always bailed (Filipino based on their look and distinct accent (and good English) even though they'll swear black and blue that they're Japanese, lol). The ones I've met have been younger but I definitely wouldn't put them in the 18-20 range (perhaps early 30's). If you've found one that young then you might have found a gem! Might give her a ring and make a booking and see what I find...

Not the Adobe motel, I am familiar with the offerings there and I too have bailed, this was 158 Macleod street (she gave it as 160 on my 1st call, got refined on arrival)

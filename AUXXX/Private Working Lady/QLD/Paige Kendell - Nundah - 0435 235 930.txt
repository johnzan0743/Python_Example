My experience/comments : Paige is a lovely personable lady.  She is very polite and well organised with bookings etc. She works from an apartment at Nundah (Brisbane Northside).  I booked 30 mins with her.  Her apartment is clean and modern.  After a quick shower, she provided a striptease and then was happy to play on the bed.  She's reluctant to "drive" so you need to take charge.  Kissing is Ok but only fish kisses (no tongue).  In terms of the act she will experiment with you but you need to take charge.  CBJ is quite nice and she satisfies in most positions.  Her on top was nice.  

Is not a clock watcher and seemed happy to linger after the event.  Very happy to chat and is quite intelligent.

All in all, not a bad punt but didn't knock my socks off.  Perhaps we just didn't click.

My experience/comments : At first I was a little disappointed. She is certainly not up to the photos on the website. I'd say they are pretty old photos. However it was a good service; she was quite passionate, open and friendly. I had a good time but I'm not sure I would go back.

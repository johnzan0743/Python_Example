My experience/comments: 

Belle has only been advertising the last few months in Rocky. 

She has a nice studio apartment located in the CBD.

Her ad is true to her description and she could easily pass for being younger than 29.
She does sound quite mature for her age on the phone though. 

Offers a shower to begin with then proceeds for give a bit of a soft massage. Time to roll over and a bit more rubbing and teasing with oil. On with the dom and maybe a few seconds of head, which being covered wasn't really a let down anyway, then her on top which she seems to enjoy. This lasted a fair while as, like I said, must have felt enjoyable for her. Then onto doggy, with her glorious arse spread in front of me. Wasn't long before I filled the rubber. 

A bit of a chat then said our goodbyes.

Although the CBJ is far from outstanding, her looks and friendliness alone are easily worth the $150. She offers a nice soft massage and hj also for $150.

Finda is an online version of the classifieds you find in local papers. Use to be localclassifieds.com.au. Keep in mind though that they won't list all the ads you will find in the paper. I'm guessing it's an option for the advertiser to have them listed online. I have noticed however some girls only ever list their ad online though.

Value for money/recommend?: Not so good. A bit rushed, mechanical. Would be great if you clicked with her.

My experience/comments:

I've only just started out in the review scene (first time review, long time reader as they say). Anyway, Brazillians [sic], gotta love big butts. This one is no exception. She has the classic bubble butt look going on. Not too big, just about right.

Unfortunately, don't know what it is about this girl. Has all the right features but always seems to fall short. I've seen her twice in Toowoomba. I think she also goes up north Qld as well. On the phone she is really friendly, has a nice accent (says she is from Sao Paulo) and charged $150/$250 (30/60 mins) for full service back in March 2012. This went up to $200 for half an hour when I went back on Christmas Eve 2013. Might have been public holiday surcharge. I would say $150 is more fair. On both ocassions she is pushing me out the door in under 20 mins. No kissing, no this, no that (EXTRA!)... 

She normally rubs you down with her oily chest to get started, which is nice. She has the body for a good body slide, but also the attitude to kill the mood unfortunately. Not that she is rude, but I had a hard time on both occasions fighting for her attention versus her phone. She said she had regulars contacting her. I can imagine if you clicked with this one, she would be great. But I think the cold starfish treatment I've got on both occasions is a deal breaker. Would be interested in anyone elses experiences as well. 

Cheers

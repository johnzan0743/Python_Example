My experience/comments : Saw nicole in early January, she's been coming to town every couple of weeks since then. Booking was simple via text, but she was staying at a cabin kn a caravan park which wasnt really nice - she said she wad going to transfer to a hotel which should be better.

Pics are real, recent, but very myspace angle, so she's quite a bit chubbier than she looks. Anyway, came in, had a shower, and onto the bed for the massage - now I was her second client ever, so she wasnt super organised, she didnt have a towel down on the bed, and she was using a lot of lotion. However the massage was pretty decent, not sexy, but functional. Onto the flip, and no teasing but straight for the tackle for a functional but not amazing hand job. Touching was allowed, and she had amazing tits.

Finished off, and she had to get toilet paper to clean me up (I suggested she get a supply of baby wipes by the bed for the future), a quick shower to get all the lotion off, then out the door. Time was about half an hour plus the showers.

So, was it good value? $100 for an half hr massage buy an australian up here is probably a yes. Would I return? I would probably give her another shot to see if she's i proved, because she was keen, and very new, and I think there is potential there.

My experience/comments:

Hi all here is my first review on this site. Now to start things off, I made a booking at 2:45pm today. I show up to the place and ring the bell, wait about 3 minutes for her. 2 minutes after I've rung the bell, another guy opens the gate to the place. So first off, 2 punters have run into each other, the one thing you never want. Well I just tell him, I made a booking and he just leaves. At this point we've seen Coco.

Now Coco advertises as a 23 year old chinese babe. She's not 23, she doesn't sound nor look 23. This I actually picked up on the phone, but I was hoping for a nice massage. So I still went and paid the $70. So went in and hopped on the bed and got the massage. Let me just say, it's a shit massage. All she did was rub her hands on my back and legs and did a few chops.

During the massage, she grabbed her phone and made a phone call, trying to massage me with 1 hand. Okay, I can understand someone calling you and you answer, but she literally grabbed her phone, dialed a number and made a call. So I'm asked to turn over, which I do. Guess how long it's been, less than 10 minutes! She then goes to work, and not a bad technique, not great, but not bad. Afterwards, she asks if I want a shower, which I do to try and get some oil off.

After the shower and I get changed, it's only been 15 minutes! I paid $70 for a 10 minute massage. She offers me a drink, water or coke afterwards and I leave.

All in all, I wont be going back. The massage wasn't great, the handy wasn't bad, but for the time and money, not worth it. No idea what she's like for full service. And if the guy I happened to run into is on this forum, hopefully I got you to dodge one.

Concerning the pictures, I can confirm the room, that's it, no idea if she's the girl in it, probably not and also she has a tattoo on her stomach, for anyone that might recognize her.

I can understand it when a punter doesnt remember the name of the WL (in a brothel) that provided a very ordinary experience, but when a punter is spending money with a Private WL, the amount of premeditated planning should ensure that he remembers her name in order to follow through with the booking.  In this case the Punter is recalling a punt that was 6 weeks ago, so maybe he can be excused.

How can we know this BAD review is genuine, how do we know that it isnt really designed to kill off business for Newmarket Delight?  

How many reviews has this punter made?

Hi HBL,

Your are right, right in that I cannot absolutely guarantee that PMM is 100% correct in every detail, the same way I am not 100% in every detail of every post in the forum.

The reality is that we do a reasonably good process of verifying Establishments, we have our ways, the same with girls that are active in this and other forums, and a fair process with girls have been reviewed before .

The weak link and you have identified this, is new private girls, there are so many sources of names that it is very difficult to confirm all the details, so we do what you have done, we read the review, does not makes sense, there may be some questions, and believe me I do ask.  I have an in box of PM's full of responses and obviously an even fuller out box.

In the end it is a judgement, and it is a value judgement, I made the call the PMM's review was good enough, time will tell if he is going to remain good enough.

I have "de bronzed" people too, if an issue becomes apparent, we can make changes.

I prefer to trust people where I can.

If you wish to toftt and call "Katie, I think" we can sort it out.

I am very thankful for your interest, I know you want to keep all the reviews as the highest quality possible, and I want that too.  Together we will definitely improve the forum, thanks for the interest.

Cheers



Chalk

Chalk, I think at $300 ph there will not be a rush of guys to her door to toftt !!
I think, however, pmm should have been asked to provide more comment for his allegations and to be worthy of bronze membership.

I'll take this feedback onboard and be a bit more "stricter" in the standards.

Cheers

 I have posted this non-event as the deception in Cairns is getting  devious. This time my call was answered by an Australian girl and all  sounded right, I called again on arrival, same Aussie accent told me the  room number (room 4 at 141 Lake street).

 When I got there instead of  the 5ft5 Aussie girl of 19 years the door was opened by a late  20's/early 30's Asian, about 5ft tall, not unattractive, but nothing  like her pictures and Instead of the Aussie accent, that assured me we  would be able to communicate I was greeted with "Ahlaw Dahling" As  always when this happens I politely explained why I was not staying.

The new twist here is getting a girl with an Aussie accent to answer  all the calls, I am guessing that several Asian girls in the same complex are working with one Aussie. I usually screen out any girl with poor English as the result is  not going to be good, this time I got conned into a wasted trip

To help make this review more informative I called  again from a different number and asked the question "you sound  Australian are you?" The reply was "no, I'm Thai/Russian", still in the  pure Aussie accent. I wonder how long before even that direct a question  gets a lie in response!

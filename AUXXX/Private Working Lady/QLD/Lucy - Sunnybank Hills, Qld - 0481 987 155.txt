?? Sexy Physio on holiday~ Really need a good relaxation can call me ?? - Brisbane escorts - backpage.com.au

Not a qualifying review for membership status, but just a help to other punters to avoid what I went through.

This particular worker is not a physio, is not the girl in her photos, and doesn't have DD or E-sized boobs.

She told me her address and said she was available at that time. I went over and parked in the middle of a townhouse complex. She said she'd be a few min. I said no problem.

30 min later I messaged her. Few min is OK, 1/2 hr is pushing it. Then I departed. She replied, said she had just arrived home. I was 300 m up the road, chucked a U-ie for a chance to check out this alleged physio. Sat in the carpark for 15 more min while she stalled me.

Finally gave me the apartment number. It was adjacent to where I'd parked. 30 seconds later I was on my way to the Valley to visit Emma, who turned out to be hotter than Lucy.

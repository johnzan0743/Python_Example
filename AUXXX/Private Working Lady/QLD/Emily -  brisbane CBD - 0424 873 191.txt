My experience/comments : Somehow i managed to get sucked in by one of those fake cheap asian ads. Not the girl in the pics but still young and attractive. I showed her the ad on my phone to confirm she did what the ad stated and she was sketchy in response, but i went with 30 mins. She was extremely clinical, uncooperative, wouldnt do anything i asked had to be her way with everything, and kept squeezing the old fella too tight and digging her nails in. Because of her shit attitude i had trouble getting a stiffy. Even refused to give me a massage. After 10 minutes she leaves the room gets dressed and says we cant do it and makes excuses, wouldnt give any refund.

The ad did say 100% real pics or walk away. Should have.

I've done it 3 times. The second time, I handed over the cash, while showering I decided I wasn't going to put up with this BS. Got out, asked for refund, she kept $30 for shower time. She said, if you don't want to lose money, don't come in.

After the 3rd time, I learned to do my research better. Real pics or I'm not coming.

Now I ever get homeless, I know how to get a nice shower for $30.

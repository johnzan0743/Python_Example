Person's Name : Willow

Establishment : Her hotel

Date of Visit : December 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :  Willow Private Brisbane Escort Willow | | Escorts & Babes 
0497554486

Hours of Business : Most times available

Rates : $350 to Ridiculous

Age : 30

Size/shape : about  a 12 but flabby

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian

Services Provided : Full service

Value for money/recommend? : Poor value

My experience/comments :   Willow advertised ahead of a cairns tour, from Brisbane, I liked the pics and description so called to pre-book on trying to  discuss what the advertised $350 included, she told me that $350 was the Brisbane price and Cairns would be $450; That ended the conversation.

  The day before she was due to leave I noticed the price was back down to $350 so called, agreed a service and booked.

  On arrival I was a bit disappointed, the high class babe in the pictures was not who opened the door, I should have bailed then on principle of being misled, but didn’t, the girl was passable (full description below) and confirmed the service agreed sex oral both ways and kissing with gentle tongue . At privateGirls rates ($600+) no way would I have stayed but we were talking EB rates and there is a drought of non-Asian escorts in Cairns at the moment.

  I paid and took the requisite shower, when I came out she was drinking a glass of red wine and it was clearly not her first!
  Started well, a bit of kissing and cuddling (not passionate or any tongue) then she started stroking me down below, even though I asked her not to yet as I wanted more kissing and cuddling first.

  I stopped that by going down on her, but she kept giggling and moving away, saying I was tickling her, eventually I gave up. I tried to lay us on our sides and cuddle, she got up spent ages at the fridge pouring herself a mixer, my erection  softened!

  She started hand work again and did manage a bit of a stiffening, I specifically explained “It is closeness that will get it hard” and went to kiss her, she kissed, but not as agreed. By now it was clear that the service described was a misleading as the pictures and I had found another bad punt.

  She clearly wanted to just get things over with so we went  for her on top cowgirl first, she did coax another erection and rode it, but mechanically. Then she must have got tired and said “new position?” and we ended up going to completion in missionary. 
  This was only after a half hour, and she asked if I wanted to shower, I didn’t and asked her for cuddling and kissing for the time left, she readily agreed then went to her phone for around 5 minutes (ignoring me).

 After that no physical contact was offered so I asked her to sit on my lap, she did, but kissing was made difficult and she started to tell me about her next client who had just messaged her to say he would be there in 8 minutes. This was about 45 minutes into a one hour booking and marked the point where I gave up, showered and left. 

Physical description

  Willow makes a lot of her Dancer physique but it isn’t there, her legs and butt are not the ones in the pictures. In reality she has flabby, soft thighs and butt, nothing like those of the professional Dancer she pretends to be. She is about 5ft 6, variously states 5ft 8 or 9, I’m 5ft 7 and she is shorter than me.

  She is not fat, and there are remnants of muscle tone, I didn’t ask why but she has no belly button, my guess is an infected piercing and some surgery.

  Looks wise, the high cheek bones etc don’t exist, eyes are brown not green, smile is not special (or frequent) forget all the hype, Willow is an average girl, and not worth more than Asian rates, $120 quickie would be all I would go back for, and even then I might try a new Asian first.

  Summary,
  Money down the drain, mis-described, fake pics, service agreed and confirmed on meeting not delivered.

Thank you for your review joculese.

A good, cool-headed, report of a disappointing service.

Reports such as this are valuable, and a good model for new
members on how to react when it turns to custard.

That sucks man. Escortsandbabes claims photos verified. Claiming sz 8 and receiving a flabby sz 12. Wow. 

Thanks for the review.

Thanks for the informative review. Need to be soooo careful in Cairns. The pics look pretty good so really bad that they're quite misleading. And it seems that price is often not a good predictor of quality.

Not trying to stir. But I think this should be mentioned. Came across this on private girls on willows profile. 



...9 December 2015...

I am more than aware of FALSE reviews that get sent in about Escorts and it seems I have fallen victim to this as well.

This morning I met with a staff member of Privategirls to confirm that I AM the person in the photos on this profile. I now have Gold Verified status. Please click on the link above to see what this entails.

Negative and false reviews have the power to destroy ones reputation and basically ruin an otherwise beautiful day. I know the truth and I am not going to give anymore air time to this situation. Thank you to those special clients who have encouraged me to post this message

I see no reason to doubt the essence of joculese's review.

He paid and then reported the experience lucidly and coolly.

Mmm. Well as I said not trying to stir anything. The review seems as real as it can be. I'm with you here. 

The privategirls verification system is where I am getting lost. I mean I know a bit of Photoshop exists but the review states a description different to the photos. Anyway. Just thought I would bring light on what I found. There can be two sides to a story...

I can help out here, Firstly, she would say that wouldn't she! 
But more substantively I sent a copy of my review to PG (Shelly) and after a few emails it is now becoming clear that "Willow" is not who you will necessarily get to see, the PG Five star verification includes a commitment to be the girl, who presents and to provide the service described; neither of these requirements were met.
Now I would say that "Willow" is real but works with other girls under the same Ad. You can't be sure who you will end up seeing when the door opens, with all the difficulty that presents in walking away! Whatever the set up, it is not open and clear so in my opinion best avoided. I have lost a bit of faith in the PG verification system during the exchange of emails. Advertising sites are not as unbiased and Frank as review sites, PG told me "As an advertising site we do not publish negative reviews" How biased is that!

Are you confirming that PG (Shelly) knows that there are one or other girls working under the perception that they are willow? Or are you assuming this to be the case?

If PG is as biased as you say.. Then could be that you did see the willow (the one and only) and the ad is just a straight up fake. Or a case of very good photoshop?

I find it hard to believe that other girls are working as her, when it's only the one number and with such a descriptive profile it seems pretty stupid to have one or other girls pretending to be you, espically in circumstances like this.

In answer to Milkyjoe, PG (Shelly) carefully told me nothing I didn't already know, plenty of bluster and a little bit of flannel, enough for me to get the feeling that PG don't really care what is going on as long as they get their revenue and keep their hands clean. I do not know if the photos are seriously doctored or if the girl was swapped. 
I am going to move on from this now, hopefully my next review will be of a better experience.

A quick word from our sponsors here.

Well said, joculese, and a reminder to members that while AuXXX accepts paying advertisers, there is nothing more in the editorial policy than that providers should be treated respectfully and fairly. There is none of the "pay for play" of the radio charts.

Without reviews that are informative and fair, the outcomes favour the players who can lie without fear of 
consequences.

The forum acknowledges the work involved in preparing such reviews and the commitment to useful reviews that contributors
demonstrate.

On the other hand, those  who fail to review will be detected eventually, asked to fulfill their commitments and ejected when they don't.

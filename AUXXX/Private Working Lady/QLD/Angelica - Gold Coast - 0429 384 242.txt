Hi Guys.

This is a repost of something I put on AE a while ago. Posting it as a bit of a warning against playing the Gold Coast Bulletin Roulette rather than using reviews to pick ladies!

Even though I say this is GCB Roulette, I've actually had my eye on this girl for a while. When I rang her the first time a couple of weeks ago, her "spiel" included mentioning a service that I really like (but can't mention here), but by the time I tried to ring back to book I couldn't get a time, so I only got to see her recently.

Apart from the "service", she suggests a pretty standard set of prices, with $80 for massage, $100 for oral and $150 for full service. I took the $100 for oral service. She describes herself on the phone as an ex-model that is very glamorous with a size-D bust, but I noted on the phone that she conveniently forgets to mention her age. She works out of one of the high-rises in Broadbeach.

So, can you guess what happened? I rock up at the apartment, knock on the door and am greeted by a woman that's old enough to be my grandmother! Scary look about her and the only reason she is blond is certainly because she dyes it! But, being the trooper I am (and driven by Little Mike again!), I commit to coming in and pay my $100 and take my shower.

To be fair, she starts with a massage and it's actually pretty good. It's not really a sensual massage, but she warms the oil first and does a good job rubbing at just the right level, and all over the body as well. After about 10 minutes she asks me to turn over and then starts playing with it, providing a nice handjob followed by a few sucks. However, this is where it starts to suck (pun intended).

Rather than continuing with the oral service, she then shifts back to the handjob and starts to jerk with all her might, asking me "how I'm going?" and if "I'm close". Just when I think she might be going back to the sucking, she decides to apply some oil to make it "feel better" and I realise that her gameplan now is to make me come as quickly as possible. I lie back and oblige and then, just like my previous GCB encounter, she cleans up and then asks me if I want to take a shower. I agree and to her credit, she offers to wash my back before I get dressed and get out of there.

So, what happened? Well, the biggest problem (apart from the age) was the fact that it just wasn't sexy. The massage was good, but not sexy, the oral was good, but not sexy, and the stuff at the end wasn't sexy either. I kind of got what I wanted, but I don't think I'll go back again.

Things like this is the reason I'm wary of the bully roulette and I've had my share of shockers. Funny how you can never just say "no" and walk away when you're in that first meeting and the frisky bit of your brain is uncontrollable.

I Couldn't agree more with this review, I saw this lady for an RnT about 6 months or so ago, and possibly had the worst experience possible, paid for half an hour, but by the time i was done, and had a shower, only 20 minutes had passed. Very disappointed and the body is saggy, and plain right old. It's a shame there are no laws dealing with consumer protection for these girls.

That's what reviews are for, to encourage the good and dis the bad.

It would be better to walk when you know in the first 60 seconds or so that it's not going to end well, but one always hopes.

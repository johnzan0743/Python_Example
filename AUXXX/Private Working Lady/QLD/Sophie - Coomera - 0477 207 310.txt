Services Provided : full service also massage

Value for money/recommend? : I enjoyed it 

My experience/comments : Last week was on the northern Gold Coast, having coffee with the Gold Coast bully in my hand, thought it was time to take a punt and during the scan of the paper I spied Sophie's non descipt ad and made the call.
she had time within the hour which worked well for me, as I had a bit of time to kill between appointments so I rock up at her place east of the Coomera rail station, in one of the newer estates and was greeted by a hot chick in lingerie, smoking body and a pretty face.
as soon as I saw her I thought I need more than the massage service here, so chose the half hour service which included some massage body slides, good oral and doggie finishing in missionary, all of which was more than satisfactory, it was very good indeed, more gfe than pornstar but a very sexy lady, and a worthwhile gem, that seems to be I reviewed.

as always beauty is in the eyes of the beholder and your experience may differ from mine, but I reckon this lady gives good value for the Gold Coast!

Just confirming gcme's post...the phone number does in fact relate to a now overpriced massage girl living off the broad water. 

Peace

I am so sorry, I gave the wrong number, the correct number is 0477 207 310. I had rang that other number earlier and passed on her service. Could the mods please fix this as I am unsure of how to edit the phone number.  Sorry for any inconvenience caused to any of my fellow punters!

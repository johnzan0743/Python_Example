My experience/comments : Saw ad in Bully so thought try as Japanese on shopping list. Ad in relaxation section and on enquiring was quote 70 sensual massage and 100 FS straight out so went with an open mind. English good and on arriving saw a taller than expected average sized young lady and took the FS option. She was not the petite japanese girl i expected but pleasant and straight into action. She was keen to please and reconned 1st day from Japan and here for 3 weeks ?. Everything was on the table without hesitation and only criticism was she kept pulling back when getting in too deep or hard. No rush and it seems this address may recycle the girls thru on a regular basis and doubt she just arrived but more likely on tour. I wont return for her but she was ok.

Sometimes seems to be the case... Chinese masquerading as Japanese because they are perceived as 'premium' girls. And some Chinese girls can look quite gorgeous and very similar to a Japanese. Start chatting a little to the girl about Japan and it should be fairly obvious if she is really Japanese in terms of how she engages. Though if her English is pretty crappy that could be a problem!

My experience/comments:

Boredom on friday nights can lead to cracker!  Well here is the summary:
	* Initial contact with a non-chinese sounding woman
	* The girl messaged me with her address
	* The appartment was neat, girl was pleasantly dressed and had quite a lot of lipstick
	* She looked average and okay for a change
	* Got to the bedroom, she kissed and hugged me, asked me for the money
	* What the heck, I said 1 hour and gave her the money!
	* Then it all went downhill, she asked me to underss, and while she was talking the phone
	* She started to undress, she had a bad scar below her stomach (made me change my mind, told her i just need a handjob and massage)
	* She took me to the shower, and gave me a cleaning.
	* She started giving me a handjob (too much sanitizer)
	* And she was constantly receiving and sending/making texts and phone calls
	* She was a big turn off, i was fed up asked her to give me a massage instead
	* she started giving me a massage that was half-decent, but was hitting all the wrong spots 
	* 35 mins since i walked in the door, she gets a phone call, and looks at me and we are done.
	* She is like that is 40 mins, I cant give you money back. (it seemed as if she had some one else coming)
	* She was in a rush to get me out, i took a shower and she was fetching my shoes etc. 
	* Over-all AVOID!!

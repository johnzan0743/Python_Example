My experience/comments: Advertises in gold coast bulletin. Originally called about a massage - you need to go to the apartment, call and ask for room number and she will buzz you up.  My first impression upon seeing Anuskha was that she was a little masculine, which concerned me a bit. Just something about her frame bothered me, but i pressed on anyway. She told me she was and Indian classical dancer over from Perth to earn some cash.

 Anuskha took me straight to the bedroom of a run down block of holiday flats, and immediately undressed.  She has Indian style nose piercings and I think her belly button was pierced as well. She asked me if I wanted full service or not and she gave me the prices. I hadn't had an Indian girl before so temptation got the better of me, so I chose full service. Started with some light playing and sucking on her tits, then she put a condom on and gave a poor blow job for a few minutes.  She climbed on top for a few seconds then asked me to fuck her doggy style (which I don't enjoy).  10-15 minutes back and forth between doggy and mish then she asked me to finish up. Didnt allow me to touch her (unshaven) snatch as it was too 'sensitive'. I was in and out in 25 minutes. 

She told me she was staying on the gold coast for another week before trying her luck in Sydney, but the apartment and kitchen seemed to be set up like she was going to be here longer. 

I wouldnt recommend her as I am sure there is better value and a more enjoyable experience out there. Oh and try as I might I can't get the smell of her dirty cheap perfume off me, despite scrubbing and scrubbing!

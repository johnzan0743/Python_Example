My experience/comments : 

I have been to see this girl a few times and she has pretty good prices for Brisbane. $40 - $50 for a 30 minute massage, depending on her mood i guess.  She is always friendly, however more often than not she will take calls while she is massaging, or giving you a blowjob, which can be a bit distracting.  She's definitely not 24, and is stocky and plump.

My experience/comments : After ringing around some MLs in the cbd without luck got a text back from this chick. Made a booking around lunch time and headed to some hotel in the city. Given the floor and unit number I was greeted by a fairly mature korean lady. If your sensitive to red light then give this a miss cos the whole unit was a bright red due to the red globe she has in the room, gives a new meaning to red light district.  Paid her the pineapple and got nude. Now she uses a towel on your body for the massage so no cream or oil is used. Massage was way too hard and at one time she stood on my back with her feet which crack my back which I told her to stop. On the turn she put the rubber on for some CBJ, was allowed to touch her ass and play with her nice C cup  tits. Blow my load and cleaned up. Not very talkative and was texting and taking phone calls from clients.

if I do go back I would only ask for the blow n go, definitely give the massage a big miss.

My experience/comments :
Personally, this was the worst punt I’ve ever experienced. I felt dirty after the session and definitely not in the good kind of dirty. Upon reading the previous reviews on her, I thought maybe she had potential, perhaps a mediocre session at worst. How very wrong I was. I’ll start with the overall session: total shit with her having strong hands but zero technique. She didn’t know what she was doing but just kept on pouring on the pressure. Another issue I had was that she didn’t listen to continued feedback to ease up on her “massage”. It was as if she was in her own little world. This then lead me to the other gripe: she was texting during the whole session. The previous reviews made it seem like not much of a big deal but that’s all she did to the point of not even massaging my other leg. It’s as if she wasn’t even trying to do her job. Total space case. The other issue I had was her workplace: it’s a fucking disgusting shit-hole. She works from a hotel/holiday apartment and I pity the cleaners who’ll have to deal with all that mess later. I think all the red lighting was meant to hide the mess but you would have to be blind to not notice it. The place reeked of smokes with laundry scattered all over the place. It hadn’t been vacuumed in a long time and you could see chunky bits of dirt! The less said about the shower and basin the better I think but I still ended up using itas her bed too seemed filthy. All in all, a very shitty experience and the only thing I found borderline passable was CBJ and relief of finally getting out of that place. Even some of the dodgy Sydney parlours aren’t this bad. Not recommended and I’m going back to my massage parlour regs.

Nalia is the name fellas.

Tried her a couple of years ago. Massage was a killer.

Like foolish said..... she would not take a hint about massage being too hard to the point of painful.

I went for full service........actually willed myself to orgasm to get out of the joint.

Told her on exiting that it was the worst service I had ever experienced.

Got a blank look!!!!!! Never again

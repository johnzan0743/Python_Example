My experience/comments : Found myself on the GC without the ball and chain and with lead in the pencil, so looked up Backpage. 1st mistake.

Got in touch with this woman, who assured me that she was the woman in the pics on the advert. She wasn't. I actually walked, but when I couldn't find another alternative that was so convenient (she was literally 2 mins walk from my hotel), I went back. 2nd mistake.

She was pleasant enough, but nowhere near the hottie that is pictured in the ad. She tried to finish me off with a handie, but I cut her off. She pulled every swifty she could think of. I think she is one of those women that goes from town to town, scamming poor schmucks like me. I was already super-suss about this woman so I only forked over for 20 mins ($100). Was quizzed 'why only 20 minutes darling?'. Maybe coz she is a lying scammer? Anyway she did a variation on cowgirl for all of 15 seconds, before insisting on doggie. In short, don't waste your time with this one. I was so loaded that I didn't last long in doggie, even though I wasn't particularly excited. She served a purpose, barely. I was going to need another punt to get over this one, so I headed back to Sydney the following day and swung by 64 Alexander. That review to follow tomorrow.

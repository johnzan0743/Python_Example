Value for money/recommend? : Yes, but we didn't click

My experience/comments : Been out of the game for a bit, and I've seen Kat's ads for a few years touring in Rocky, never went to see her. Well last month I fancied a bit of something, I saw her tits on her ad and thought, yeah alright. Set up was easy - texted her on the day and got a lunchtime appointment for a rub n tug. Went to her hotel room, and photos were real and recent enough to be representative of who she was, was offered a shower and given exactly what she described-
A massageA body slideA toy showA (covered) bjHand relief

And it was all good, but it very much felt well practiced and as if she was following a script. Also, no front massage or slide, which is disappointing.

So, good value, attractive, but would I return? Probably not, it was just okay for me. I kind of feel though that if we'd clicked it would have been better, or maybe I wasn't in a great mood - I dunno, it just wasn't quite as great as I'd hoped.

there was a massage followed by a body slide, I was disappointed that this was confined just to my back, she then out on a short toy show, then gave me a covered blow job, then finished me off by hand. I felt the service was fine but seemed overly practised like she was following a script. She was nice but we really click, and i left a little disappointed with the experience.

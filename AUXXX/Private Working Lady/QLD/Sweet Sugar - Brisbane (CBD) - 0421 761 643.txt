I have to report that Brisbane - Sugar Babe ( 0421 761 643) sweet cute shy Sugar Babe (not Sugar Lee) tried to rip me off in a scam for $9500. In this rip off she claimed to be retiring, closing down her sites as they were in Aug/Sept and would need $9500 to see her through.  She did not even try to say it was a loan, just payments to be made to her. The whole scam relied on you trusting her, feeling sorry for her and liking her, just what a scam relies on.
When it was apparent that the money was not going to be paid that easily she quickly dropped me like a hot potato, her website returned and advertised again, she stopped returning my calls and SMS.. She refused to see me on previous confirmed dates, or offer compensation, or reschedule for new times.  On the one occasion she called back later shouting in the phone that she needed the money straight away (or else).
I have given Sugar  Babe 3 months to talk with me,  and I have spent another $2400 trying in vain to allow sugar to discuss this person to person.  I am not spending anymore money to give her the opportunity to speak again with me at her apartment. Her attitude is clear. Believe me when I say I get NO pleasure letting everyone know. Today, I would have preferred to have paid the $9500 and be done with it, but I was just being cautious back then. But in the interest of all concerned I note her website is "closed again", and it may still be going on.

Tigaboner, by the wrath of St Joseph's staff that is a negative report on Sugar. I can't follow your logic at all, do you mean you paid her $9500 to be exclusive to you, then spend another $2400 just try to talk to you? It really doesn't make a lot of sense to me unless you are totally insane.  I sent you a PM on Friday to help me understand your perspective but there was no response so I felt compelled to write regarding this as I feel you are damaging a lovely girl's reputation and business by what you are doing.
Sugar is one of the very nicest ladies I have had the pleasure of spending time with and the scenario you paint does not seem either like her or realistic, to be honest it sounds like you are holding a grudge for some reason.

Not asking you to take anything back, simply asking you to clarify your story as I simply can't understand it. You paid her how much and for what? 
The usual deal is you turn up, pay a lady some money, you do your thing and you leave - not that complicated. In your story after she asks you for $9500 that I assume you don't pay you then you give her $2400 trying to get her to talk to you face to face. What? I can't make head nor tail of it.
Presumably to you posted to warn fellow punters of Sugar doing unethical things so help us to understand otherwise it seems like you have an issue with her and looking to punish her because she doesn't want to see you any longer.

I'm with halfclover, tigaboner what exactly transpired? How did you spend "another $2400" trying to talk to her?

I've never seen Sugar, probably never will, but I'd like to understand what was requested and what actually happened.

At the moment your post doesn't make a whole lot of sense, at least not to me.

Nor me. 

More details and less cryptic bs.

Otherwise, suck it up and move on.

OK, well I jumped in yesterday at very short notice and tried this lady I have been aware of for sometime from her http://www.australian-babe.com/babes/natasha web site.

Overall, quite disappointing. We certainly did not click and this would be one of very few I have not clicked with. It started fine, with easy contact via phone, locking in a time in the very near future and being met at the door by a mature woman presenting a very nice package.

From there it went downhill rapidly. I was definitely after the GENUINE GFE as advertised, however, don't touch the hair, no DFK, rapid waving light hand massage, always trying the tug in foreplay, lying back eyes wide open and totally vacant in DATY, please stay on the towel in the middle of the bed, oh no we dripped on the bed spread and either totally not interested, or, I felt thinking about anything and everything else to move on to the next guy as I had already been advised the phone was running hot.

She might be a great 30 minute trip, if all you want is a bang for 25 minutes, but outside that quite inhibited. I took the 45 minute option and was glad I saved some $ and didn't go for the hour.

You can definitely add quite a few years on to the age, but even still a very nice package - just failed on the delivery. All in all, it didn't work for me and I certainly had trouble surmounting the lack of enthusiasm.

Rating 5/10 - would I go again, no.

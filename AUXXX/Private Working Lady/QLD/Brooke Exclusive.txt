 Brooke Exclusive
				
Post Content: 
In case this has not been raised before I just noticed this ad from someone calling themselves Brooke exclusive on sexportal gold coast and several other sites at around $800 a shot and claiming to be a porn star on tour. The images are actually of Carmen Electra as can be verified with tineye.com The ad looks a little sloppy at best and has signs of 'beware' all over it. Was it meant as a teen prank perhaps? That's the vibe I get from it. Has anyone fallen for it? If it is actually Carmen slumming on the coast I of course apologize profusely and will be only to pleased to make a booking.

Follow up note. I also shot an email to sexportal and they replied this morning to say they had now deleted that profile.

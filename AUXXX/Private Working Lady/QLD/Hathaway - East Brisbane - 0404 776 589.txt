My experience/comments : 

I saw her ad on Escorts and Babes. Contacted her and she was quick to respond. We agreed on a time and she sent me an address which was the house a few doors up from her sharehouse. She then text me and provided the details of the actual place. Went to a random share house in East Brisbane. She came out in a trench  coat wearing nothing underneath and told me to be quiet - I guess her housemates were home.  Room was awful and looked like a junkies. Single dirty matress on the floor that looked like she picked it up from a curbside collect. There was no shower or bathroom.  I booked an hour and she did a silly  dance for the first 10 mins. She then gave me a BBBJ which was OK. Sex was very average and she pulled weird  faces while I was fucking her. Missionary to begin with and then doggy. I found it hard to cum and by the end I had to jerk myself off and she let me cum on her face. We were both very sweaty and she just used homebrand paper towel to clean herself/myself up. Then she led me out a backdoor. To be fair, her photos are the real deal, but she is one of the weirdest escorts I have been to. Pretty sure she was on drugs or had  mental health issues. Said she was Korean but I have lived in Korea and  can tell you Korean she is not. I suspect she is Japanese. She is a very  odd person and not all there. Called me hours after the appointment to  see if I could take her grocery shopping. Nutjob. Avoid at all costs.

Saw her last year, wrote a review.
I guess she's back from her half yearly Melbourne rotation.
She is Taiwanese and works from that sharehouse for work and also rents out another place and has her own sharemates which she lives in when shes not working.
Twice a year when she has money saved up shr will work in a motel for a week. 
Best to visit her then when the environment is more relaxed.

If she's in town she is worth the punt if you like a touch of sleaze. Sports a tat on her lower back so may be offputting if you're not into tattoos. She's not petite. Seen her a couple of times and never rushed. She likes to wear fishnets and lingerie.  I enjoyed 69, doggie, cowgirl, great tongue and real tease.

My experience/comments: Great alround body, was even better than my expectations, her oral skills are dangerously good and you must be careful as you will probably blow your load before you have time to have sex with her. I would definately go back to her, one of the best escorts i have ever been with.

I was feeling a little horny and been focusing too much on rnt so wanted FS switch. Based on the review above, I called Ava and made my walk from Southbank to Kangaroo Point. Ava works from Southern Cross which seems to popular to WLs. After a little wait as she got herself presentable and getting lost trying to find the room due to crap layout, it was on! Now, Ava's a curvier and full-figured lass so definitely not for lovers of super slim girls but right up my alley. She has a cute English accent and is very relaxed and put me right on ease. Service-wise, I'd rate her as GFE with ample kissing and cuddling. Oral wasn't the best I've experienced but still enjoyable and eating her out was more fun. Sex was fun and she seemed to get into it especially on the second go with her riding me. All in all, I'd recommend her and would probably see her again as I do love curvy girls(with sexy accents as well.lol) and her pricing structure's also flexible.

Based on the reviews I've seen and also her pictures, I'd really like to see her. But her ads always says "gents 35+ only".

Does anyone know if she ever makes exceptions, or is it just not worth it to contact her if you're in your 20s?

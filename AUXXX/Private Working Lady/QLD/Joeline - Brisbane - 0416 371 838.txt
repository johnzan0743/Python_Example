Value for money/recommend?:  Overall I did not consider Joeline value for money.  She arrived late and left early, I only managed to get 35mins of my hour booking.  The action part of the booking was ok, nothing to to exciting.  If anything I would say it was a little mechanical.  I would suggest that you spend your hard earned elsewhere.

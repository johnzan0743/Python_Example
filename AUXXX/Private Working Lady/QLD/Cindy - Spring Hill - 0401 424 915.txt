My experience/comments : 
A boring day at work led to me looking for some fun on backpage. Noticed this ad with nice looking photo of a thai girl and booked with text for a 1 hour meeting after work. 

Got to her apartment on time and she answer the text message within minutes. Went in the apartment with ease, and it was very tidy and nice.

However the lady looked nothing like in the ad. Early 30's Asian women with quite a lot of body fat and boobs probably smaller than mine. She got an average face which I can’t even remember how she looks now…

Sorted out the money issue and I went to the shower- quite a lot used towel in the laundry basket so she seems to be quite busy that day.
Went to the bed with my face down. As can be seen from the mirror by the bed she is still wearing her bra and undies as she started to give me the massage. 
The massage itself wasn’t bad at all, quite relaxing actually. But that’s not what I came for…
The lack of teasing and intimacy made me feel like I was in regular massage parlour. 
About 20 minutes left on the clock she eventually proceed to take off her bra and underwear and asked me to turn around. She was sitting beside me started to jerk me off, no body rub or anything you would expect for paying $150 for an hour.
The only highlight of the trip is that she allows me to play with her pussy, probably the only reason I was able to finish….
Overall this was a bad experience. I will strongly advise anyone to stay away from it.

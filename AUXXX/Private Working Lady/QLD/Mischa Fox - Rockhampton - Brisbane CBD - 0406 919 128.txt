My experience/comments: 

Booking was painful with slow replies and stuffing around. I nearly gave up but it was Rockhampton and there aren't many options. She arrived to my hotel a bit late. When she arrived she seemed really nice and organised, and it became clear there was an agent who had been arranging things but not very well. Misha was a bit shorter and rounder than I had thought from photos and ad descriptions but she was cute and friendly and had an it-factor about her.

Misha was a bit shy but eager to please. BJ was good and deep, but not enough before she wanted DATY. DATY was fine, she was responsive. Started in cowgirl before she wanted me on top. Overall pretty good but not top standard. I think she was eager but maybe not as experienced or confident as you'd expect, but her personality and cuteness made up for it a bit.

Misha was good but not great. If she ditched the agent who is probably doing more harm than good, and passed on the saving then I'd recommend. But the $600 she's charging now is a bit of a stretch.

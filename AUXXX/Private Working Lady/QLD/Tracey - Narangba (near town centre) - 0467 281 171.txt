Experience:
Texted Tracey with the word "hi" as she asks. She replied back with options and offers etc. I took option 2 $100 for 30mins which is a nude massage with some playing with her. 
House is very old and messy, down a driveway with a shed that you can park in front of. Apparently someone else rents the shed. The massage room was clean and inviting. 
Massage was passable, but clearly she knows what most guys want and the massage lasted about 5 mins before she reached through and grabbed the jewels and gave them a once over. 
After a minute or two I flipped over so I could play with her. Her tits are amazing. All natural with perfect nipples that she loves having played with. 
I then put her on the table and gave her a rub down, full access all areas. Made her cum with 2 fingers in the pussy and a thumb in the ass. She then gave me Nat oral for a couple of minutes which was pretty decent. I asked what else she does she said nothing, offered her $50 to fuck and she took it. So bent her over the table and fucked her doggy (covered of course) after a couple of "hours" I took off the dom and came on her tits. 
She talks a bit, but was a good time. With the full service it ended up being $150 so a bit expensive, but was much better than the robotic scripted stuff you get else where. If you have a chance, take the punt on her. YMMV I may have caught her on a good day.

My experience/comments: Having just moved to Brissy, I thought I would start posting about my experiences with the working ladies down here.

This past Saturday (14 May), I saw Dallas. She was located in a nice  apartment at Kangaroo Point; there is parking for guests here, which is a  plus.

Dallas would be somewhere between 27 and 35, size 8, long haired brunette, b cups, and is an Australian girl.

I stayed with her for an hour, which set me back $250. She is well worth  the money, as she is engaging in conversation, fun, makes you feel at  ease, and genuinely enjoys her work. She is not a "clock watcher". Her  phone rang a few times during my hour with her, but she did not get up  to answer it, and instead paid her full attention to me (so annoying if a  lady stops to check her messages).

After you've came, she finishes you off with a great massage. Would definitely recommend her.

Kissing on her tits/body/ears etc is allowed. Not too sure about kissing on the lips, as I didn't go for it myself, but I would imagine she'd be okay with it provided you had good oral hygiene

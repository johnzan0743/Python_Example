Hi fellas

I had a booking with Lauren in one the cheap motels along Great Eastern Hwy today.
Lauren is a lovely young girl who is over from Sydney on her Uni break to earn a bit of extra $.
Her photos are lovely and I was half expecting them to be fake so I was pleasantly surprised to find on arrival that they are 100% genuine.

Lauren said she is only eighteen and I would have to believe she is close that age.
She is very articulate and mature for her age.
Lauren asked what I liked and I told her I like lots of passionate kissing and that is what I got.
She has quite a large list of services available on her ad but does not do anal or natural oral.
I only booked for 30 minutes as money is a bit tight.
Overall a very pleasant experience with a lovely looking genuine girl.
She has a beautiful,slim lightly tanned figure with a C cup and very pretty face with long honey blonde hair.

Lauren told me that this was only her second day working as an escort and I believe her.

Lauren has headed back off to Sydney but there is a woman who recruits girls from the East to work in Perth for a few weeks and you see their ads from time to time.
The ads are always similar and they usually work from motels in Rivervale.
They tend to be young pretty Aussies needing a bit of extra money and are often students.

cheers

DD

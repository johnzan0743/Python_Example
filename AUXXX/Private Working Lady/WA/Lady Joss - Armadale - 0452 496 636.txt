My experience/comments :
i always wanted to try kiwi lady, and i found an ad locanto.

i msg her on 23rd oct and got a  reply next day (24th oct) anyway booked for 30 mins session.

confirmed appointment at 12:30pm (luch time), after a long drive to Armadale found the little unit in gladstone road.
First impression after she opens a door was disappointing, she was really old expected early 30s and she looked late 50s.
Anyway though disappointed, didnt want to upset her for her age (bit of respect for the person and for their time)

Though went for FS, i asked her to massage me for 30 mins and i paid $120.
Just to warn other folks that pls add another 20 if the ad says 30 plus age. i spent nearly couple of hours including the long drive to
learn this experience.

Anyway thats my story of kiwi's world

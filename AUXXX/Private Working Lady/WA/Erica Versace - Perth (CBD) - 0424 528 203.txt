Had a bit of spare cash and decided to go for a bit of an upper class punt. Erika was prompt to respond and agreed to meet with me in a short timeframe, so I jumped at it. 

When the door opened, Erika emerged looking fantastic. Pics are all legit, she has a really pretty face, fantastic tits and a great body. Unfortunatley thats pretty much where the positives ended. Erika's ad offers the following services which were denied at the time of booking;

[/COLOR][COLOR=#000000]Affectionate Kissing[/COLOR]
[COLOR=#000000]Mutual French[/COLOR]
[COLOR=#000000]Passion Kissing[/COLOR]
[COLOR=#000000]PSE[/COLOR]
[COLOR=#000000]Porn Star Service[/COLOR]
[COLOR=#000000]DFK[/COLOR]
[COLOR=#000000]CIM*[/COLOR]
[COLOR=#000000]COF[/COLOR]
[COLOR=#000000]Rimming on me [/COLOR]
[COLOR=#000000]Rimming on you[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#000000]No DFK, no COF despite being promised as included in the ad, no option for CIM as an extra, no kissing. As you can expect, when dropping $600 for a punt it was pretty disapointing. BBBJ was extremely limited and was more like a few licks here and there then quickly on with the dom. Sex was fine, plenty of positions, but nothing amazing - I tried to draw it out given the lack of BBBJ, but I got the hurry up a few times and ended up requesting more BBBJ before finishing. This lasted for a good 3.5 seconds before finishing me off with a hand job. All up, it would have been great for $200-300, but at $600 it was a complete joke. Paid for an hour, was in and out in 25mins as it was pretty obvious that there would be no option for a second round.  [/COLOR][COLOR=#000000]

Bad luck Punksta, maybe you got her on a bad day.  I have seen Erika several times in Sydney and I have always found her to be a great performer and lots of fun to be with.  She is a great kisser and normally offers lots of DFK.  Also if you get your rocks off quickly she normally suggests that you have a quick shower and come back for more or maybe a nice relaxing massage.  Better luck next time.

Thanks for the contribution yarra. I appreciate it and I am sure erika does too along with the estimated $4200 you have given her over the several visits. She may be really awesome afterall?!

Bad day or not it is still a detailed review of a fucked up experience . 

I won't be seeing her til I see a string of positive reviews... I look forward to yours  

The more they charge the more you expect ! At $10 per minute every minute needs to be amazing !!!!

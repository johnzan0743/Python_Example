Visited Armagh St approx 1 week ago and saw Shasha.

This place is in a block of flats opposite McDonald's on corner of Berwick & Canning Highway.

Paid $200 for the hour which included twould sessions with Shasha. Very enthusiastic and sessions include BBBJ. Only thing that put me off was cigarette smell in apartment and on her breath.

Shasha is Chinese, reasonable looking and pleasant, say sz 8 but a bit chubby & probably mid 30's and here for only 3 months just for work she tells me. Apartment has another girl working but only one main bedroom and the second room is made by having a partition to divide the main living / dining area which is a bit of a turn off. 

Bookings are via a Mamasan who can be reached via 0413 497 918. I think better options exist for the money

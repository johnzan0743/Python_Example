Reposting 1st post, wrote in wrong place sorry!

    Hello folks,
    Posting for the first time. Was in Perth last week & was taken to this place in Bentley, about a 15min drive from Perth CBD. Mainly a Korean place.
    3 girls were on (weekday) & all were booked. We waited for some 15min & a Korean girl named Sasha, prob early 20s, size 8 very good bod was available.
    My friend had her & I waited. When he finished (1/2hr $110 FS) the others were still unavailable so we left the place.

    Friend said the service was good, she was friendly & fairly chatty & didn't reek of kim-chi, worth a repeat he said. Whilst waiting for my mate the receptionist & I had a chat although phones kept ringing & it appears to be a place worth checking out as some students turn up for work occasionally.

    Well not exactly my review of a WL but hope it qualifies as a 1st post

    Cheers

You're in.

I travel to Perth quite bit and have seen Sha Sha myself but that was before her boob job.
She delivers in every way except BBBJ and Greek.
I genuine GFE if you stay for at least the hour @ $180 and can deliver a PSE if that's what you want.
Had a reputation for delivering the best CBJ in town for some time but I must admit that I have found better in Vivien and Bi BI from Dreamlane. 
Vivien is now private but a real wildcat with attitude and worth seeing whilst in Perth. 
All the Dreamlane girls offer great service consistently. The mamasan Annie has a talent for spotting good stock and she is to be commended. 
The BC website is good for getting and indicator of what most of the girls look like in Perth and as you can see 99% Asian.
Don't take notice of the reviews on this site as they are unreliable and vetted for negativity. I suspect as a advertising site they want to encourage WG's to advertise and neg reviews would rightly put them off.
BC website is http://www.beautifulcompanions.com.au/ and Dreamlane is http://www.dream-lane.com/%E3%80%8Eabout_us%E3%80%8F.
If you need verification of appearance etc just Pm me and happy to verify. I have a lot of mate there who like to punt and my info is real good.

I have to agree with tryhardaussie on this one. I've been to a few places and DL stands out.

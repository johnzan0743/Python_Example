My experience/comments:
Well, as you know, I was dissapointed when I come in cos she isnt as pretty and isnt as young as advertised. BUT, I was horny and wanted the extra service (at no additional Cost).
Any way, went in, get the payment done with, and go to shower. 
I asked for her to join, and she did. She was nice at least and lovely, cleaned me and I get to cleaned her. Nice soft skins with bubble soap and a hot shower was a good start.
Then went to the bed, and got into it right away, and kissed and licked all over her body and mine after. And started with her sucking me (Hard) and tugged my balls too.
While she was using her head, both her hand didnt stop from moving and touching all over. Love that, then went into DATY and she was partly shaven, clean enough though so its good.
And after got into the main dish, did several position and then finish with CIM Swallow which I love!!!

Anyway, showered again (together) and light kiss to part.

Was good for me overall

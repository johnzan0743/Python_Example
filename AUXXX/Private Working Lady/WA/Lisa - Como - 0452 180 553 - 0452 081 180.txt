Hours of Business :  9am till 2am according to the website, I went around 10pm.

Services Provided : Didn't ask.. check listing.

Value for money/recommend? : I wouldn't.... and didn't.

My experience/comments : This is a warning to all other punters.  I look at the photos... I knew it was too good to be true... once I called up and was given the address... I checked the online maps and saw that it was a single storey house... but hang on a sec... the pics looked like it was a loft or something where it was taken.  I was nearby... so I thought what the heck... let's check it out... rang the bell... lady opened the door... the doorway was quite dark... hard to see... got inside... she closed the door... I got a fright when she turned to face me... 
"Are you Lisa?"
"Yes, me, Lisa."
"You don't look anything like the online photos."
"Me, Lisa."
"Erm... it's okay... no thanks."
Then I got my ass outta there.
This serves as a warning to other punters.
(But dang... those photos are just too inviting).

Calls herself KiKi but acts as any of the other names listed (6) on the phone.
$120 half hour, as usual elsewhere.
Add $30 for bbbj
Aqua, Burswood **PWL address removed. BAB**.
Won't go back would not recommend unless you will able to refuse and go elsewhere - always have an alternative to back out to.

All phoney in my experience.
May be one worker (if any) is not. Did not see evidence of others.
Door opened, smelly (cigarettes) person standing in front of me.
Could not possibly be who thought I'd phoned.
Curiosity held me.
Paid funds for 1/2 hour.
Could have got to 19 minutes.
Phone rang and interrupted twice, no apology for stopping while 'on the job' orally - deduct 4 minutes.
Girl could barely understand herself asking if I wanted oral condom or not - deduct 2 minutes.
So 1/2 hour became 13 and felt like 7.
Previous experience here has been awesome but girl left next day (couldn't get any better after me!!)  <-@@->

Previous experience here has been appalling - girl hid seriously bad cough until paid, then did not stop coughing - no refund.

Other names - Cindy (Selina elsewhere), Leena, Candy, ViVi - all names elsewhere in BC.

My experience/comments : I know, locanto, Hit and miss. Needed release early in the morning. Sent a text enquiring if she was still available due to it being so late. Was told that she was if I could meet her in the city. She asked for 30mins to get ready, which was roughly the time that it would take me to get to the city. I asked where to meet and was told the esplanade hotel. I sent her a text letting her know that I had arrived and was waiting. She replied that she wasnt back yet and would be a while. I asked if she roughly knew how long. About 5mins later she arrived at the hotel (my window tint is dark and there wasnt anyone else about so it was quite easy to match her to her pictures) I sat in my car waiting while she had a smoke and talked to two men outside the hotel. After about another 5mins the 3 of them went up in the elevator together. I left. Still waiting on a response from her.

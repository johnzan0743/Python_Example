Whent to ole Garrat st the other day really wanted to try Sky she looks so tasty, but only Tina was free so I thought what the heck. She looks OKI'd say about 7/10. When we got started she did some nice catlicking with moans got me nicley going 8/10 when she got down to my member the usual complaint "Why so big" lol I said rather that then why so small  andyway we continued the deed her cowgirl but I got bored swung her my way and we really got into it I must say I am not sure if she was either getting off or faking it but she was nicley clutching my hands hangin on for dear life (sounds so much better worded like that) as I was taking her.

Its a short report but she was worth a spin YMMV but I losend her up for you

G'day PrawnStar,

Maybe you can help us out with the link to her ad. I typed "Tina" into the search function and it comes up with nothing!

Thanks,

BAB

My experience/comments :  OK, so I've never been with an Indian lady before and always hae found them attractive.

Found this ad on Locanto which appeared to have real pics. Started messaging to arrange a booking, whoever is controlling the phone has limited English. Booked a half hour booking for "full service".

I get to the booking and am greeted by an attractive Indian lady, about 25-30, average build. Walk in and pay for the service. She runs out the room and comes back 5 mins later. She proceeds to lie down and tells me to enter her.

At that point I stop and ask for oral first, it's then I'm told that by full service they mean fucking only. No mutual oral, no fingers, just the root and that's it. Even though we're both naked, I'm not happy with a quick 10 Min fuck when I was told full service. Ask if I can cancel my booking and get some money back. Am then told her "boss" already has my money and no chance of a refund.

I'm not happy, but at this stage I just stick it in and get the job done. Still wasn't happy so instead of trying to be nice, gentle, slow, etc. I just pump as quick (and hard) as I could and get out of there.

Definitely not going back. Would be worth it if they knew what full service meant but unfortunately they seem really amateur and have very limited English.

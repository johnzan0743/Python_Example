My experience/comments : Alright, let's see where to begin... I had read a previous post about an Eva in Shenton Park... Korean... good review... so decided to give it a shot.... alarm bells did go off when the phone number on the website was different to the one in the review.  However, I brushed that off...
Called up, girl with good english (receptionist/mamasan, but that's normal) answered and gave me the address... alrighty then... off we go... easy to get parking... but today was hot as hell.
Rang the door bell... another girl answered the door (late 30's... I'm not having any of that)... I said that I was there to see Eva... no problem... she's finishing a massage for another client, 10 minutes tops.... take a shower first... okay I thought...so took a shower then went back to the room to wait.
Sure enough within 10 minutes... Eva comes in... okay, let's describe from the ground up.... legs... long... slim... we're doing well... dress... white... super tight... body slim.... okay... we're on a roll... arms... slim... long... bust... maybe B-cup.... but packaged into the tight white dress... looked okay... hair... long... okay... then... the face.... right... so.... she's not exactly ugly.... she's not exactly pretty... she's older, could even be nearing 40 if you look hard enough... which I wasn't prepared to do... 
I thought... okay... so what now.... you silly silly boy... took a shower already... hmm... maybe I could get away with just paying for use of shower facilities?  Probably not... that mightn't fly.... so opted for the quickest possible exit.... 30 minutes... $120/half hour.... yes, it's $10 more than what was advertised, but I guess the shock left me stunned... so I parted with my money.
She takes off the dress... alright... so... the body looks like it has had better days... a bruise or scar here or there.... but still seems quite tight for her age... little bit of tummy fat there... my mind tries to blank it out.
"Massage first?" she asks.
"Sure".... afterall, might as well get a massage out of it...
Massage itself was just shy of 10 minutes... you and I both know how that would be... soft and aimless since she's not really here to work in a MP.  I thought to myself... the punter before me just took a massage option... I wonder what he paid and how was his massage?  But I digress...
So, as she's massaging me, I ask if she's from Taiwan, but she tells me she's from China... then she gets back to work (forgot to mention that she has a very deep voice, no, she's not a man)... then all of a sudden she burps... okay... perhaps no to kissing here... then a couple of minutes later... she burps again... and again... well, I'm not interested in any face action anyway.
I stop her before she might actually burp something up and on to me... I tell her that we should get down to business... she takes off her bra... did I say B-cup.... yeah... alright... I'll give her that... B-cup.... small nipples... she pops a cap on junior and gets straight to work... I note that she's still wearing her panties... so I gently motion her to remove those... she does... then gets right back to it.... I caress her body to check out the package... no implants here.... trim bush... tidy... but I dare not go any closer to find out about her hygiene routine. A couple of minutes go by and I'm wondering if her mouth is still suffocating junior?  Cos I don't feel a thing.... Yup, she's still at it... but since I'm not feeling anything I tell her to hop up.
I motion her to get on top for cowgirl... but she tries to pull me up so that she can have a rest it seems... I tell her that I want her to be on top... just for a little while... then she uses the old "back problem" and dives down to the mattress like a gull to a fish.  Fine I thought.... at least I'll teach her a lesson for being this lazy.
So I get into missionary and start pounding away... I get straight into some quick repeated and heavy thrusting.... she's giving out fake moans.... I decide to switch it up to doggie... she reluctantly rolls over and gets into position.... geez.... long legs... had to angle myself upwards so that I wouldn't need to get a stool for junior to reach.  So off we go again... but this time around... she gets a bit more involved and the fake moans get replaced by her arms reaching back to pull me in and she's not resting her head on the pillow for a change but hoisting herself up with her other hand.  Noticing that she might be enjoying this now and wanting more... I quickly finish up and pull out... job done... she slumps back to the bed... she actually did seem to be pissed off...
Anyway, I clean myself up and tell her that I wanted to take another shower... a couple of minutes left on the clock... geez... I worked quickly today I thought... perhaps it was just this sense of wanting it get it over with coupled with the I didn't want her to enjoy this either (not that most of them would, but some do).
So, long story short... quick shower... she's keen to get me out of the house... I was keen to get out of the house.
Would I return?  Not unless it was the other Eva (Korean) who came back!
I wonder if I'm taking on too many questionable punts for the team?
Noob mistake to partake in a shower first before having first examined the goods!

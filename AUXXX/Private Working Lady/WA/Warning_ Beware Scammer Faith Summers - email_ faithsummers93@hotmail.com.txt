On the way to bathroom , she does a runner and boy can she move, she was out the door and 1/2 way down the street before you know it.

I did an out all once to a hotel in Parramatta it was an over nighter, he was a lovely gentleman. After he paid me he told me he had an outcall to same hotel off a lady who bought 2 bags with her. She was getting settled and said I have left my condoms in the car and left with just one bag saying I won't be long. When she didn't arrive back he checked the bag and it was full of newspaper. What a horrible thing to do, karma is a bitch!!!!

That's really dangerous for her.

Personally with no gestapo to answer to, I'd head straight to the police with a prepared statement (though unsure of WA law, in NSW I would), But I am sure there are a few (out there, not here) who would book her again to a different location. Really dangerous and incredibly stupid.

Thanks for the heads up. Not that i will be punting in WA but thank you because you paid twice for this incident. 

I noticed you bought a one week bronze membership for this site so that you could warn us about this cretin.

Why don't you use the review template and review her as a non performing service lack of provider and perhaps we might prevail on the mods to give you a 6 mth free bronze upgrade for reporting this scammer and making us all a little more careful and wiser. Either that and you could review another ML or WL or something and receive a free upgrade anyway. At least you might get something out of this awful experience.

Thanks again ALERTS like this save time and money for members.


Biggus.

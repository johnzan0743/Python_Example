 Heather- Victoria Park - 0403 879 829
				
Post Content: 
Unfortunately, not a review but thinking about taking a punt and reviewing her. I see her advertised on cracker all the time and her website is: Heather Escort in Perth

She looks to have an impressive rack but was wondering if anyone had any feedback on service? I like wild PSE with a little GFE balance.

Promise to review my next punt - trying to make a decision! There is nothing worse than handing over your cash for some miserable shitty experience which happens far too often....

Mate 

The photos are of a softporn girl in the uk. 
I have visited but not stayed. She used to advertise as Charlie.
She is about 45 years of age and looks it.

Wow! Thanks for the intel! Can't believe she would go to the trouble of having a complete fake website.... I wonder what the softporn uk star would think! I would want royalties for use of my photos if I was her..... Fake pics is so fucked up.

There is another girl on Cracker who claims to be 27 and is called Charlii

Would they be the same person ?

Yep same lady.

Some of these women have an incredible gall to take someone elses photo off the net and try to pass it off as their own.
It would be different if they looked very similiar but this woman does not.
She still must get punters who go through with bookings otherwise she would not do it.
Amazin.

I can never remember the website but it allows you to upload and then verify where a picture has originated from. Would that have worked with these pics?

I used it and her photos are certainly fakes.

I think she is now calling herself Rachel on cracker and changed the photos.

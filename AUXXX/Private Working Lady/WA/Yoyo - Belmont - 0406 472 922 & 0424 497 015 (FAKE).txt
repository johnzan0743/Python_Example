Establishment : Belmont

Date of Visit : Early Oct

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : http://perth.locanto.com.au/ID_32267...unchy-457.html

Hours of Business : depends on your arrangement with her

Rates : $150 for an hour

Age : 23 (If fact like 50+)

Size/shape : Petite on phone and photo (But old granma face to face)

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese I'm guessing

Services Provided : natural french, suck your cock no condom, cuming my mouth/face, swallow; and i do anal

Value for money/recommend? : Fake, dont bother coming

My experience/comments : I initially called, and didnt answer.

And finally she message with the second numner, I said I dont know who this is, so she tells me her other number and I reference back and found her again. 

I got the suspicion initially that she wasnt genuine, but I has to try cos I wanted the service she provide all in one.

And I made arrangement, and she send me photo. I didnt really wanna come at the end cos I had bad feeling, but I message any way to confirm. I was hoping that she wont reply me in the next 15-30 min so I can make excuse to not come, cos its really getting fishy.

Any way, she did reply within 10 min, so I didnt wanna be an ass and assume that she is fugly and bail, I went there and as I went to the front door, notice that cob web everywhere and it doesnt look good. 

And she opened the door and BANG!! I knew it, and I showed her the photo and ask if she was here, and she say "yes yes come in its ok". I'm like... are you the WL? She said "yes", and I said well you dont look like her at all. And she say "Yes is me, Come come its ok". I started to back off and she said "Ok no worries" And closed the door.

So messed up....I knew it was gonna be like this, but if she wasnt, I didnt want to ruin her appointment for the right people who is doing the right thing.

But I hate how it has turned into this!!

Well lesson Learned. NEXTTT!!! hehehehe

So fartichoke, I havent been on much, but have been here for a while.
Just curious, I had a look a around a bit.

Regarding my post this time, although I did not go to it and experience the whole session cos I left, would this considered as a post that contributes to my silver membership?
Also, if I have a usual WL that I go to, and I made a different post, would that contribute as well to silver member?

Thanks, and sorry if this question has been asked.

Kindest Regards,
J4

You need only 27 'useful' posts to be promoted to Silver.

This counts as a useful post because anyone in your region would benefit from your post.

OTOH, a question or a one line comment is most often not useful.

Sorry and regarding the second question?  
If I reviewed the same person twice would that count as "Useful" Post?

Thanks

Sorry I missed the second q.

Yes with a few caveats

If you are going to review the same person, the reviews should not be too close together. About 3 months
apart is probably reasonable, although the main thing is usefulness to others. 

If you don't notice any difference in the service, there's no point in posting a review more often than about 3 months, but a report that the service is the same excellent service or continues to be as bad as all get out, 3 months or longer after the last review is also useful.

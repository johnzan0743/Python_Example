 Sexy MalaysianWL
				
Post Content: 
Was in Perth for a short holiday with the missus and managed a night out when she went to visit friends. I did something I have never done before. Looked through the local paper and blind messaged a number advertising a young Vietnamese woman. Now of course this turn out to be BS but nonetheless I had fun. Messaged the number and after a series of messages got an address to go to and prices for service and what extras were available for more money. I took the hour for $180. It was easy to find the place and access was easy. A private flat in a smallish complex in East Perth. There were three woman available and I chose Britany who was the slimmest of the two. A bit solid but not overweight. Large, natural breasts. I think 'D' cups. Very short and pretty and mid 30s. Firstly she took me to the shower and washed me down. A lovely start. Brittany was very friendly and spoke English well. After sucking my nipples for a few minutes I got her to lay on her back and sucked on those delightful breasts and then into some serious DATY. I let my fingers wonder and she was happy to be deeply fingered in the pussy and the back door. She then moved on to a covered BJ. A BBBJ was offered  for $50 but I was not interested at that price. I choose sex in missionary and didn't last long. After a few minutes of chatting she made me a cup of tea and we chatted some more before going off to be washed in the shower again. She did offer a second round and she tried hard to make me come again via a HJ but I was spent.

l was very nervous about going to a private apartment that I had no intelligence about but it was a great experience. The woman here are all Malaysian on short term visas so a high turnover. Brittany was part Malay, Indian and Chinese so very exotic to my taste. I would definitely return to try her or one of the other WLs here. If you are genuinely interested in trying this place, message me and I will send details.

I read about guys doing all the research in the world but sometimes the unknown offers the best outcomes. Not always of course but this was one of those times.

Got a chance to see Britany again. I forgot to mention that the standard charge is $180 per hour. Given that includes 2 showers together, 2 shots and quite a good massage in between these along with DATY, rimming on her and a CBJ as well as deep pussy and arse fingering I found it great value. She is leaving the country in a couple of weeks but I am sure there are plenty of Malaysian women to take her place. I hope to get back to Perth soon to try some of the other women in this place. However, I do suspect they move around a bit due to complaints from neighbours. East Perth seems to be a centre for the sex industry in a Perth. There are also a number of massage shops along Hay St which, unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to try out. Perhaps some locals could do some reviews.

LOL, okay, so how would someone get in touch with the lady/establishment you reviewed?

A link to the ad, or phone number is the way to go if you want to make the information useful to anyone.

There are dozens of massage parlours popping up all over the place, Beaufort St has about 8 of them heading away from Perth after Central Ave.

That is the point really. They come and go. I did offer to provide a number at the time but all these months later it is probably useless. My point really was the value of taking a stab in the dark. Try it yourself, spend some money and provide a useful review rather than trying to teach me to suck eggs. As a long established and prolific reviewer I have some idea of what a useful post is.

It will be great if you could actually provide some reviews on all those dozens of massage parlours and contribute some useful intels to the forum.

To be fair massageboy this review shouldn't be the Private WL section... as it doesn't follow the required format meaning it's unhelpful to fellow punters... perhaps better in the silver or gold members section. 

But alas l understand your frustration regarding users who take without giving back.

I don't really want to continue this but some final words. I think unhelpful is a bit harsh. Numerous members thanked me for this post. You might be right that it is in the wrong section although I did offer to provide a number for those genuinely interested. It was really about being a bit adventurous with your punting, taking a risk and the potential rewards. Thanks to those members who responded positively to my initial post.

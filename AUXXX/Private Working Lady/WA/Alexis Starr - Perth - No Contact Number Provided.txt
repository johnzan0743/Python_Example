 Alexis Starr - Perth - No Contact Number Provided
				
Post Content: 
I read an ad for an Alexis Starr coming to Perth for one week touring from Sydney.
 She sounded good, English, DD bust about 5'4" with nice photos.
 So I phoned her to enquire and she spoke to me and said she would be in Perth tmw and to call again then.
 So I texted her the next day and made a booking.
 Rolled up to the apartment in Northbridge at the agreed time and phoned and texted to get the apartment number and no reply.

 A complete waste of time these English girls.

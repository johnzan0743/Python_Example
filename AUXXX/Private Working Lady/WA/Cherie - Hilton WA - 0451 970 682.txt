My experience/comments : 

Booked for an hour, 

Possibly the worst massage I've ever experienced. Has no clue on how to  massage. Claims to know everything, but really she knows nothing. I  doubt she has ever been trained as she claims and would strongly avoid. 

Place was dirty, unhygienic, she was stoned out of her brain. Would not  stop talking, and worst of all provided one hell of a crap massage lol and could not finish me off but still took full price. 

She has decent tits, medium/big ass and a cute face. But her attitude really sucks, has no idea,

Take your money elsewhere,

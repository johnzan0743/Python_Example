Hi Guys

The Girl New English Rose, she is staying at an hotel in Perth, I book an appointment, she confirms, I drive all the way from Joondalup park my car, She then phones me and asks if I'm here, I say yes, she then does not phone me back will not answer her phone or SMS, I wait 15 mins in the lobby and then leave to go all the way back to Joondalup.  All in all she wasted over an hour of my life, I reckon she just double books and if you are the unlucky punter too bad. What a time waster.

her details are 
 				 							Email: sexilexi24@hotmail.co.uk 
 						 				 							Phone: 0435570830

She is on cracker.

Dan Perth,
That is terrible form on her part.  Joondalup is a far way out, I have been there myself, nice suburb. 
Gets me thinking that maybe a few days to stay in the suburbs ?  Do many ladies stay in the suburbs of Perth ?
or are they mainly in Perth cbd ?

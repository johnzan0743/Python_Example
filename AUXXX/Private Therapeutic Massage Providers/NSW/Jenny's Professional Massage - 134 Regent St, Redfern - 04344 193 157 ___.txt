 Jenny's Professional Massage - 134 Regent St, Redfern - 04344 193 157 ???
				
Post Content: 
Jenny has opened a one woman RnT in an old shop front @ 134 Regent St Redfern (just down the road from the BP) the actual massage table is set up behind the curtain behind the front window so you can see out when inside but you can not look in when out. She keeps the door locked so when you knock she can see out and she usually will pop out and tell you how long she will be. Now for the massage, first of all she is a M.L.C. in her 50's with a solid big flabby belly and a look that says "Boy am I going to pull your cock" the cost is $65 per hour and after stripping my clothes off, she grabbed my doodle before lying on the table, when she started the massaged I thought what the fuck is this as she was just rubbing her and rubbing there but suddenly she starts rubbing her fingers over my arse hole and fondling the nut sack then she starts the old light fingers over my back and bum and legs and balls and when she had a good feel, she asked if I would like some relaxation relief for $20 and turn over Mr.
Now she is not a good looker but you know how it's going to develop into a not a bad hand job, so I lie back and shut my eyes whilst she fondles the Penis then I feel a different sensation and when I opened my eyes and looked up, she has my cock in her mouth and after we both smiled, she then started sucking my nuts whilst rubbing my Brown Eye which she had oiled up.
although there is plenty of parking out front, I think some of the other shop owners know what she is doing as they sort of peak out side when a man walks past, she has an interesting little shop and I mean it is little.................SeaRay

I too tried the above number but had no response.  So I popped in over the weekend and can concur with SeaRay's review.  In fact, I experienced exactly what was described.  Not the best massage, but not the worst.  Went for the hour and the price was $65 with another $20 after the turn.  she is large and remained fully clothed, but, given her size, not such a bad thing.  The weird thing was to be in that little room and to be able to clearly see passerbys walk past the curtained window.  I could see them clearly and it is beyond me how anyone could not see in.  But, no one seemed to do a double take, so I can only assume that they cannot indeed see in.  Quite an unusual experience but worth the punt.

I popped over there earlier today and it looked like nobody was home. Wandered down to 1-3 botany road to try and get a massage there but the "be back in 5" sign was for at least 15 minutes so i legged it missing out on both shops.

Anyone tried the new place on Liverpool St opposite the spanish club? might head that way this afternoon to try and scratch this itch i have

I just drove past Jenny's RnT  @ 134 Regent Street and the OPEN sign was displayed, as "jwb1" it's amazing that you are nude on the Table behind the main shop front pane of glass and you can see out but from the outside you can not see in, Jenny can see you lurking outside and if you stick you face near the window under the "massage" sign, she will see you and come out to speak to you, except when she has your Cock in her Mouth......SR

Has anyone been here lately?, I wanted to give it a try but its always seems to be padlocked and closed when i pass by.
Sign wasn't lit either.

See a lot of shops along this block are closed or closing.

Got a link to the add.
I reckon tantra massage is a con personalydue to them being usually way over priced but each to their own.

Does she have a website

Scampy, I saw Laviras about 12 mths ago and opted for the two hour prostate massage and therapy. It was a great experience, very relaxing and drawn out and ended in a fantastic orgasm (for me). I don't know what the deal is with the unlimited times but there is certainly no clock watching and the attention is purely on you. If you enjoy Tantric style massage with the bells and feathers and other things designed to heighten your awareness of your body then Laviras is definitely worth a visit.

She was out near the airport when I saw her in a lovely and clean apartment and she is a genuine and lovely women and exactly as you see her on her website - Legal Disclaimer

JJ11 - yes Tantric services are pricey but at least Laviras is living and breathing (pun intended) Tantra. She has most likely done all she claims and more in the learning and living it department. I was more than happy with my two hours with her and thought it great vfm. You nailed it though; 'each to their own'.

My experience of of her was different. Tantra appears to be a term used for all talk and no sex.

We "Surfed the waves of passion", but the journey was waterlogged.

This was a few years ago, so maybe  she has changed her ways. . . Maybe.

I have had one of those Jack - lady in Cammeray. There was only talk - full dressed to boot - so I am always reluctant to see anyone claiming to offer Tantric massage as for the most part I agree with your terminology. In this case I am glad I did something a bit different. My session with Laviras was a long slow massage whilst talking me through breathing and feeling. The massage included the use of feathers etc. The whole thing ended as per the description with me playing with her breasts and her giving me hand relief. Having said all of this I have only been once so it obviously wasn't earth shattering!!

I saw Laviras around 6 months ago. Her place is clean and tidy. I was a little freaked out by all the buddist / spiritual stuff she has around and the music she plays during her massage. 
I opted for a 1 hour prostate massage as she really recommended it as a sensual way of releasing tension.
The room was a little cold, the massage was average with lots of strange music playing which I was not really comfortable with. Personally I don't think I felt totally relaxed from this style of massage.
The prostate play was interesting and fun. It's definitely a good way for a chick to get your rocks off.

Overall, very expensive.. think I paid $350 all up. I believe others may enjoy this massage more than me, but I can't justify spending this amount of money again for a rub and tug.
I didn't really get that heightened tantric experience.

I ended up seeing Laviras about 2 weeks or so ago.  I too had a visit very much like hawkeye's.  Very clean and tidy premises, nice shower etc.  I found her very polite and friendly, she looks like her photo's on the website but perhaps a touch older now than when they were taken.  Shower, then some explanation and a slow massage and prostate massage.  I found the Tantric thing too weird and it really wasn't happening for me with her.   

To be fair she does advertise as a Tantra thing rather than a R&T with prostate massage.  So for me, I wouldn't go back.  If you wanted a Tantra experience then she would be great, but otherwise, don't bother.  She was by the way, very genuine in what she was doing.

Oh, it was as mentioned on her website. $260 for the hour.

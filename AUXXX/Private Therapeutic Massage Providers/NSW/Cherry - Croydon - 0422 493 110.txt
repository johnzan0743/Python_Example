My experience/comments : I still had Cherry's number from when she ran the massage shop off The Strand in Croydon. I recall when I had seen Coco who use to run the Stanmore Parlour recommended I see her friend Cherry. Got bored one day and messaged Cherry who advised that she sold her shop and now operates privately from her home in Croydon. I have visited her shop in the past only seeing Lily who was a petite looking MILF with good sized breasts. I thank AHLUNGOR for introducing her to me from one of his past reviews. So I had never seen her before, as she operated from home. I didn't think she was going to offer extras and me having not interacted with Cherry in the past. Another reason is that she has her kid at home and another friend that also has kids in the house hold. I could hear them running about in the background during my massage and her pet dog barking.

Opted for a hard massage and she gave me the hardest massage I've ever had. Afterwards I felt like I'd done a full body gym workout. No touchy feely or brush of the cock. Had a towel over me covered and would lift it up when I turned over. No mention of extras, nor did I ask. Thanked Cherry and paid my dues plus 20 dollar tip. She seems like the girl next door type with the way she dressed. Very modest. Upon exit, there was an older Chinese dude waiting outside. Probably an old regular since she mentioned she still had some regular clientele looking for legit massage.

WIR, yea why not. Maybe I'll get lucky next time, if anyone else happens to win let me know!

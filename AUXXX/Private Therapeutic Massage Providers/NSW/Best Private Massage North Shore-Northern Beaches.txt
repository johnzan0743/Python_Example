 Best Private Massage North Shore/Northern Beaches
				
Post Content: 
What are your thoughts on who does the best private massage north of the bridge. I live in Manly and prefer to visit massage girls (private, not establishments) locally - can't be bothered with the city all the time.

So, who does the best r+t this way? Thoughts?

There are some ladies who operate out of DeeWhy now and used to be in Brookvale. I have only seen the one. She is cauc, good body, not that pretty but offers a really professional massage (nude) and gives a good tug at the end for $60 1/2 hour. Great value in my opinion. She also has another slim friend who works there as well and I believe they will soon have another lady joining them. Apparently there requirements are the ladies need to know how to massage.

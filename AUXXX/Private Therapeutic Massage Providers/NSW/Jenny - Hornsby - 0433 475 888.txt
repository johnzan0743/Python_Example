seeing as this is my nearest suburb, I rang up to make a booking.  Place is nestled in at the back of Westfield in a bunch of 70's apartments.  Jenny is nothing special, the rub was ok to middling, very little A+TT, and a regulation tug.  I would lay my house on the fact that nothing extra is available here, nor is it desired.  

Move along folks, nothing to see here

 Jenny's Perfect Massage - Hornsby - 02 9477 7375
				
Post Content: 
Hi Punters

I finaly got up to this place today in Hornsby, not sure if its actually been reviewed here but I remember reading something about it in another thread.

Its a private unit in a block between the Westfield but the entrance to the unit is inside a door towards the back and no 6 is the first unit on the right through that door. Rang the bell to be greeted by a lovely Chinese girl who I thought was Jenny, but no Jenny was in the bathroom. Jenny introduced herself,she is a slightly older Chinese MILF type who is neither very attractive or unattractive but is very pleasant and easy to talk too with great english skills.

Anyway thinking this was a private situation with only one girl Jenny explained that she has helpers on Mondays and Thursdays I think. Lead to the room which was spotlessly clean and had a good feeling about his place as it was clean and had decent music playing in the background. Took the 30 minutes option for $30 but next time will take the hour or more as Jenny is a fantastic massuse with great hands. If I hadn, t read something about this place doing happy endings I would have said the quality of the massage was too good this is legit and just being satisfied with that. At the 25 minute mark Jenny enquired if I would like to be happy and on acceptancee launched in to it.

Lots of soft strocking of the legs and thighs and plenty of sack and crack attention before the famous words "turn over" yes please was this great or what. Oil was applied and a fantastic release followed from a very skilled practicioner, where do they learn this stuff? listening to punters I suppose and experience, thats why I like the mature ones.

Anyway
Lady Jenny 40 something size 10 Chinese
Cost $30/30 mins $55/60 mins
HJ $20 but didn't specify an amount
Extra's Didn't ask and seems more like a Tiandi operation in that regard

All in all a fantasstic experience and unless you cannot get off without the extra's you won't be dissapointed as this is a therapudic quality massage with the bonus ending.

Cheers Punters

An update on this establishment. I have been back to see Jenny a couple of times and now she seems very relaxed with me. Always a first class massage and tug and if you want other weird things like cupping she can do that too. Anyway finally got the top off today and played with those B bordering on C cuppers. Decent bullet nipples and seemed to enjoy getting them played with whilst she was taking care of Rodger. Thats the first base crossed off the list I will try to round second and third and head for home next week! When I was feeling her up down below she didn't seem to be minding from the outside but its a whole new league to get those pants off and get into those pants...you never know its the thrill of the chase.

This is a private unit.  Please be very discreet, we dont want the council giving Jenny a hard time.  The other girl working there today offers more options, but is a MSGWLF (Mother Some Guys would..)   Fairly ordinary, negligible English, and was asking a lot for the services offered. Did not sample the wares.   There has been a very cute other girl there, but offering only R+T.

Jackfun, She advertises with the phone number in Sparksy's original post in the Hornsby Advocate. The precise address is no doubt revealed when you make an appointment. As has been stated, she works from a private unit. This is not a "call in anytime" sort of place.

I loved the massage.  That's what I was really looking for.  Soft, medium or hard she said.  I said between medium and hard; a bit like how I like my steaks cooked - medium/well!!

I went for the 1 hour session and I paid her $60.  Nothing was mentioned about the tug at this stage.  

This sheila really knows how to massage.  Uses pressure points and is a genuine theraputic maseuse.  Soft music in the background made it even more pleasant.  Towards the 50th minute she asked me whether I'd like a happy ending and I said yes.  She then proceded to use her finger nails softly on my ass and between my legs.  A lovely feeling.  A couple of minutes later she said to turn over.  Beauty!

Tug was also good.  Plenty of ball play and she allowed me to fondle her while she tugged me.  She remained fully clothed during the whole session.  After it all ended she used hot towells to take the oil off me.

At the end I asked her how much for the tug but I knew reading stuff on this forum that it was $20.  She said whatever you think.  I pulled a $20 note out of my wallet and I said are you happy with that and she said yes.

I really liked Jenny.  She is friendly and provides a great R&T service.  I haven't been to Tiandi in Chatswood yet but I would imagine that Jenny is one of the best value punts around.  $80 for a really professional massage and the tug.  Good value in my book and I will be returning for sure.

OK - some negative stuff albeit very minor.  The phone rang twice while I was being massaged.  It was probably one of you bastards!  Ha ha!  She took the calls but was very quick.  She said some bloke asked her if she did nude body slides and full service which she said she doesn't.

Parking can be a bit of a problem.  This place is virtually right next door to Westfields so whenI arrived this arvo there was no parking on-site or in Albert St.  I ended up parking further down in Florence St - a brisk 5 minute walk.

Jenny's massage and tug technique is certainly worth the effort of trying to get to see her.  That is half the problem though, she is booked up a lot of the time (like Natalia at Tiandi) - you may need to persevere.  Also on the downside, when I saw her, the phone rang half a dozen times during the massage (fortunately not during the tug). She does manage to continue the massage while talking the phone, but it is distracting.  It may sound selfish, but when you pay the money, you don't want interruptions like that. On balance great value for money though.  

BTW - if you have a problem finding parking close by on the road you can always use the Westfield car park (first 3 hours free)

It had been a few months since I had seen Jenny and I felt like a really good massage so I rang and booked ahead for a 90 minute massage.  She greeted me at the door and she was dressed in black trousers and tight-fitting black top.  She looked quite nice but I like the milfy types!  I paid her $90 for 90 minutes and I gave her an extra $30 and said "look after me ok" and she said yes.  All up $120 with a view that it might tease a little extra out of her.

On to the massage table and Jenny begins a very nice massage.  Soft, medium or hard?  she asked so I went the hard this time.  I winced a few times during the massage but I was expecting that so make sure when you order a hard massage you know that it will be hard.  She really knows how to massage and I enjoyed it.  Soft music was playing in the background and Jenny was more talkative  than the first time I saw her.  She told me she has a 19 year old son and lives locally in Waitara.  She must just rent the Albert Ave place as a business address.

She again took a couple of phone calls during the massage but she was still able to massage me while talking to the potential clients.  She must tuck it in under her chin.

Anyway she starts to use her nails around the inside of my legs and bottom which was nice.  She then says turn over where she proceeded to give me a nice tug.  During this part I lifted her top up over her boobs and I suggested she should take her bra off.  She didn't say anything and continued with the tug.  I put my hand down her jeans to try and feel her pussy but didn't have much luck as they were too tight.  At the same time she didn't stop me though.

Anyway the deed was done and she cleaned me up using hot towells to take the oil off.  She then gave me a lovely head massage for 10 minutes to finish the session off.  

I will return.

My experience/comments: Have seen Jenny several times and her english is improving. She does a good therapeutic massage and has a great handle on how to finish it off!.

She was happy to take off her top revealing a small tummy and soft, white largish breasts and was quite happy to have them played with. Nice nipples.

Jenny is a professional masseuse and needs to be treated as such.  She is also a MILF.  The "Extra" is just that and nothing more is on offer.  Her place is discrete, quiet although on street parking can be an issue as she is close to Westfields.

Treat this lady with the respect she deserves.

I have been out of the punting scene for a while now due to a change in employment (or lack thereof) so I haven't had much money for punts.  I am keen to try Jodie at Surry Hills, Luna at Merrylands and Ping at Pennant Hills but in the end I went to the chick who I know will do a good job - and that's Jenny at Hornsby.

I went there last week and while I enjoyed myself I was getting irritated by the four phone calls she took while massaging me and another time she had to leave the massage room and attend to someone who was at the door.  She returned a few minutes later and got back to what I had paid her for.  I just think she should put the calls on voicemail.

One change to her operation is that she now has another sheila working for her.  Her name is Gin and I got a good look at her when I left.  Jenny told some blokes on the phone that Gin was around 35 years old but I can tell you she is in her 50's and not good looking.  But she might be good - you never know.  I'm telling you this because Jenny is so busy now that when people phone her she tells them she is busy but Gin can do you now.

Anyway I had the 1 hour massage which cost $80 - $60 for massage and $20 for tug.  Despite the interruptions she gave me a lovely massage and a good tug.

The last time I went here I noticed Jenny had someone else working there named Gin.  Anyway I rang up this week to make an appointment and Gin answered the phone.  She is really difficult to understand on the phone as her English is not very good at all.  From what I could work out Jenny was not there and she was the only one working.  She is not the best looking sheila but I wondered whether a not-so-pretty type might be hotter than the usual type of massage girl.  Anyways I made a booking for one hour.

When I got there I was greeted by Gin who immediately took me to the room on the left of the unit where Jenny usually works from.  Gin told me that Jenny is away doing study.  I asked her how much for 1 hour and she said $50.  Jenny usually charges $60 + $20 for tug.  So it seems Gin is charging $10 less than Jenny so I gave her $70 all up.

Gin did not talk at all during the massage so I just laid there quite happy in anticipation of what I might expect in the unfolding next hour of my life.  I must say I enjoyed Gin's massage just as much as Jennys - if not more!  She seems very experienced and obviously knows how to massage.  At one stage she climbed on to the massage table and used her legs and knees to apply pressure to my back and legs.

Towards the end of the massage proper she started to use her nails on my bum which is very similar to what Jenny does as the intoduction to "please turn over".  However Gin got her hands under my body and gave the crown jewells and jolly rodger a nice play before the turnover.  I must say that this was more than what Jenny usually gave me.

On turnover Gin does not hurry to get the job done.  She teases you with her nails and hands around your groin area before finally concentrating on getting you over the line.  I enjoyed the tug and I rate it better than Jenny's.

Gin was fully clothed during the massage in black slacks and a top.  I tried to play with her tits and pussy but she moved out of arms reach so I couldn't do that.  And if looks could kill!  She gave me the filthiest look when I tried to touch her so I backed right off and just enjoyed the tug but without the little bit of touching that Jenny used to let me do.

So $70 for a RNT with a 50 year old chinese woman I thought was pretty good.  Don't go there if you want someone young and you can have a bit of a play with.  But if you want a good massage and tug from an older woman without touching and extras then this is your girl.

Value for money/recommend? : yes

My experience/comments : Felt like a bit of an expedition today so rang and made an appointment to see Jenny for the first time. BTW this was definitely Jenny (not the other lady Gin). Jenny was friendly and when asked I opted for the medium massage 30 minutes. I handed Jenny a $50 note and said 'relax massage ok?' which meant I didn't expect any change and Jenny knew what I meant.

The massage I'd have to say was above average, a fair bit of use of the elbows (I sometimes think this makes it easier than pushing with the hands and fingers) but very good and relaxing just the same. The tug was good as well Jenny made sure I was comfortable and asked how I liked it (fast , slow etc).

Only small criticism was when I asked for a second shot I was turned down, "two times not good for body". However I think Jenny just didn't want to clean up again or thought time was up or similar. 

Ratings:

Massage        8 out of 10
Happy Ending  7 out of 10
Service          7 out of 10 (would be higher but left one in the spout)

Will I be back? Yes, but maybe not for a while as it's just a bit out of my way. I left happy and then Jenny was completely upstaged by Ping at Pennant Hills (I'll review that visit separately).

I was going to see Jenny a while back but it didn't eventuate...
Anyway, not often I have the need to cross over to the north side but yesterday was one of those days.
I asked  for 45 minutes for medium massage and asked her to do a good job and handed over $75...
Not sure if she would have done it cheaper for that time but after reading the good reports on her I wasn't too worried.

Her massage was professionally top class and as she started to near the end with the butterfly style, I informed that I would rather have the gentler rubbing type in all areas.
She enthusiastically said OK and preceeded to dreamily massage by big arse, inner thighs and every little nook and cranny you could imagine, without actually feeling the old fella.....
I was in fucking heaven!
I have not had a better fair dinkum ffollowed by sensual massage since Luna at Merrylands or Amy at 115 Oxford street Bondi!
I wanted her to grab my cock but she just continued rubbing ever so close in the groin area and my arse crack....Then she told me I had a nice bum....an apple bum she called it.
At this stage I wanted her to start with my cock as I was that pent up it wasn't funny....
But she just continued to massage the bum, crack, inner thighs and lower belly.
Finally she asked me to turn over.
My old fella was standing as stiff as a board waving in the breeze.
With the same sensual style she massaged my arms, and then my chest and tummy, giving the old fella the occasional bump.

Then as I lay there with my eyes closed, I fellt her stop massaging.
With my eyes still closed in expectation, she came back with her hands full of baby oil and started to lightly stroke the old fella. This continued for 5 or 6 minutes until I was really busting, and I just said fucking harder, harder.
She proceeded then to jerk me off.
I opened my eyes and stuck my hands down her attractive low cut blouse, undid her bra, and stuck one of her beautiful tits in my mouth.
She actually shoved it in more, then gave me the other one to suck........
Finally, WHAMMO!!! I came with some shuddering spasms that left me laying back totally exhausted.

She cleaned me up, asked if I was OK and gave me a little peck on the lips.
I started getting dressed and asked her if I could suck her pussy next time...
She laughed and said no not really then mentioned other girls that worked there.

Massage: 9/10
Sensual finishing:9/10
H/J: 9/10


I have never given anyone a perfect 10, but this came close!

I just hate crossing the bloody Harbour bridge to see her!!

Will I cross the bridge again? Bloody Oath!

I was shopping Westfield late on a Friday afternoon in Hornsby in need of some TLC. I checked Jenny's phone number on this thread and gave her a call. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that she was available and could see me straight away. I took the short walk to her address and was given the rundown and chose 1 hr for $60. Jenny was friendly and made a good impression on me as she has a great attitude. This was the first visit to Jenny for me and I was keen to see her after the reviews here.

I got all of my clothes off and lay face down. I asked for a firm massage which is what I received. Jenny is a professional in this area and beats most other ML's at shops. It just depends what you are after. More sensual and playful with B2B or therapuetic. I really enjoyed Jennys technique as it is very relaxing and soothing. There was some nice tackle teasing prior to turn over which feels great. On tried to play with the boobs to no avail and she moved away and said next time. She has a perfect style with the tug and got me over the line very nicely. A nice cleanup with warm towel then ensued and still had some spare time for a hand massage finished of with a head massage.

I really enjoyed this time with Jenny and will be back for a return visit.

I've seen Jenny a few times this year and I thought it was about time I reviewed her once again.  Nothing has changed in her service.  She provides a very nice therapeutic massage and a reasonable tug that has never failed to get me over the line.

She stays clothed the whole session while I was completely nude except for the towel that she places over you.  It's just a nice relaxing massage and she also gets on the table and puts her knees into your back and legs to untangle any knots you might have.

Towards the end of the therapeutic massage bit she uses her nails around the inside of my legs and bottom and as I arch my hips she then slides her hand up and commence playing with the tackle.  Very nice.

Then it is the inevitable "turnover" and she then proceeds with a nice tug.  I did not attempt to play with her tits or pussy this time around.  Thankfully she did not take any phone calls during the service.

All up it is still the same professional massage from a nice lady.  I recommend for anyone looking for a decent massage with a happy ending thrown in at the end for $20.

This MLC ML has advertised that her services are under New management I mean WTF?
How can a one woman operation get new management unless she was out of her mind before and no longer is. Or perhaps now she has changed management strategies i meant to say 
Somebody should at least try and give some guidance rather than just accepting this bullshit taking her money and placing the ad.

BTW This one is not worth revisiting at all. just tick it or forget it. Been there once wish i didn't very very very ordinary massage and more ordinary tug.
Way overpriced for what is on offer. But of course that is IMHO.

Biggus, I'm really confused about your comments.  Firstly, I think you may have this Jenny confused with someone else as she is still operating on her own and there in NO new management or any other people involved with this sole trader business.

Secondly, tough call to say Jenny provides an ordinary massage when the majority of the posters on this subject have raved about her massage.  Anyway I think you may have her mixed up with someone else perhaps.

I made a mistake with the days she works in my post above.  It should have read she is available Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat & Sun.

Brad There was an ad under her number that suggested that she had new management. Yup hard to believe but unless the local rag got it wrong it makes her out to look a little wacko. I had a chuckle at first but then upon reviewing the ad realised that perhaps this was just a Chinese marketing trick. Never works but gives us a laugh. You know the thing that will of course attract the hoards is the placement of the word "New" alongside of any advertisement.
The fact is I am sure Jenny gives a competant massage and perhaps a competant tug. However the fact is she has little more than that going for her.

It is a fact that if you see someone just the once and they leave you with a poor impression then the facts remain that you probably won't be up for returning to that business. This is a simple really. First impressions leave a lasting legacy. If you simply cannot be bothered with a first impression as a PML then you probably won't stay in business for too long. It surprises me what some punters will accept. She is way too expensive for the service she provides.
Perhaps she gives you a better service but for the money there are plenty better around. Including some PML's not necessarily Asians either.
If you travel just a little down the road you can have the choice of excellent massage some with some without tug options. Mostly MLC but all with better reviews than Jenny.

Sorry but I simply call it as i see it. The place that Jenny works from is old and the setup she has is very ordinary. She doesn't show any flesh nor is it an option.

The only way I would go back and see her is if she were to offer some better service or even options. Problem is if she has enough traffic through then she simply is not interested in changing what could best be described as more of the same. Simple really.


Biggus.

There are not many private R+T in the area.  She provides a good therapeutic massage.  Neighbors have previously complained to Council, so she follows the rules carefully.  FS is available in the area, but only from establishments that not everybody is comfortable with.  She has been doing OK for some years, so no doubt the price will stay the same until another private R+T opens up to compete.

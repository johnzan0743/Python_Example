My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Ad in Northern Leader reads "BEST EROTIC SWEET B2B 0456 369 949 Amazing! Looking for a good time with pretty Thai!"

Booked 30 mins and directed to unit near South Tamworth Bowling Club. 
Her English was passable without being great.
Greeted by petite and pretty Thai in lingerie. Decided to upgrade from massage to FS. 

Began with an ok (but rushed) nude massage on the bed including body slides on back but not much tackle tickle.
On flip switched to some brief ball licking which felt great, then on with condom for a decent CBJ. 
Next she sat on top for cowgirl. From there we switched to reverse cowgirl followed by finishing off in doggie.  There was still nearly 10 mins left. When I declined a shower, she filled out the time with a decent neck and shoulder massage (though massage on a bed is never the best). 
All in all, a pleasant time and would return.

PS: my impression was that she is a PML who does FS rather than a PWL who does massage. Hence, the FS option is viewed as an alternative ending to HJ after the massage - rather than truly FS. My guess is that the hour FS option would probably be mostly massage. But I might be wrong. 
(It might be wise to check first if you are after more extensive FS)

Reviews with no name of the provider are not much use really. Always ask and remember the name to make the review useful to our members.

While I agree that a name is better than no name, I would have thought that a review was still better than no review.
Are your saying I should not have posted this review?

No I am saying that you should always ask and remember the provider's name, it is not very hard to do after all. 

Often these girls share a phone number so helps to distinguish who was seen.

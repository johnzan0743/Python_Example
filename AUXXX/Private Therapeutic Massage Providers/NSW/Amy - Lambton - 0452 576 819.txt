My experience/comments :

Was up in Newcastle so I thought I'd take a punt at one of the advertised massages in the Lakes Mail. Saw Amy at New Lambton in a house opposite the 7/11 in the main street. She texts you the address when you call.
Amy is tiny and you can tell she's not 20 something anymore but she's OK enough for a punt so I continued on after arriving. Her massage is on and off - pros: slows down sometimes and gets into knots/cons: a little too fast, not very relaxing. On the turn she offers naked for an extra 20 then a CBJ for another 20 so all up its $120 for an hour and a CBJ. She lets you touch her anywhere and the BJ is damned good.
So all up it was OK - probably wouldn't go back but I'm not pissed about it either.

It's a private house nextlife - right on the corner of the road opposite the 7-11 across the main road. You need to park in that road - nothing on the main road.

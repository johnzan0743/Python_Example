 Remedial Massage covered by Private Health Fund
				
Post Content: 
Hi there,

Long shot, i know, but does anyone know if there are any girls out there that provide remedial massage plus a little more with the ability to claim a portion back from your private health fund.
Highly unlikely but hey, thought I'd ask!

PM me if you like.

Cheers!

Hi Coral,

The answer surprisingly is yes, while not all RN places are able to offer that, many can.

What part of the world are you in?

I just searched the forum for the word "rebate", (search engine is in top right box) and got a number of threads to look through.

Hopefully this is the link:

http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/search...earchid=307504 

If the link does not work search for "rebate".

Cheers

Chalk

And if you don't have any money, do a search for "masturbate" instead of "rebate"!

Seriously though: some do promise it on their site but your best bet is to call and ask them to make doubly sure.

Again a few years ago, I thought I'd try my luck in a chinese medicine place in Marrickville that also offered massage.
The old chinese guy called out this average looking chinese lady to give me a massage.
The room was just partitioned with curtains and I thought, Oh well no hand job.
She covered me with towles and started to do the massage and I got a roaring horn.
She was giggling and so I put her hand on my old fella and felt under her dress and started fingering her.
She was getting so horny she couldn't stand up straight and was handling my old fella quite roughly as she finally collpased on the massage table as she orgasimed...Man my hand was so sticky!!
She then uncovered me and started kissing the old fella in her still state of exstacy until I finally came.
This apparent legit chinese medicine place is still open but I'm not sure if Amy is still there.
It was without a doubt one of the best experiences I have had, probably because I expected just the massage.
I'll try and get the number and get back with it.

OK, got it!
It's number 135 Marrickville Rd Marrickville and the name of the "legit" place is  "Win Ming Chinese Herbs and Accupuncture"
Not sure if Amy is still there or not....
But it was certainly one that sticks in my memory and I got a rebate!
LOL

Another chinese lady at a legit joint I once saw was Lucy at Parramatta...
She seems to work with another chinese guy who  dispenses chinese medicine to plenty of chinese customers.
It is a small cubicle with just a curtain, and the massage is excellent.
Towards the end she noticed I had a roaring hard on and I motioned to her to look after it.
She said an extra $20 and I accepted.
I only saw her the once quite a few years ago, but rung her up last week and she is still working.
With the shortage of decent private massage ladies around, I might give her a go again next week.
I actually forget the address but will ring her back for that.
Her number is 9635 3205...
She is from memory about 40ish and quite tall with good size tits and not too bad looking.

Will report back late next week.

Quite a few RnT places advertise "Health Fund Rebate".     (Bit surprised you havent noticed that in the ads).   I think they have to have a qualified masseur on the premises.     Pink Ping at Pennant Hills and 20/3-9 Terminus Street Castle Hill are two out my way that offer massage rebate with extra HJ (and sometimes nude). 

I dont frequent FS places so cant comment on whether you can get a rebate anywhere - I doubt it.

Okay you guys ...don't delude yourselves. most of the places that state they give rebates only issue receipts. No Hicaps (instant eftpos refund) machines at dodgy places. reason is the Hicaps registration and machines cost money and if you lose the Hicaps the business loses its ability to service extra clients. Rarely will you encounter a hica[s machine at a R&T shop. So most health funds will accept receipts as long as they can look up the name and association that is registered. Most receipts are not worth the paper they are written on and if you submit the receipts to a health Fund that does checking well if you read the fineprint that is fraud and you are in the shit. Moral of the story is you should be careful and wary about submitting receipts to the Funds. most only give back $30 per session and it is capped. If you have a family cover remember the other half can access the records so....wiseup and spend the cash... no need to defraud the system...

Noticed this issue is running in the media again with Medicare finding some of their service partners (? not sure how they were described) are actually prostitutes.

What is the bet that this involves that same business that stirred up Chatswood and is probably contracting to a lot of NSW councils - cant they just fix our roads?

Unfortunately the days for all our "Mediwank " followers is in decline as the scrutiny of various "service providers" intensifies ...  Get your therapy quick before you have to pay full freight ( like the majority of us ) ....

Suzi - Cracker 0410765018


Saw the photos in the ad which definitely got my attention. Since i prefer i private punt (but haven't had a good one in a long time), i thought i'd give this one a shot.


Easy to make an appointment to see her in her apartment. Advertises as Artarmon, but is actually Chatswood. Nice clean premises and very private. Parking can be an asshole though, depending i guess on when you go, if you go.


Knocked on her door and was greeted by Suzi - in tiny tiny cut off jeans shorts and singlet top. I immediately thought i was gonna have a lot of fun with this one, and any thoughts of rocking up and finding a chick with a horror face were dispelled. In my opinion, quite attractive face, but not jaw droppingly hot. i doubt would be the same ratings if there was no makeup. Friendly girl, i'd say about 30-35 age bracket. Certainly not the "student" type she advertises.


Maybe a size 6 frame, with fake C cups, pale skin, long nipples, long flaps. The photos in the ad are real. The tattoos are a dead giveaway, and the background in the photos are in the apartment she's working in.


Nice amenities, showered, and she showered also but separate. No complaints there.


I booked for a massage / rnt. One hour at $150


Once in the room, immediately tried to hit me up for FS. I said no, but maybe next time not on the first date haha.


Man, everything is extra with this girl, and too many can't do this, can't do that. Touching was not allowed WTF. Wouldn't allow me to touch her below bits, and said that was extra $50. DATY was extra $50. Pulled away when i put my hand on her ass. All of this i guess was to lure me into shelling out the extra dosh. This punt was going nowhere in a hurry, and was one of those punts where i had booked for an hour, and at the 30 min mark, i looked at the clock and thought, what the F am i gonna do for another 30 mins. Thought of all the other things i could be doing, rather than being there.


In the end, allowed me to suck on her nipples to try to get me over the line because her tug was not inspiring. Massage was about as firm as a feather duster. Big pity, because looks-wise, this chick is hot.


Definitely won't be back.


Wouldn't mind having a crack at her friend who was there watching TV during the whole thing though. But i won't be back to see Suzi.

You know there seems to be a proliferation of asian hookers working out of Chatswood who are good looking and advertise on Cracker and they clearly are not interested in satisfying their customers , see my review of May  from a year or so ago in a thread for a bird names Amy with all the same attributes.


 Amazing Thai girl in Chatswood 
Shit I hope she is not the same dud root I saw last year, her name was May and advertised on cracker as providing the full GFE and she supposedly loved DATY . She was located in an apartment on Thomas street, well when I met her she certainly looked hot but as for performance a total dud.
No DFK in fact could barely get her a simple kiss let alone get her to look at me, didn't want me touching her tits let alone sucking on them and playing with her pussy was a real chore she turned side on so I could barely touch her, DATY was out of the question.
The CBJ lasted about 2 minutes and was a real flop and the sex was a total dead starfish.
She looked bored and couldn't get done fast enough ( and no it's not because I am off putting I am a very clean respectable punter with no complaints elsewhere )
She provided none of the services advertised and I tried to put a warning on Cracker to other punters but it was removed.

My advice- Keep right away if you don't want to be ripped off !

No, its not May. It appears to be a group of girls, although Suzi with the tattoo appears to be the main girl. If you look on cracker there are several ads for thai girls or vietnamese girls in chatswood/artarmon/willoughby areas. All these numbers are answered by the one receptionist girl who will then call the girl who is working to let her know you are coming. Last time I went I saw a thai girl called Jackie who was up from melbourne for a couple of weeks. She told me when she was there in chatswood, Suzi would go work somewhere else, or in an established shop somewhere, but didn't give me any addresses.
I believe May who worked in Thomas street has left the country.

Good useful appraisal, seifa29... I've been analyzing these cracker ads for a while and tying them to punting possibilities and the occasional reviews that pop up. Seems like a couple of the girls may be worth the effort but most are a rip-off. To pay up to $320 for a dubious 1 hour service compared with a very reliable $150 service available a short drive away (@ 533 and others) is a definite no-no!

Thanks for the intel

Jackie (from Melbourne) does work in this group with differing numbers and provides good service - see separate previous reviews - however because they change the numbers, descriptions and adverts re location every week it is a really hit and miss group

i ended up seeing suzi month or so ago. while i agree she is not into gfe and can see where the OP was talking about, i didnt' partake in any extras the 150/30min however the sex was good she enjoyed riding and made a good effort certainly no star fish and i enjoyed pounding her. i wouldn't rule out a return but maybe i am secretly hoping to see the "cleaner" who does booking and greeting she is so hot even in casual clothes. anyone who has seen one of the girls and is into petite girls will know what i mean. The pics are real which is a good thing and IMO Suzi was hot but i am not a fan of tattoos

i havent seen any of the ads on cracker for this place anyone have any intel?

I am in agreement with Hard in that I cannot see why anyone would waste their money on the Asian privates that advertise on Cracker and the like. 

There are so many well known top performers at the likes of 533 and 104 where you get excellent and consistent service from pretty girls for $150 -$160 per hour.

Agreed to the sense that Cracker does not seem to have a high success rate.

However, i much prefer a punt on a private operator, as a good one usually gives a more personalised service, and i know the proceeds go directly to her, rather than the organisation. Also, privates are usually more flexible in the availability in comparison to girls at a shop where they stick to shifts. When you're horny, you're horny.... and what to do if your regular shop girl is not working that day?

A punt is a punt, and if some of us didn't TOFTT on the private operators out there, then I'm sure we'd be missing out on a lot of talent. This punt of mine just happened to miss the mark.

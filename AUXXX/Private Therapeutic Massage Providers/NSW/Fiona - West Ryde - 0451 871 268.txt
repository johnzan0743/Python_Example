My experience/comments :

I've visited Fion 3 times now but I only recently found time to put up reviews here. Let me start by saying Fion is a great masseuse, probably 1 of the best therapeutic masseuse I've seen in recent times. She's got great technique, good strength and control so she knows where to target and how hard to push. Her photos are real and are definitely her although they are probably about 5 years old and she is obviously in make-up in those photos. She is still pleasant to look at in person. Her English is not great but can speak very basic English.

After all that, I must say that her prices are really expensive. The prices above and in her website (tantric and below) are excluding extras. So she charges $50 for a tug and an extra $50 to take her top off. My personal opinion is if you want to see her, don't bother with Nuru. There's really not much different to her actual massage and her body to body is not mind blowing and not worth the extra moolah. Her tug technique is decent. Slow and sensual but again not mind blowing. All in all, I can't complain much given I've seen her 3 times now but she's definitely a lot more expensive than what you can get from RNT shops.

My experience/comments :
Been off the punt for a while. After reading Lif's review, I thought i would give Fion a try. I made a booking quite easily in the evening.  Response was quick and a time was sorted. Got the address and made it in time. Issue is that these apartment numbers aren't lit up well. To find the right block in the evening wasn't easy but maybe that was just me.

After finding Fion's apartment, although old it is well kept for it's age with a bathroom for a shower to use after the experience is over. I saw the website prices, and basically really wanted a massage only. Just to note she does ask you if you want to choose a more  expensive option. I just wanted to really try it as I had some aches.

I went for the deep tissue massage, her massage is quite good, I must admit like Lif she knows what she is doing. A lot of elbow work and a lot of pressure, she makes sure it's not too hard and check quite regularly at the start if the pressure is ok. I was quite relaxed throughout the massage. 

She then works on part 2, i then worked out basically what this whole experience feels like. It basically feels like my old regular Yuki. I must say I used to like going to Yuki way back years ago in Ultimo though her new workplace I just feel that its a bit cramped and I just didnt have the same connection. Fion's massage is very much the same, maybe a little better than Yuki but part 2 is on par as Yuki

So all Yuki fans maybe go have a try if you are in the area. Though would I go back most likely not, the price is a bit more expensive than the usual places, and I would probably go see Yuki as it was cheaper to see her too. I'd say if Fion worked in a shop she may be very popular like Yuki because of her massage skills. Part 2 are better than normal i think but i also have had better and worse.

Fion isn't bad just the price and a little too far for me

Search on google about erotic massage and find her in West Ryde. Provide good massage with happy ending but no sex service. She looks really nice with natural c cup (i think) and she will take off her clothes and jerking your dick off as progress through your massage. highly recommend and she has a nice place and is prive and quiet. She won't give you details address unless you have confirmed booking with her.

Thought I'd take a punt on this a few weeks ago after googling whats around in West Ryde. Fion was easy enough to get the appointment with, on street parking and easy to find the apartment.  First things first. If you google videos of Nuru Massage and that is what you are expecting, you'll be disappointed.  Her apartment is old and a bit dingy but clean enough. Her Nuru massage is just a table massage with what feels like more oil.  I opted for the "interactive" massage as I like to touch, but $350 fuck me that's expensive. FOr that money you can get all kinds of stuff at other shops with very attractive women, but hey I was hoping to find something new.  The massage was great, very nice and went for about 45 mins (too long for me before the turn over).  Very professional and she knows what shes doing. Once on my back she was naked with a gorgeous pair of tits that I fondled. But she kept her undies on!!! FFS $350 for the hour for "interactive" and shes not even totally naked and the touching doesn't seem to include the pussy! I was starting to feel ripped off.

I asked her if I could massage her. So we switched positions and she LOVED me massaging her... this is where the tide started to shift.  I massaged her back and shoulders and inner thighs while she played with my cock while laying down. I got her to turn over and really gave her a slow and erotic front massage and started to gently massage her pussy. She was responding very well and asking me where on earth I learnt to touch like that etc. I started to go into her panties and massage her pussy lips... she was getting very wet. After a bit of this I leaned in to kiss her pussy... no objections.  Undies still on but pulled to one side I started to tongue her clit.  She has a gorgeous pussy and I just love to eat pussy. I wanted it all over my face.  She was getting quite hot and I thought hold on I might even get to fuck her at this rate!  But alas, she cut the pussy eating short and insisted that now it was my turn again. Dammit!  I said I wanted to lick her pussy and she said ... "next time, next time you lick my pussy, I like it".  Okay I thought.  I laid down and she gave me an expert handjob while I played with her lovely tits and she kept complimenting me on how she liked me massaging and touching her. I blew a big load and still wanted more.  I really found her sexy.  So I said I'll book again for tomorrow morning and can I lick your pussy then? She said "yes, but I don't think you'll come back, you will change your mind".  She said message me to confirm before you go to sleep.. or before midnight. I messaged her to confirm and she said "great, what kind of massage do you want?"

I'm thinking... we already talked about this I was coming back to eat her pussy.  Anyway, I said, me massage you like today and kiss your pussy, how much for that?  She goes "treatment" massage then.  Okay so I rock up at 10 am the next day all keen. And she shows me a price list on her phone... I'm like? what?  I'm back here because you told me to come back and lick your pussy today.  She then plays dumb like she doesnt understand and points at the price list to the "treatment massage" for $150 for the hour.  Mmmmk. I'm thinking what the fuck is going on. So she gives me the exact same massage as the "nuru" one... only she stays clothed.  get's her tits out at the end and I'm like... soooo we talked about me massaging you again and licking your pussy... can we do that.  She goes, "Next time".  I just stay polite and go "okay", but inside I was quite frustrated.  So she wanked me off and I left... quite annoyed at the two transactions and the kind of bait and switch vibe.

Overall I actually liked her, very pretty, great tits and body, great massage and very sexy and great hand job. But what the fuck with the pricing and stuff.  Very expensive and not good value. I won't be back

I saw her once, she is pleasant but flat out being worth anymore than the standard $110. I think she is half a nut job but seems to get enough clients to pay the rent, if she modified her pricing she would be swamped with business, maybe she is lazy and 1 job a day is enough for her.

I am bored, looking up massages in Hong Kong and Taipei on the iternet, as there is no massages in real life at the moment. It took some time but I found Hotel Massage in Hong Kong. Its got pictures of lots of sexy girls with half blacked out faces, Tantric and four hands massage etc. In the "contacts " section below the Hong Kong phone number was the phone in West Ryde NSW 
       0451871268. 
There is definitely a Hong Kong connection for Fion.

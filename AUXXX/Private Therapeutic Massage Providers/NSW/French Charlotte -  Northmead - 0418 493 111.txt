 French Charlotte -  Northmead - 0418 493 111
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name: Charlotte

Establishment: Private home in Northmead, from which she runs a weight-loss business.

Date of Visit: 23 December 2016

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 
0418 493 111.  She advertises in the Parramatta Advertiser: "Stress and fatigue full body massage, no sex.  Call Charlotte 0418 493 111".

Hours of Business: Last appointment at 7:00 PM, unsure about first, probably 10:00 AM

 Rates: $60 per hour for therapeutic massage, + donation to Westmead Children's Hospital of an amount chosen by client, generally $20 expected.

 Age: Mid-70s (she claims to be late 60s, but I know she is older than that since she once told me she was a little child in France during the War)

 Size/shape: 
Short to medium in height, chunky but not fat, straight dyed blonde hair tied in a pony-tail, dark brown eyes, swarthy complexion, generally Mediterranean appearance, cannot tell dress or bra size, but she wears a large bra and must had a largish bust when she was young. Fairly broad hips and nicely rounded bottom.

 Nationality or Ethnicity: 
French with Italian surname, but has lived in Australia since the late 1960s.  Speaks with a marked French accent.

Services Provided: 
Therapeutic massage, health advice, hand relief at the end of the massage, and also at the beginning and in the middle if requested.  Under no circumstances will she be nude or perform any further services, as she regards herself as a health professional who assists her clients to ejaculate in order to maintain prostate health.

 Value for money/recommend?: 
From my point of view, $80 for a good therapeutic massage with touching of my penis and balls, and a handjob at the beginning and the end was excellent value.  I prefer to receive a handjob from a professional massage therapist or other health professional rather than from a stereotypical sex worker.  Her age for me is no problem since I will soon be turning 70 myself.  I have no hesitation in recommending her to those who have similar preferences to mine, but I realise she will probably not be to the taste of the average member of this forum.

 My experience/comments:
This was not my first visit to her by any means, since I have been visiting her off and on since the mid-1990s, and must have seen her at least 20 times in that period, almost every time I was in Sydney.  I stopped seeing her around 2009, mainly because I was not visiting Sydney as much as previously, and I thought she might have retired, given that her ad no longer appeared.  However, around the middle of last year I looked in the Parramatta Advertiser and saw her ad, although it was not the same as previously.  I called her up and found she had moved to Northmead from the address I know in Parramatta.  I mad an appointment, and when I arrived she recognised me, despite the hiatus of a good seven years; I was pleased to find that her massage and hand relief was as good as I remembered.  The massage I am reviewing is the second I have received since re-establishing contact with her.

She operates out of her home, from which she runs her weight-loss business.  Next to the front door is a large notice showing her full name, so she obviously has no concern about it being generally known.  The massage followed the pattern to which I had become accustomed on my previous visits.  She directed me to her massage room and stayed while I undressed.  I asked her to give me standing hand relief at the beginning of the massage, to which she had no objection.  I stood next to the massage table, she oiled up her hands, and began a delightful massage of my penis, giving particular attention to my glans, continuing to massage it vigorously after I ejaculated, something which I particularly like.

Then I lay fact down on the table and she began to massage my legs with long strokes, with plenty of touching of my balls.  During the massage she was quite chatty on health-related topics, giving me advice on my diet (which of course is her main line of work).  She also likes to talk about her life and her family.  After I turned over she massaged up and down my body, brushing against my penis with almost every stroke.  At the end, without my prompting her, she began massaging my penis for a second time, resulting in a delightful orgasm which somewhat surprised me, since I thought that at my advanced age I would no longer be capable of a second ejaculation after only some 55 minutes or so.

Usually after my massages with Charlotte we would have a bit of a chat, but on this occasion her next client arrived almost immediately, and I had to leave quickly.  She seems to be actually quite busy, so it would appear that there is a goodly number of men who like very mature women.

Charlotte is a very friendly person, who has a very free attitude, probably due to her French origin.  She has no hang-ups about the male body, but she does have her boundaries, which she insists on maintaining in order to keep her professional status and differentiate herself from sex-workers.  Thus, she will perform the massage nude, and she will absolutely not do oral or sex.  Do not try to push her.

When you go to her for the first time, just ask her for hand relief.  She will charge an unspecified fee, which she says she donates to the Westmead Children's Hospital.  She does not like to name a price, but I give her an extra $20 in addition to the $60 for the massage.  I know she does donate some of that extra, since she displays a receipt from the hospital for a regular donation of $400 from "Charlotte-------- and friends", but she probably keeps some of it for herself, which I think is fair enough.  On this occasion I gave her $80, and she put the $10 note into the donations box that she keeps.

In summary, I very much like the service Charlotte provides, and I think it well worth the relatively low price.

Nice review Paunchy. 

Just to clarify

At the top of your review you say 'under no circumstances will she be nude' but at the end of the review you say 'she will perform the massage nude'

I assume this was a typo?

Thanks for sharing paunchy,


I am also interested in getting a health related massage by a mature professional - she could be like a older sister to me only..............lol

There are a couple of MLs I know who could provide a similar services, but because they work in RnT shops and do offer the nude titty plays, so it was very hard to  Not give in for the more sexual plays - Coco, Candy, Lisa (Hong Kong) would be in those categories, but if someone who is strictly no nude, no touching but very good in her skills - which could be another huge turn on in its own way - basically it's like going to a strictly legit shop but you can take your pants off and in the end, she gives you a healthy release - that's just gold !!  Isn't that just what RnT is really all about ??

I did come across someone similar to your experience a long time ago, her name was Susan, a mature Chinese lady who was a chinese herbal/massage doctor - absolutely no sexual desires towards her - and her was not nude and no touches what so ever, I found out about her from another forum and the catches was: she gave an excellent remedial massage and in the end, she will give you a free hand release if you wanted - nothing to lose right so I gave her a try, well, in fact a few tries, so who could resist a free HJ right ??

She has a shop on the top floor of the NAB build in George Street Chinatown, she advertised herself as someone who could help and fix man with impotent and erectile problems - not that I had any of those, not today and certainly not 15 years ago.

Cut the long story short, first time I saw her, pay the $60/hr massage fees and lay on the massage table fully naked, she did the part 1 very professionally and at the 40/45 min mark she told me to turn over and continue to massage all the sensual area around the groin and pubic areas. of course, I had responded to the simulations even though there was no touching of cock and balls yet, I suppose this is part of her treatment, if man responded like me, then she would like offer a hand job release, and if the man is still a dead snail, then perhaps she would give a more direct stimulation, but I guess I would never found out as I had no problem getting up. I clear remembered what she said at the time: you are very strong, you don't have any problem, I said I know, she then asked: do you want to ejaculate out ? I said, yes please !

She then re confirmed that I can not touch her whatsoever, then applied some oil on my cock and gave a very enjoyable hand job, not the best by any means and she didn't hold back or slow down as I was getting close, so it was a kind of quickie ! well, what do you expect for a free handy. 

I saw her a few more times before the novelty wears off, well, I really can't go on too long without having a naked body or playing with some big tits when I cum, so, I enjoyed a few times but eventually the sensual and big tits desires had taken over, and that's the end of seeing Susan and I believe her shop was closed not long after - may be she wasn't getting enough business, but it was kind of good while I had it.

Cheers

Yes, it was a typo.  I meant to say she will NOT perform the massage nude.  I have been caught out before when I have carelessly left out the "not", giving the opposite meaning of what I wanted to give.

Hello Lungor,

I remember that back in the late 90s Chinese massage was very much the way you describe your session with Susan.  There was only a handful of providers, who were all mature women, obviously fully trained in traditional Chinese massage, who gave an excellent therapeutic massage with a hand release at the end for no extra cost.  Apparently they regarded the release as simply part of the massage, which I understand is part of the Chinese tradition.

The rot started when the original masseuses started hiring staff, often illegal immigrants whom they shipped in from China.  It was the hired staff who started charging extra for the hand job, probably because that was the only money they got, the mamasan keeping the base price for herself.  That way the original masseuse could get the same money as before without actually having to do the massage herself.  And of course in most cases the hired staff had no idea how to give a proper massage.

I have observed the progression over the last 15-20 years or so. Initially the hand job was included in the base price, and the massage was given by the owner.  Then the hand job began to be charged for as an extra, usually $20.  Finally additional extras, such as nude and touching, began to be offered and charged for accordingly.  I can remember my first massage at the Chinese place in East Row in Eastwood, many year ago, when I was not charged extra for the hand job; now it offers nude hand relief for $50.

I find that development a bit of a shame, since I always preferred a hand job as an integral part of a genuine massage by a trained masseuse, as opposed to a so-so rub as a mere prelude to a sexual service of whatever kind.

Thanks for your review. Do you think she would give the same to a new customer? Or do you think your service is due to your history with her?

Hello Milfaddict.

Charlotte's ad in the "Parramatta Advertiser" includes the notation "No sex", which as I understand it is code meaning the provider gives hand relief but does not do full service.  So I think she will give you a handjob on your first visit if you ask her nicely, but it would not be wise to ask for anything more.

I might say that I did not get a tug until after I had been to her four or five times, but that was due to my own timidity rather than to any reluctance on her part.  When I arrived at her house in Toongabbie for my first appointment way back in the mid 90s, I noticed the sign on her wall saying that she was a weight-loss specialist.  That and the fact she was wearing a white coat and the massage room was stacked with Herbalife products suggested to me that her service might be a straight massage.  On the other hand, the fact that she allowed me to be fully naked on the table, and did not cover me at all, suggested otherwise.

At the end of the massage she asked "Are you satisfied with that?"  Foolishly, I said "yes", so that was the end of that.  Subsequently, I realised that she was opening the way for me to ask for hand relief, but at the time I was too timid to ask, given the legit appearance of the place.  After all, a legit masseuse could ask the same question, simply enquiring whether I had enjoyed the massage.

Something similar happened the second time.  At the end of the massage she asked "Are you completely relaxed? No?".  Again an obvious hint, but again I was too timid to suggest that I needed more, even though I desperately wanted to.  The next two or three times I had a massage from her, there were no further hints, and no suggestive touching.  I guess she had me pegged as someone who wanted a straight massage only.

When I finally got a handjob, on about my fifth visit to her if I remember rightly, it was entirely on her initiative, without my asking.  I noticed that her massage had become more intimate, with her hands brushing my penis as they moved up and down my legs.  Then, at the end of the massage, she abruptly took hold of my penis, looked at me and barked, in a peremptory tone of voice, "Yes?".  I sheepishly nodded, and she proceeded to give me a very vigorous tug with lots of intense rubbing of the glans, which she continued for some time after I ejaculated, something I particularly enjoy.

From then on, there was no problem, and she gave me hand relief with every massage.  I do not why she decided to take the initiative and almost impose the handjob on me.  It cannot have been for money, since she did not charge any extra over an above the base price, which at that time was $40 for the hour.  I can only think that it came from her health-based perspective, from the concept that for a man to be healthy he needs to ejaculate regularly, and she saw her massage as serving that requirement.  In her massage room she used to have on the wall a poster about prostate cancer and the need to maintain prostate health in order to avoid it; it way well be that she viewed giving her clients hand relief as a way of helping them to avoid prostate cancer.

After I had been to her several times, I plucked up the courage to ask her if she would give me hand relief twice in the massage.  She looked at me quizzically and asked how I envisaged that.  I asked if she would give me the first one at the beginning while I stood, and the second one at the end as normal.  She just said "If that's what you want", and proceeded as I had asked.  From then on she routinely gave me a handjob at the beginning of each massage, without my asking, and a second one at the end.

The next step in my association with her was to ask if she would give me three handjobs in the session (I did so because I masseuse I had seen in my hometown Canberra had described to me how one of her clients had ejaculated three times in an hour, at the beginning, halfway through, and at the end).  Charlotte just seemed amused and said, "Breakfast, lunch and tea, all at once".  I gained the feeling that she did not find my request unusual, and that she may well be used to giving three or more handjobs per session to some of her other clients.  She is French after all!

So we started the session.  She gave me the usual standing handjob at the beginning, and then when I turned over she asked if I wanted the second one at that point.  I was feeling quite recovered from the first handjob, so I received the second one then and was able to ejaculate without any problem.  However, after two ejaculations I was feeling quite drained, so when we got to the end of the massage I did no bother to ask for a third.  So in subsequent sessions I just had the normal two handjobs.

As I wrote in my first post, I continued seeing Charlotte fairly regularly until about 2009-2010, after which I did not see her again until the middle of last year, when I found out she was still operating.  When she saw me she recognised me, and was obviously pleased to see me again.  She agreed that it must have been over 6 years since I had last been to her, since I did not know that she had moved from Parramatta to Northmead, which had occurred some 6 years ago.

On my first visit to her last year, she did something she had never done before, namely to cover me with a towel, which made me wonder whether she had changed her service.  I can only think that that must be a practice that she has adopted with first-time clients, and that she did it with me because I had not been to her for such a long time, and she may have been unsure as to what I wanted.  However,  after I turned over there was plenty of the accustomed brushing of my penis, so toward the end I reminded her that she used to give me hand-relief.  She just laughed, and told me that she now charged a fee of an unspecified amount that she donated to the Westmead Children's Hospital.  Her base fee is $60 for the hour, so I gave her the standard tug-fee of $20.  It may be that she would be satisfied with $10, but she might consider you a cheapskate.

In summary, I would suggest that if you call her you simply ask whether she gives hand relief.  I do not think she will be offended since that is what her ad clearly implies, but you should not ask for anything more than that; I have heard her on the phone giving short shrift to callers who have presumably done just that.  It also might not be a good idea to ask her for more than one handjob until after you have seen her a number of times and established a rapport.

I might say that I have always enjoyed going to Charlotte more than to the average R&T place.  I suppose that is because I find it thrilling to receive a handjob from someone who does not appear like a stereotypical sex worker, whereas at the typical R&T joint you know what you are going to get, so there is no thrill of anticipation.  Furthermore, Charlotte, although very friendly, is a rather dominant, no-nonsense person in a Continental sort of way, which is something that I rather like in a woman.

I trust my comments will be helpful to you.

Ooh la la! Great review(s), paunchy. A bit out of the way for me but sounds worth it for something different. Totally agree with: 'I find it thrilling to receive a handjob from someone who does not appear like a stereotypical sex worker, whereas at the typical R&T joint you know what you are going to get, so there is no thrill of anticipation.'

Thanks! I saw Charlotte about 20y ago at Toongabbie and enjoyed the same style of experience. Her accent particularly aroused me and I didn't know if she still offered her massage service? I recall she sold Avon products back then too. 
I'll have an opportunity to go to her area in late March so she'll definitely be in my priority list.

Person's Name : Charlotte

Establishment : Private Northmead but GPS prefers Baulkham Hills

Date of Visit : 21 May 17

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0418 493 111

Hours of Business : Reasonable I suspect I saw on a Sunday morning

Rates : $60/hr  + donation for a slippery nice 2 handed tug

Age : Mature ...a guess late 50's

Size/shape : Short not fat but middle aged spread (this isn't relevant as she remains clothed and you wont touch)

Nationality or Ethnicity : French

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : For the massage yes and the tug can be had for a charity donation.

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.) Very easy to contact and book. Intelligent woman with some typical no nonsense french humour I liked. She does like to tell her story and get yours...but she isnt setting up to rob you, just being friendly. She showed me to her room (set up as professional massage studio) I stripped and she started her massage on the back of my legs, I became aroused and told her, we had a small conversation where it was agreed I could relax more if she took care of that arousal. I flipped she oiled me up and gave a nice tug, using both hands including all the tackle, but very clearly indicated I could put a hand on her hip but no more. After the release I flipped back for a massage, it was good in technique but I felt it was a little "weak/soft" After turning over she massaged the front finishing on my stomach, when she announced she was done I hinted maybe not. She asked if I wanted to go again, she said as long as you dont take too long..LOL, must have had a follow on booking.
After the second clean up as I dressed she went to get me some water then we negotiated the tip...it was at my discretion as she gave it to charity, the lady has a saintly virtue in this regard IMHO. I gave her an extra $20 anything less for 2 shots would have been rude.

Enjoy if this service appeals to you.

I re-read Paunchy's report and given her abrupt demeanour Charlotte fits the bill. Would she think I am a pervert if I requested she abuse me in French as well? I just want to respect her boundaries and she doesn't seem to be a hardcore sexworker. This will actually be the first time I have visited a tugshop so please excuse the naivety of my questions.

Person's Name : Charlotte

Establishment : Private Northmead 

Date of Visit : 13 July 17

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0418 493 111

Hours of Business : From about 10 AM to 7 PM.

Rates : $60/hr + donation for HJ, usually $20.

Age : 75, born in 1942

Size/shape : Short, middle-aged spread 

Nationality or Ethnicity : French

Services Provided : Massage plus HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Generally yes, given  the relatively low cost

My experience/comments:

At the outset I have to say that on balance my experience was negative, compared with my earlier visits to her.  On this occasion, she seemed to be less enthusiastic than usual about doing the penis massage, and seemed to regard it as a bit of an imposition.

At first, things followed the normal pattern.  She welcomed me on arrival, and we had the usual chat about her life, before repairing to her massage room. However, she asked me to lie down and get under a towel which she placed on the table.  This was new development, since on previous occasions she never covered me. Following my usual modus operandi, I asked to massage my penis at the beginning while I remained standing.  She complied with my request, but seemed rather reluctant. She massaged my penis for probably less than 5 minutes, until I ejaculated, rather weakly as usual. Charlotte gave a reproachful look, and said "That was not much for such a lot of hard work".  

Who does she think I am, Peter North?  I have been mocked before by masseuse for the paucity of my ejaculation, but this was the first time Charlotte had done so.  Anyway, I lay down on the massage table and the massage began.  The massage was the same as usual, with plenty of touching of my balls as she massaged up my thighs.  After turning over, there was the usual brushing of my penis as she massaged my legs and my stomach, keeping me hard.

As we neared the end, she began fondling the tip of my penis.  But then, she suddenly said, in a very determined tone, "That's it, massage over".  What the fuck!  Normally at this stage she would automatically start massaging my penis again, but she just patted my stiff penis and said "Go to sleep".  It was obvious that she did not want to give me a second hand job, so I did not ask, thinking that she might get annoyed.

I do not know why she so adamantly declined to massage my penis the second time, whereas previously she had always done so without any prompting.  Perhaps she thought not worth her while to put effort into inducing a "trickling stream of lukewarm cream", as it is put in the Ballad of Eskimo Nell.  Whatever the reason, it was a great disappointment for me, as I was feeling like a second round.

Another negative feature was that her conversation during and after the massage consisted largely of a litany of complaints about her neighbours, the local government, and the police.  It seems she has a real talent for getting herself into trouble with her environment.  It became obvious why; she boasted about how she used to report her neighbours to the Council for minor misdemeanours such as not cleaning up their front lawns. Such behaviour is obviously not going to make her popular.

On the way out she gave me some lemons from her tree.  That was a nice touch, but it did not make up for the disappointing nature of the session.  I am not sure whether I would return; I got the impression that she wanted to cut back on the service she was giving me.  But I would not want to discourage the rest of you from trying her out; perhaps those of you who ejaculate powerfully might get a better reception.

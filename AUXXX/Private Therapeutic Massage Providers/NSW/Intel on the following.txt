Hi guys,

As some will know I have TOFFT a few times, and given details on to other punters who have then reviewed ladies I hadn't reviewed yet. I have three potential masseuses I want to try, but before I TOFFT I was wondering whether anyone had any intel on them (all of these are from gumtree)

- Sky, English Masseuse, Potts Point - 0467 647488 - her ad does say "STRICTLY NOT SEXUAL SERVICE"...however I have been informed she does charge a hefty premium for a sensual massage
- Jasmine, Miracle Massage Lady, Strathfield - 0423 373 174
- Suzanne - Chipping Norton - 0428 227 909

The last two do allow you to be nude for the massage.

Sorry wachumba, I posted it off my phone, so was hard to get the links working. I will have a look on gumtree today and post the links.

Yes Jasmine also provides Gypsy services. But on speaking with her on the phone she was very clear with me that the massage could be done with me completely nude hence why I think more might be on offer. I have tried to google things to do with her but haven't been able to find anything.

Can a mod please update my first post with links?

I haven't tried Jasmine although I remember speaking to her a while back - she advised she did a very sensual massage and I got the impression she would do hr, though I never got around to booking her.

Suzanne provided hand relief at the end of my massage with her - she charged me a total of $60 for the hour. okay service but wouldn't really go out of my way again, and she works from a workshed with many loud tradies and machinery in adjoining factory sheds. I didn't have to ask her for hand relief, I just nuded up and on the flip she got straight to work after some quick legs and stomach massaging. she does appear to be late 50's, and she didn't ask for any extra money after we 

sky does a therapeutic session and then hand relief if you use her number on gumtree, though she isn't nude. I think she charged me $80 for this service for the hour, this was mid last year. I booked her under her gumtree number, it seemed very legit though she happily got to work on the turn after noticing my large boner popping out of the top of the towel :-). she also advertised on cracker previously as electra I think it was, in which she provides a full body massage with body slides and hr etc - I think she charged me $130 for an hour, I tried this service with her in 2014. She didn't noticed me on the return visit when I booked her as sky. I remember her though because she leaves her apartment door open in a dodgy looking apartment complex near kings cross. The therapeutic with hr for $80 IMO would be worth it every other week, but I see from the link provided it is now $100. Maybe worth a try once and see if you like it. she does have good hands and is okay looking

Chilli and Suzie (both MLs offer happy endings in Canberra) instantly come to mind. Both pretty out there in terms of what they're into but I don't mind the occasional indoctrination attempt, can be fascinating just how different some people's take on the world and where it's headed is.

I usually get a good feeling too...and when I had called her she seemed very open about letting me be naked for the massage and that she'd be very sensual etc...but yes i think that voice sounds about right with a slight accent..maybe Italian. Not a strong accent, just the accent of one who knows two languages but has lived here for a very long time.

Maybe one day someone will get a massage from her and we will see a review. At this rate we might get one review a year if that

I saw Electra/sky about 10 months ago. Agree it was a dodgy apartment but service was great. Booked for 2 hrs as I was up there on business and had nothing else to do 😉. Started with very sexy lap dance ending with first cum, followed by good massage on table with b2b (including reverse), DATY and second cum. She also finished with helping me get the oil off in the shower. Overall great service, sexy accent, athletic build size 12-14 but sexy and mutually enjoyable service. Recommend!!

I have updates on the women in the original post. I have been turned off posting reviews in here lately but may post one soon. Sky/Electra does indeed provide a GREAT service and she is very sexy, however it is a little pricey. She is also notoriously hard to nail down for first timers, she doesn't like to take any crap and if you don't communicate with her exactly as she wants, you won't get a booking. I know of a couple of members on here that have failed.

Jasmine, well, I just keep trying for the sake of it now but she probably will never take a booking from anyone. She either won't answer calls, or will text back with her availability and then not answer when trying to make the booking.

Suzanne was a nice massage, not much else

I think "Suzanne" might be the same person who until about halfway last year was advertising on Gumtree as energy massage in Chipping Norton, but under the name Taylor.

I tried to make a booking with her early last year.  When I rang her she answered, and her voice sounded oldish; she was quick to warn me that her massage was not remedial but was an all-over relaxing massage.  I must have sounded like an old bloke who was after a remedial massage!

Anyway, I suggested a time later in the day, but she said she had to go to the hospital, and did not know whether she would be back in time; she would message me later to let me know.  About 30 minutes before the time I had suggested, she messages me saying she could not so the massage.

A few months later, I texted her asking if she still did massage, which she affirmed.  But when I tried to make a booking, she said she was in Melbourne at the moment, and would let me know when she got back.

I never heard back from her.  I did text her a couple of times asking if she was still in Melbourne, and the answer was always yes.

She sounds very unreliable.  Maybe she just does not want to see me for some reason.

 Its a Miracle
				
Post Content: 
Jasmine 'Miracle Massage Lady' Gypsy etc etc is actually an old Mediterranean Lady ( Italian or Greek) who did a crap massage with the table against the wall as she molested you.🙀

Frances is her name and she used to operate out of her home in Coronation Parade South Strathfield. She used to pop her tits out as she pulled your cock. She was cheap and not qualified at massage. She is or was a smoker. 

She was not someone you would ask for any extras unless you were into old smelly peticoated grannies.

She was someone who you after looking around would be planning your escape route or wondering wtf you were doing there. Needless to say back in the day there were few PML's around so when you had forgotten how bad they were and recognised how foolish you were when you dropped your pants to get molested again well, sometimes you forget the lessons you learned and need to learn again. 

Frances was actually a licensed Private Investigator. Clearly not much chop at that. 

Gumshoe to Gunscrew she ain't.

Funny as. If you now have a sudden feeling of de ja vous feel free to state aha oh no not her.
Certain she has likely pulled a lot of cock in her day. Now she sold her house in the first quarter of 2016. 
This may go some way to explain the evasiveness of Jasmine Frances.Don't know she needs to work anymore but retirement or death awaits many of us but I have a feeling she likes seeing cock so those who dare may one day get to meet the Miracle Massage Lady.

Don't say you were not warned.

Now Sparksy it wasn't you it was her. Franca Francis Jasmine Miracle Massage Lady she was preoccupied with the biggest stress that we all know. She was busy selling her house moving arranging loans and shifting belongings and cash as the exchanges didn't line up exactly.
Clearly she was preoccupied with thoughts of this that the other but not clients old new potential...

The months were 2016 May and June she bought a property for just over $600k and sold her old house for $1M plus change. Her nest egg and superannuation now sorted she really doesn't need the money so if you wish to spend your time chasing her I am sure you could compound your perceived disappointment with some real disappointment...

So if you read the thread in Silver I will find a way to give you the intel required if you wish to lose your GSOH ...

No charge for the laughs...

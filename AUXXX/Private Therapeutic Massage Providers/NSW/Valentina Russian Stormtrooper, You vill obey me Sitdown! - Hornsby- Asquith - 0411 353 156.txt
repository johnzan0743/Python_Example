 Valentina Russian Stormtrooper, You vill obey me Sitdown! - Hornsby/ Asquith - 0411 353 156
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Val or Valentina

Establishment : PML

Date of Visit : September 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Cumberland Newspapers Hornsby Edition. 0411 353 156

Hours of Business : 10 am to 7pm by appointment 7 days

Rates : $60 per hour

Age : 59

Size/shape : six foot one inch tall stormtrooper 'D'Cups but need a stool to see them. She wears heels.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Russian Ex Commie Block Zsaress

Services Provided :Remedial or Relaxation Massage only

Value for money/recommend? : Great massage yes but no extras zip.

My experience/comments :

Val advertises in the Health and Beauty section of the local paper.
I had seen her a couple of years ago and thought to myself I would pay her another visit and try her massage again.

She answers her mobile if she is not busy making an appointment is easy. Address issued and go to back of house in suburbia. Deep breaath in and hold as they are working on the paintwork at the house. Val lives and works aaround the back of the house.
greeting you is not a probalem. She has a sharp memory. She is rather tall for a woman. She stands well over 6 foot in bare feet and with heels towers in the doorway. Shows me into the massage room. She had moved since the last time I saw her. She has piercing blue eyes and a no nonsense attitude. She has blonde hair. probably out of a bottle but if you see her don't even think that. This woman is seriously scary. Her death stare was installed in the Russian front in war in Afghanistan I am certain.

Undress onto table. She does a number of really strong techniques. Not for the faint-hearted. She starts off by doing stretches. She doesn't worry if you are nude but just don't ask her to touch your goolies. She will likely throw you out the door without opening it. She is super strong.
The massage is a really strong one and whilst it could be more relaxing if she suspects you want something else well let me just set you straight here. You will be in pain bigtime. She does use all of her muscles to impart an extreme workout on every sinew in your body. she manipulates your legs and torso in ways you shouldn't think about. Nothing sensual about the massage whatsoever save for the payment at the end where she says thank you.

Now she does do a really great massage and I figured that if someone was in need of a strong massage they would really enjoy Val.
She loves black and usually wears a black pants suit. I know retro, but I for one am not about to be giving her fashion advice.

Now I am uncertain if she can be tamed. Probably not. The upper north shore boys have possibly tried and failed. But hey I would imagine she would be really great at the tug providing you brought your own doggie bag to put your penis in after she finished with it.

I imagine that if she were hard up for cash she may be persuaded. But would i take the chance in asking her again. Nu uh no way zip nada ooohhh just sends a chill up my spine those eyes.aaarrrggghhhh!!!

Phew I woke up and guess what it was only a dre what tha fu!!!#*%

Got to stop being impulsive.

WIR Well I have for a decent massage but only when I have the courage!

VFM yes as long as you are happy with massage only. She is Val 4 the money! ha!

Perhaps it is just me but if anyone else has seen Val she has been around for years please feel free to review her.

Good strong massage done by an amazon. Not particularly good looking but not bad either.

Happy punting.

Hey Biggus

See my review below dated 2011 +/-

(I ended up in St Ives looking for some relief after TOFTT in Hornsby. I was feeling like a good massage yesturday and as I was in Hornsby thought I'd try someone different. Local paper and Val's name jumped out, a PML. Turned up to be greeted by a big older Russian lady. Gave me a pretty good massage but dispite the flag pole on turn over nothing more on offer.

So it was back to St Ives and the delightful Eva. Went for the 30 minutes for $40 and opted for the slow tease as I had already had a massage.

Off with her clothes and a delightful half hour spent with some mutual teasing and fingering. Unfortunately Eva had the phone so interupted a couple of times by some of you unthoughtful punters ringing for appointments.....
Other than that a well spent extra $40 for the time, )

Yes JB,  we should be given medals for bravery. Indeed taking one for the team has a totally different meaning when being frightened by Valentina.

Great massage but nuttin sens you all about it but she does give you a workout.

Cannot figure out why she is still working without a net. She is seriously stern looking. I think she enjoys teasing the boys since she was given her discharge papers from the KGB!

I've tried this lady also, and can vouch for biggus, stare is definitely cold and icey, and I had no chance for a fun ending, maybe if you were a regular.

she did remove the tiny towel she placed on my front towards the end, leaving me very exposed, but simply continued with the massage with a few accidentals here and there.

she may be tamable lol

Hey Mikey did you actually attend to the Ruskie after reading the post here? Or perhaps the fright you received was in a previous life before they issued stun guns and cap spray?

I hope I did not encourage your brave foolishness in a challenge against the odds. If I did you have my sincerest apologies. Let me know and i will pay for your trauma counselling services.

I have to agree it is very scary if you have any thoughts about asking for anything sensual. Why you would is beyond me. I was simply out of my mind at the time of my second visit. Come to think of it I probably was out of it the first time.

Good luck gentlemen. I'll buy you some absolut Vodka if you manage to penetrate the KGB agent Valentina. You will need it!     

That is all.

Yes of course it comes from the German words Sturmtruppen. So the pedant in you is partially but not completely correct. The tactic of Storming was used  by the Russians in June 1916 in a larger scale. The Germans coined the phrase along with a number of other tactics but "Storm" troopers are not an exclusive device or description used by the Germans only. Metaphorically speaking I used it with Valentia because it was more appropriate than using terrorist or indeed zombie like. But that is just me conservative in language.

Anyway best of luck. Suggest you 'emp' loy all of your charms. That and nikes work best I find. I would say it might be a fair match. But I would only be giving you false hopes. Bon chance. Remember Hornsby Hospital is just up the road if you need the paddles!

I used to see this lady years ago for some back and hip issues. I am one of the north shore boys as mentioned by Biggus and I tried and failed!! She used to do o/c which suited me perfectly and I had had quite a number of sessions with her. She gives an incredibly good massage however I did make the mistake of asking for extras one time when I was in a state of arousal - not a good move. The next massage after that one was my last with her. Suffice to say I was hurting for a few days afterwards! I still have some soft tissue damage I think and it has been about 5yrs! The upside is that because she doesn't come across (or never did for me anyway) the soft tissue damage isn't in the little bloke.

I was procrastinating the other week and reading old threads on AUXXX. Anyways, I came across this thread and phoned (from a private number) Valentina and asked her how much for a massage. She sounded extremely chirpy (I was expecting a grumpy sounding woman) and she told me $70. Her chirpiness stuck in my mind and made me curious if extras were on offer, so I then phoned her a few days later (again, from a private number) and had the following conversation

Me: "How much for a massage please?"
Val: "$70."
Me: "Do you mind if I have it un-draped?"
Val: "Laughter* "You have to have it with no clothes on so you don't get oil on your clothes."
Me: "I know I need no clothes on. But I also mean un-draped. Naked. This means with nothing covering me."
Val: *Laughing* "Of course."
Pause.
Me: "Do you mind if I relieve myself at the end?"
Val: "Well, you'll have to pay me."
Me: "How does $20 sound?"
Val: "Sure."
Me: "Will you watch?"
Val: *Laughing* "Sure."

So it seems she has loosened up a bit. I haven't gone for the massage yet as I haven't had time to get over north side. I'll try in the next week or two. I just thought I'd put this info out there for people.

 Valentina (massage) - 0411 353 156 - Hornsby, NSW
				
Post Content: 
TL;DR - I should've taken fartichoke's advice in this thread and given Valentina a miss. She wasn't bad, just nothing exceptional.

Anyways, here's the review.

Person's name: Valentina.

Establishment: Private suburban residence in Hornsby. 10 minute walk from Hornsby train station.

Date of visit: September 2014.

Contact details: 0411 353 156; truelocal ad, here.

Hours of business: Contact Valentina.

Rates: $60 for therapeutic massage before 10am, $70 after 10am. I don't think she offers health fund rebates (I'm not certain on this though).

Age: Early-60s.

Size/shape: Short curly blonde hair, 5'11"-6' tall, dress size 12-14, big floppy titties that she (accidently?) rubs up against you.

Nationality: She is from Russia (or some former Soviet State) originally. Although I think she has lived in Australia for a while.

Services provided. Professional massage. You can stroke yourself at the end but she leaves the room.

Value for money: No. Run of the mill massage. If you live in Hornsby and want a massage, by all means visit her. But there is no need to go out of your way if you do not live near Hornsby.

My experience/comments: Straight off the bat, I must mention I wanted a good massage. I knew from previous phone conversations with her I could have the massage un-draped and probably even stroke myself at the end (with her maybe watching). But, most importantly a good massage was my priority - she delivered on that, but it was nothing exceptional.

Making a booking via telephone was very easy. She fitted me in on short notice. I also don't understand "biggusdickus" (or however he spelled his name) comments on her being a 'storm trooper'. She was very laid back and had quite a dry sense of humour (which I can appreciate).

I walk to her residence from Hornsby train station. As I said, easy enough and only 10 minutes away. You have to enter around the back (although I think it is her residence, she mustn't like dudes walking through her home). It's not a well maintained house and a the backyard was a bit messy, but whatever, doesn't bother me and I'm not a judge on The Block

I wasn't offered a shower, just told to strip and jump on the table. About 5 minutes into the massage an elderly gentleman with a walking stick walked around into the backyard (you are on a table in the backroom, sliding doors open, facing the backyard) and she had to shoo him away and tell him to come back in an hour. It was a bit of a wtf? moment which I thought was funny.

I placed my dick pointing down but there was no accidental brushing. She did brush her tits over me a fair bit though (I don't know whether this was accidental or not). The titty brushing got me pretty riled up but I fought off the urge to try and take things further (I'm a scumbag, but a gentlemanly scumbag, I didn't want to offend her).

I flip over and have got a raging hard-on. She didn't brush it but when there was five minutes to go she told me and smiled nodding to my dick. I pointed to it and asked "do you mind if I take care of this." She said sure, I'll leave the room. I asked her if she wanted to stay and watch, but she said no (although I do know from previous phone conversations if you pay her she'll stay and watch, but I'm not going to pay someone to watch me jerk off).

She leaves the room and I bust my nut. Boom. All done.

The funniest thing about the whole experience is she had this incredibly cheesy 1980s porn music playing loudly on the stereo system in the massage room. I felt like I was in the 1983 film Scarface - it was that type of music. Think Cuban drug lords in 1980s Miami. Anyways, I was dying to know who the band was and she told me it was Supermax, their music can be found here lol.

It was a decent massage, but wasn't worth my effort to travel to Hornsby to get it. Nice lady, nice massage, but I won't be back. I've ticked her off my list and will try something new out.

A hand-job may be on offer with return visits/if she fancies you - who knows? I'd say a 50/50 chance.

Thanks for reading!

Bronze members cannot access the Therapeutic Massage Parlour section, but they can access all others (PML, PWL, Establishments).

In this case, it makes no differences. All members can read this review (of a PML) whether it's in Bronze or in the PML section.

I have seen Valentina twice, the first time for an hour in 2010, the second time early last year for 90 minutes.  The charges were the same on both occasions, $70 for the hour, $100 for 90 minutes, and $130 for two hours.  She must be one of the very few who has not jacked up her process over the intervening six years.

I had seen her ad in the Hornsby Advocate several times and it intrigued me, although nothing about it was in any way suggestive.  I rang on a number of occasions but got no reply.  Eventually I texted, and got a response giving me the prices; I made an appointment for the next day and she gave me the address.

Her house in Hornsby is just as has been described in previous reviews; you have to go round the back and in the rear entrance.  On this first occasion her massage room was situated in a bedroom inside the house, and one entered through the laundry. Valentina was physically as described in the previous reviews, very tall and formidable-looking, but I actually found her quite attractive, rather like a dominatrix.  She welcomed me in a friendly manner, and there was nothing of the KGB storm-trooper about her (although she is Russian, she is actually from Latvia, and is a graduate of the University of Riga).  At the time I thought she may have been Scandinavian.

She took me into the massage room and left me there, without giving me any instructions as to the level of undressing or draping.  There were towels rolled up on the shelves, but none on the massage table.  Since I was trying to suss out her operation, I did not want to give any impression of being modest myself, so I decided to lie on the table nude without covering myself, and with my legs moderately apart, but not too much so.  My thinking was that if she did not immediately throw a towel over me, that might be an indication that all parts of my body would be included in the massage.

Valentina came in and did not show any hesitation or make any comment.  She left me uncovered, but took my legs and pushed them together rather roughly, which I interpreted as a sign of annoyance on her part.  The massage of my back proceeded; it was very firm and competent, and in no way sensuous, but nevertheless I became aroused.

Then it came time to turn over, which I thought would be the moment of truth, since I had a full erection.  I thought at best she would throw a towel over me, at worst get angry.  But no, she made no comment, and did not cover me, simply proceeding with the massage.  Later, when I found out she was Russian, I realised why my nudity had not made any impression on her, either positive or negative; she comes from a culture where mixed nudity in the bath-house (banya) is the norm.

Finally she stopped abruptly and said "finished" in a rather peremptory tone.  Lying naked and vulnerable on my back, with my erection pointing skywards, I plucked up the courage to ask whether she gave hand relief. "I do not!" she answered very firmly, in a tone of annoyance, and immediately left the room, leaving me alone to dress.  I dressed slowly and somewhat apprehensively, wondering what would happen when I went out and had to face her.  Should I apologise humbly, or just say nothing?

However, when I met her in the laundry to hand over the $70, she had reverted to being pleasant and cheerful  She thanked me with a smile, and without any signs of having been offended.  Perhaps that was because I had taken "no" for an answer without any argument.

In the intervening years I wondered whether it was worth trying to see her again.  I thought that if I left it for long enough, she would not remember me, and I could start afresh to establish a rapport with her without causing any offence.  I decided that under no circumstances should I again ask her for hand relief, but should just "go with the flow".

Eventually, early last year, I decided to give her a ring.  She answered and was very pleasant on the phone.  I adopted the pose of a newbie, asking questions about prices, the type of massage (of course not suggesting sensual); she answered that it was a professional therapeutic massage, and I was pleased and somewhat surprised to hear that her prices were still the same.  Then I asked her whether it was by appointment only, and her tone changed; she answered in a very abrupt manner, along the lines of "this is not an open house here, there are no walk-ins, you have to make an appointment".

I had the impression that she may have interpreted my query about appointments as the start of an attempt to suss out whether she operated like a massage parlour, something that she needed to stamp on immediately. She was right of course; I was trying to suss her out in an oblique way, to see whether her operation had become a bit more permissive over the last six years.

Her reaction leads me to doubt Cartman's account of his conversation with Valentina prior to his meeting her.  I simply cannot see her tolerating a suggestion from a complete stranger that she let him masturbate in her presence during or after the massage.  Nor can I imagine her pointing to his erection and inviting him to masturbate, albeit not in her presence.  I know that she tolerates a naked and undraped male customer having an erection in her presence, but I have the impression that is only if her attention is not drawn to it.

Anyway, a few weeks later I rang her and made a 90-minute appointment for the following day, not telling her that I had been before.  She was very pleasant on the phone, and texted me her address ( which I had forgotten anyway).  The next day I arrived at her house at midday, the allotted time, and went around the back as instructed.  Valentina was sitting at a garden table in a pergola which I did not remember from last time, wearing a black jumpsuit that revealed quite a lot of her nice breasts (the first time I visited her she was wearing blue casual clothes that were not at all sexy); she greeted me warmly, calling me "dollink" a number of times.  She took me into the massage room, a different one from last time; this new one was adjacent to the pergola, to which it was connected by a full-size glass sliding door, so not exactly private, since anyone who came into her backyard would be able to look into the room and see what was going on.  The idea that Valentina was seemingly unworried by the possibility that someone might catch a glimpse of her massaging a naked man was actually quite exciting.

She instructed me to undress, and then went out into the pergola and sat there, watching me begin to get my kit off.  Before I was completely undressed she got up and went into her house through the back door, but she almost immediately came back through the door leading from the interior of the house into massage room. That was unexpected; I still had my underpants on and was unsure what to do.  Bravely I shed them, straightened up, and stood naked in front of her for a moment.  She did not bat eye but just waved me to the massage table, again leaving me undraped.

This time I kept my legs close together when I lay down, so as not to give a bad impression, but she took hold of them an pulled them apart; obviously I had not given a bad impression! The massage began, and took much the same course as before, very firm and therapeutic, with a lot of pressure, which I actually like on my shoulders and back.  In the course of the massage to my back, she did something that I do not remember her having done in my first massage from her; she placed both hands on my upper buttocks and began a rocking movement, pushing my body back and forth on the massage table.  That caused my penis to rub against the towel I was lying on, which actually was quite stimulating, and I began to become aroused.  She continued this movement for a fair length of time, and it was starting to feel quite good; fortunately (?) she stopped before I became aroused to the point of ejaculation.

I did not give too much weight  to that action, since I have experienced it before in therapeutic massages, and know that it is a legitimate action.  Nevertheless, I wonder what I would have done if she had carried on to the point where I got close to ejaculation; would it have been better to ask her stop because I was becoming too aroused, or keep totally quiet and let it happen, hoping she would not notice?  Which would have been the less annoying for her?  However, it did not get that far, so that is a matter for speculation.

When I was on my back she again performed an action which I found very pleasant, but which I also know to be a legitimate part of a therapeutic massage; she cradled my head on her ample bosom and stretched my upper body by lifting my back off the table.  She also touched with her breasts a few times during the massage as she leaned over me; as we connoisseurs of massage know, that is something that is quite common in a normal massage, and while very pleasant is not meant to be erotic.

The end of the massage did not come as abruptly as on the first occasion, presumably because I had taken the 90-minute option, and there was quite a bit of gentle warm-down, including a facial massage.  At the end she helped to  sit up on the table and turn to face her, so she could massage my shoulders.  Then she helped me to stand up slowly, saying that I needed to recover, so we ended up standing facing each other for a couple of minutes.  It was quite a turn-on to be standing naked facing her with a full erection, with her smiling at me, but of course she was looking at my face, not at my penis.  Then she left me to get dressed.

After I finished dressing, I went out into the pergola, but Valentina was nowhere to be seen.  I went up the path to the backdoor and saw her in the entrance talking to a small dark man who looked a bit like a Gypsy.  She came down to me to get her $100, and was very friendly and chirpy, calling me "dollink" several times.  Then she said she would give me business her card, something she had not done on the first occasion.  The card was an old one, showing her former Baulkham Hills location which she told me to ignore.

The card is actually very interesting and rather stimulating.  The main feature is a photo of one of her big blue eyes, and contrary to what some previous reviews have said, the expression in the eye was not at all cold or intimidating, rather it had the "come-hither" look.  It is apparent that she is encouraging me to come back.

Valentina gave me a good-bye kiss, and I turned to walk back to my car.  As I was walking along the side of her house I heard some very nice guitar music, and as I passed the front I saw it was the Gypsy playing it, sitting on her front porch.  I presume he is her partner.

To sum, I attribute the greater warmth of Valentina's farewell to me on this second visit to the fact that I did not annoy her by asking for hand relief on my (ostensible) first visit.  I think I have established the beginnings of a rapport with her, and I intend to go back and see her again before too long.  Of course at no time will I ask her for anything "extra"; I will just wait to see what eventuates.

Paunchy one thing about punting YMMV. This is due to different people having different chemistries, personalities and can even come down other personal likes and dislikes.

So just because A had a good time will not mean necessarily that B will have one and vice versa.

Nothing wrong in writing your own experience which may have been different, we all have had varying ones with providers. However insinuation another members is telling lies is not acceptable.

Always remember this when making comments like you did about Cartman. Ex cathedra statements like that calling other member's reviews into doubt are not warranted.

I suggest you apologise to him and remember YMMV.

I realise that a provider may react differently to different clients, offering more to one she likes than to another.  I think though that in general that differentiation would usually only occur after the provider had actually met the client in person.

I had the experience of speaking to Valentina on the phone as someone she did not know, a potential client making an enquiry, and I know she seemed a bit annoyed by my question about it being an appointment-only situation, and answered quite severely, stressing very emphatically that what she offered was a totally professional massage and her situation was not an "open house".  As I wrote in my post, I think that was because she interpreted my question as the lead-up to an enquiry about "extras", which she wanted to cut short.

That is why I found it difficult to believe that if a total stranger, someone she had not met, rang her up and made a sexual suggestion, such as asking if she would watch while he relieved himself at the end of the massage, she would not be annoyed, indeed would be rather angry.

It may well be that Cartman has a very charming manner on the phone, and presumably also in person, and is able to get away with suggesting things of a sexual nature to a no-nonsense, rather proud person like Valentina, that would anger her if those suggestions came from the rest of us.  If that is the case, he is a lucky man indeed, someone to be envied.

However, I think it would be unfortunate if someone who read Cartman's review tried the same approach to Valentina and ended up incurring her severe displeasure.

When, on my first visit to Valentina I asked her at the end of the massage whether she did hand relief, she seemed annoyed and answered very brusquely in the negative.  I accept that it may be that she just did not like me as a person, but I rather had the impression that she would have reacted in the same way to any first-time client who was so presumptuous as to assume that she was the sort of person who would do something sexual.  She did not stay angry, probably because I did not compound the fault by doing something stupid like offering money; but she did not invite me back.

On my second visit, at least six years later, I did not make any sexual suggestions (although I did have an erection), and the massage ended in a far more friendly fashion, with her inviting me back and giving me her card.

In any case, I intend to visit her again sometime.  I will adopt the same approach as on my second visit and see what eventuates.  I do not think I will have the courage to make the sort of suggestions that Cartman said he did, since I obviously do not have whatever it is that he has.

Just to add to this, saw her ad in the Hornsby Advocate in the Adult section a few months ago. Thought things may have changed. Gave her a call enquiring on prices, then asked how much extras. Anoyance was clear but subsided when I explained her add was in the Adult section. She apologised said she would contact the paper....almost tempted to try anyhow.

I can commiserate with you.  Valentina reacts very curtly to the merest hint that a man contacting her is after extras, even if only an HJ.  I once asked her over the phone if her massage was by appointment only and it seemed to annoy her; obviously she interpreted that question as the lead in to an enquiry about extras.  But she  does do a very thorough remedial massage, if you are satisfied with that; just don't expect anything sensual.

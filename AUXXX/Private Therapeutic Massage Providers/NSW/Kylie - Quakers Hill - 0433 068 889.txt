 Kylie - Quakers Hill - 0433 068 889
				
Post Content: 
While seeing a mate at Blacktown lastweek, I took the time to visit a nice sounding Chinese lady at Quakers Hill who was advertising on Gumtree for massage, cupping etc.
So I decided to give it a try......

First up when ringing do  not ask about h/j or anything other then full body massage....She is very paranoid re council.
She is about 45 to 50 years old friendly and average looking.
When I arrived at the appointed time, she showed me through the house out the back and to a converted garage....I thought this was looking good and proceeded to take my gear off and lay on the table.
She asked if I had any problem areas and I replied no I just want a medium relaxing massage...OK she says and starts to massage my back and neck.....Pretty good, not the best but far from the worst.
Hands and arms done she moved onto my legs, and gave a reasonable sensual massage in my inner thighs which caused a blood rush to the old fella....Nice bum massage without any tackle tickle but still reasonably sensual.........
Turn over time. She proceeded to "just cover" the old fella with a little towel and massaged my chest area and abdomen while the old fella was swaying in the breeze...Inner thighs again and when it was at attention politely asked me if I would like it relieved.
I answered yep enthusiastically and she then proceeded to kneed my balls while rubbing the old fella and at the same time telling me this was medicinal anyway. I didn't argue.
As explosion time approached I stuck my hands inside her bra and fondled a pair of nice sized tits. Then whammo!!!
She wipes me down and I proceed to get dressed while she waited outside.
Then I pulled out my wallet and she said that would be $70 for the 45 minutes.
Overall I was happy and paid with no complaints.
But she insisted I say nothing about the h/j so if ringing be very discreet.

I have a feeling that if someone were to become a regular more might be on offer...just a feeling mind you.

Will I be going back? A bit too far for this lazy bastard but I may be tempted to see if my feelings were right about any more on offer.

In the mean time my advice, treat her with respect and be discreet. She is separated from her husband but has a school age daugther I sort of worked out with her broken English.

Chinese 45 to 50 years old, professional masseuse does do h/j and "maybe" other extras when one gets to  know here.

Based on Cusoons advice I went ans saw Kylie today. I have previously thought about it but because she was so careful on the phone I didn't bother. Over all a nice 1 hr of massage although the little room was very hot today and Kylie was sweating up a treat. On the flip she was massaging my stomach and groin area when junior stood to attention. Nice ball massage and an OK HJ followed whilst I whipped up her top and fondled her melons and tickled her nipples which made her laugh.
I blew she cleaned me up and $70 later I departed, nothing exceptional but better than OK so I would  return to see if any more is on offer although she would need to be comfortable with you. On another note when I arrived at the house a guy was leaving out the front door and seemed friendly enough as we had a few words, obviously a friend or partner.

Be discreet please as this is her only form of income

Sparksy

ps she told me she is 49yo

Kylie is still operating.
I was there a couple of weeks ago but messaged her first and asked if I could give her a massage. She messaged back "yes"
I arrived and had a 10 miniute rub from her and then said its your turn.
She stripped down to bra and panties and I started to massage her and gradually slipped the panties down around her knees....all the time she was offerring light resistance, but after fingering her pussy a bit the resistance eased.
I slipped one leg out of the panties and commenced to suck her pussy.....Nice smell and almost immediatly she started squirming about and had orgasamed in a few minutes.
Then the nerves set in and she quickly got up started raving on about council and got dressed, finished me off by hand after I tried in vane to slip  the old fella into her mouth.

Got to talking after we were both dressed and she said she would fuck but not there and offered to come to my place [which was/is out of the question.
I played along anyway and said I would ring in a week and give her my address. I even told her she would be fucking for two men which she also agreed to.
She has messaged me a few times since but I am not answering and probably won't be going back despite her pretty good massage and sweet smelling pussy.

I have just rung and although she did not answer [it is 0845hrs in the morning] the call went to her message bank.

N.B.
This woman is very very paranoid about council/police etc.....
As detailed in my last post, perhaps if a friendship was worked on more would be on offer....
I have managed to suck her on the pussy for a few minutes which brought her to orgasim rather quickly  but there was some protest and resistance.
BUT as also detailed she does fuck and has offered to see me and a friend together at my place near Belmore.
But that is not a goer, so if you manage to foster a friendship, and have a place to screw her, then yeah she will be in it.

This older chinese milf WILL FUCK!!!
But you need to get her to your own premises which is out of the question for me.
She has even offered [when I last visited her] to see me and a friend together.
A word of warning!
She has messaged me now on three occasions as follows..

"You want to give me massage?"

"Give me your address"

"When you come again?"

I don't think I will be seeing her again.

Person's Name : Kylie

Establishment : Private

Date of Visit : April

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0433 068 889

Hours of Business : I had an appointment around 7pm but she said she doesn't like doing late ones.

Rates : $80

Age : 50ish?

Size/shape : Size 10-12ish, B-C cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

Might break this down into bullet points
- One of the BEST massages I've had in a very very long time, she really knows what she is doing. (Think shes been around the massage game for a while).
- I had no tackle tickle or anything "erotic" during the massage. She covered up junior with a towel on the flip. I had to ask her for a handy which she was hesitant about but said okay with $20. The handy was very rough and rushed.
- When i pulled up a bunch of her neighbours across the road were sitting/standing on their front porch. When I left there were also some other neighbours the next house across both were eyeing me / staring at me. Little to no discretion on weekends, or after hours on weekdays. I was worried leaving my car parked outside. She works out of a house which doesn't offer the same level of discretion as ladies that work out of an apartment.
- This lady is paranoid (council and dodgy guys) she told me what the last guy in was doing / asking about and I'd be pretty worried as well.

Awesome for a good massage, wouldn't go any further with her? I can't believe someone went down on her lol....

Would I revisit? Only go on days I was at home from work during the day. i.e. 10AM-3PM when there aren't many people about. I'm 99% sure her neighbours think she is a hooker.

Had thought about a Kylie visit last last year but she was busy till the afternoon which didn't suit.  The Gumtree ad had gone and thought she may have stopped then I recently noticed more posts.

I noticed the Gumtree ad was back and there is also an ad in the legit massage section of the local paper.  I phoned and booked a visit with Kylie on 29/5.

Knocked on the front door and found that I was meant to have gone to the back which is all set up with a bench and the various massage certificates Kylie has attained.  She doesn't seem to be too secretive as the number in her ads is actually posted in her front window.

Kylie said she used to work in a friends massage business in Parramatta and was now trying to build up her own.  There is the usual signs of what services aren't provided and there is also a few hand written notes with the number for the local police.

Anyway as mentioned by others Kylie is friendly and gives a good massage.  She was wearing tight stretchy pants that seemed to emphasise her lips.  In the course of massage agreed to extend the 30 minutes and this was probably once I had started to rub her thighs.  Turnover time came and I maintained I had no more than the $50.  Ended up leaving a bit early after an HJ and getting Kylie's tits out which have nice nipples.  She likes to say no but didn't have a bra on and let me pull her top up - it was pretty cold.  She offers a receipt for health fund payment but was reluctant to leave my details for her filing system in the renovated garage.  If one was interested I am sure persistence would yield better results.

Person's Name : Kylie

Establishment : PML at Quakers Hill just a stones throw from QH Police Station.

Date of Visit : Sept 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Cumberland newspapers Massage Section 0433 068 889   Lovegrove Drive Quakers Hill

Hours of Business : 9am to 8 pm Seven days but actually by appt only.

Rates : 1hr massage $60 Detox/Lymph massage $80 hr Aromatherapy $70 hr Dry needling $40 30 mins  Beauty $60 facials $30 waxing Health Fund rebate receipts issued.

Age : 50

Size/shape : size 8 to 10 slim "B" cuppers.

Nationality or Ethnicity : MLC

Services Provided : Massage and tug $60

Value for money/recommend? : Average

My experience/comments : 

Looking to Confirm Cussoons comments so made a booking to see this CML. Also had some time to kill so decided I would check out this CML. Rang and made a booking for an evening session.

Arrived on time and went through the gate after parking in the recessed driveway. This is a no no. The street is narrow and has double lines which makes it illegal to park out on the street. Parking in the driveway is not something I am comfortable with but had little choice. Just be aware of this of you decide to sample this ladies massage.

Into the garage which has a room badly built badly fitted out badly designed but sufficient to fit a massage table in but only just. Now Kylie works at another job along with taking Engrish Grasses. Do not believe the story she spins about being very quiet and you my only cussomer today. She is FOS.

Especially as she recycles the cloth table covers. I had to request the cover was changed because it was oily and obviously had been used a few times. So Yukk!

To start. Now she uses cheap baby oil you know the really thick home brand variety. Not happy when I asked her to not use that oil. The co-efficient ratio of that oil does not allow for friction free cohesion with the skin. I.e. It hurts when you rub hard. This is not meant to happen. 

Having been around the block a time or two I pulled some almond based massage oil out of my manbag and offered it up for use on me. I usually carry it when I visit AML as they really don't care what they use on you for the most part. Some don't use any oil. 

I want to be able to enjoy the massage so the Scout Motto always comes in handy (So to speak!). 

Now her technique is not the best nor the worst massage I have had with a CML but I would not return based upon the massage alone. 

I had an hour booking and it progressed fairly quickly thank God. The pressure was not hard and not soft. There was nothing sensual about the massage.

But then I had not given any indication I wanted anything else. After 45 minutes on my front with my arms being manipulated to places and configurations they have never been before and are not meant to go I was asked to turn over.

What followed was a competant front massage. I had to close my eyes and, wait for it, think about the Gestapo to get an erection, well half a one.

This did not escape Kylies attention. She smiled and said I can look after him you know! Rhetorical question. I said Okay. So she applied a generous amount of almond oil to Mr Biggus and started to tug him like there was no tomorrow. 

I was about to say something but instead just shoved my hand down her pants and she squealed.
I then suggested she slow down and take her time as the friction burns would scar me for a week if she didn't. I don't think her Engrish was good enough to pick up on the joke but she did slow down. I was massaging her hairy bush. I decided that the best place my hand could go was to check out the tits.

Well prominent nipples but a "B" cuppers at best. She had elongated nipples found in women who have had children. From memory her mammories had a mole in between them but it might have been a bit of dirt. Or chocolate syrup. 

After around 10 minutes of me closing my eyes and feeling her up along with stimulating her clitorus I shot my load onto the wall behind the table. It had been a few days after all and the pipes were in need of a good clean.

So I was given some wipes to clean up along with tissues. She stuck them in a half full bin of tissues behind the table and then I realised she was full of shit with her earlier statement of me being the only customer that day. Either that or she is a hoarder. 

Kylie plays her violin and some guys fall for that. Having lived with a bunch of whingers I know what the story is and the ploy to garner sympathy does not work with me. If she was consistent she may be believable. That should not detract from the service she offers. Unfortunately it does.

Saying a story that makes no sense means rewarding people for whinging. I never do. So I asked for a receipt and gave her $60 only. No tip. 

If she was disappointed she didn't show this. Now a word of caution about Kylie. Ring her from your punting phone only. She is clueless about being discreet.  

She sent me multiple texts before I made the booking. I had phoned her with my mob number showing a couple of weeks ago. She sent me a number of texts and tried ringing the phone a couple of times. 
She is clueless about Ettiquette. So a word of warning to all who wish to sample her. 

Now WIR Probably not. Did she represent VFM barely. Would I root her. Short answer No! So I won't be back to see her anytime soon.

There may be more on offer as has been suggested. But not for this little black duck!  



Biggus.

OMG, BYO oil. I prefer talc since, like beetroot in portable food, oil usually applies itself to my clothes. 

The topic of what else you keep in your man-bag would probably start a useful thread in General Discussion.

Thank you for yet another useful and stimulating review.

Actually soluble massage oil is the best thing for us old guys skin. Baby Oil is great for babies or blokes with no brains but having a manbag that contains useful things like spare change for the parking meter, massage oil, condoms, kygel lubricant, and of course a supply of cock rings is essential part of the Motor Vehicle Toolkit supplies.

Not to mention Oxygen Bottle for that speshal punt oh and Nitrus Oxide for that laughable moment. Along with a ventolin inhaler and rescue remedy and Epipen as well as a few extra pineapples for those just in case punts!!!

mb you should read this thread to understand my reluctance to have these as a part of my Manbag toolkit.

http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f35/ou...-viagra-21236/

A salient story which proves the dangers of taking coloured pills is always an unknown fuckedher!    

Besides if the opportunity arises (so to speak) that you may get your end in the problem with taking the blue pillls is they can take up to around a half hour to work. The logistics of when to take them comes into play. So when do you take them? Before the massage can make an hour massage seem like torture. Lying on a raging boner is not the most comfortable thing. Now as for the massage it is a choice to option up from a massage rnt to full service. Most of us don't mind this but figure being pampered is what the massage is about. reason to avoid those who just want to get to the good bits without delay and get you off their table and out their door. Apologies didn't mean to get serious here.

will return to normal flippant programming after this commercial.


"Viagra a pill man can stand by" !!!

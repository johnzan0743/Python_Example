I think I know the woman you are talking about. She worked out of Bronte. This isn't her. I'm going to check this massage out as I don't mind a Hawaiian massage.

In my opinion I think this thread should be moved to the "Therapeutic Massage Parlours" section of the Forum.

Person's name: Jaye

Establishment: Living Room Yoga, Coogee; Aloha Wellness, Dee Why

Date of visit: December 2013

Contact details: 0402 687 959;  www.LomiLaka.COM  lomilaka@gmail.com; Jaye also sometimes advertises on gumtree.com

Hours of business: Wednesday 2pm-8:30pm, Thursday 2pm-8:30pm, Friday 9am-7:30pm. However these times are not concrete. If you phone Jaye and make alternate arrangements, and if it is possible on Jaye’s end, she will see you outside these times (as she did with me).

Rates: Costs vary depending on if there are specials on. I got a special of the one-and-a-half hour massage for $100 - however, the cost is usually $150 for that amount of time. It is best to contact Jaye to find out when/if there are specials on

Age: Late 20s or early 30s

Size/shape: 5'9", long, wavy brunette hair, size 8, C-cup breasts. Quite sexy in a "hippy" kind of way

Nationality: Australian Caucasian

Service provided: Lomi Lomi (i.e., Ka Huna) Massage. Yoga is also available

Value for money/recommended: I thought it was value for money and I recommend Jaye

My experience/comments: After seeing xkook1 start this thread, I tracked down Jaye's gumtree.com advertisement. From there I checked out her website and Facebook page - it all looked very professional. I phoned Jaye from a mates phone (displaying my mates number, he didn't care) asking about her service. I finished the conversation by asking would she mind if I have the massage done un-draped (i.e., without the sarong covering me). She was very adamant that this was not allowed and said she always covered her clients. I thought displaying my mates number (instead of calling from a private) may have leveraged the way to have the massage done un-draped. It didn't. No big deal. I phoned a few days later from my phone and made the booking with no problem. Jaye is very nice and professional.

I arrived at the premises at the agreed time. They had a shoe rack at the door so I took my thongs off and placed them on the rack. I wandered into the waiting room and there was a blonde and a brunette attending to something. I smiled and nodded at them, then walked back toward the door to see if there was a door bell or something. As I was walking back the brunette (i.e., Jaye) came out and called my name. I said that's me and she guided me into the massage room. Jaye was dressed in a black singlet top with a red sarong on, she may have been wearing thongs or barefooted, I can't remember.

The room was nice, spacious, and very clean. We chatted for about two or three minutes about why I wanted the massage, what the massage involved, etc. At the end of our conversation Jaye told me she would now leave the room and asked me to strip down naked, jump on the table, pull the sarong up over me, and yell out to her when I was ready.

This Lomi Lomi Massage is the real deal. There are no towels on the table because she massages above and below you. Those who have had a Lomi will know what I am talking about. It's a great massage to have.

Jaye comes back into the room and folds up the sarong so it is only covering my butt-crack and pulls my legs apart so my feet a hanging off the table. This is all quite sexy in a strange kind of way (i.e., the possibility you may get a flash in there). I didn't unfortunately. However the massage was top-notch. 10/10. Lots of long flowing strokes, as well as being somewhat firm and therapeutic at stages throughout the massage. Chilled music was playing and sometimes Jaye would break out in singing whatever tune was on which I didn’t mind. It all created a very chilled, relaxed atmosphere.

At about 50 minutes in Jaye asks me to flip over. She does the thing where she holds up the sarong so she doesn't get an eye full of my Johnson. Oh well. This lady is strictly professional. What she did next tells me there is absolutely no way anything funny will happen in this massage (and it's the first time it's happened in a Lomi Massage for me, and I have had many from a few different providers). Not only does she fold up the sarong so it's only covering your dick, but she also folds a heavy towel up into the sarong (it's hard to explain). She didn't do this when I was on my stomach. Anyways, what the heavy towel folded into the sarong does is make sure that even if you crack a fat, the towel and sarong will hold it down. A bit of a shame because I like cracking a fat in these massages. Even when she was moving my legs up to my stomach, stretching them, she made damn sure the sarong and towel didn't slip off. No dramas, you win some, you lose some. The massage continued, and it was fantastic.

The massage ended and I was offered a shower (so I assume you can shower beforehand if you want). I declined as I was going to go straight over to the beach for a swim. She left the room to allow me to get dressed. I was covered in the oil and could have easily rubbed one out (but decided not to). I got dressed, opened the door, and Jaye came back in. She gave me a hug and we said good bye. As I was leaving I grabbed my thongs off the rack, and noticed there were a hell of a lot more shoes on it then when I arrived. Maybe there was a yoga class on elsewhere in the building, but I didn’t hear anyone arrive during my massage (I couldn’t figure it out, maybe the music drowned out all those people arriving).

TL;DR - It was the best Lomi Lomi Massage I ever had, and I've had many. But there is absolutely no funny business here, not even opportunities for "accidental" flashes. I didn't ask for extras (only an idiot would think there was any on offer). But not for that reason. I just didn't want to come across as a sleaze-bag, as I'll be visiting her again, and there are plenty of other girls out there I can throw my balls around with - I want to keep this relationship respectful and professional. I highly recommend Jaye.

Personally, I had a great day. The massage was great, the weather was good, the beach was good, the perving on the beach was good, and I also popped over to the Coogee Bay Hotel for a few brews. Give it a go sometime fellas if you get the chance.

Thank you for your excellent review Cartman.

The web page in your review suggests this business is a solo operation (ad-hoc and touring) by Jaye.

Why do you think it belongs in the Therapeutic Massage Parlour section ?

Thank you Fartichoke and no problem. I just thought it belongs in the therapeutic section because nothing sexual occurred during the massage. But if the therapeutic section is strictly for parlours and not independents (like Jaye's business) I've got no problem with the review staying here. I'm easy either way.

Who reading this forum goes for a knowingly non hand relief massage, no one. Since when did this audience take higher ground and actually appreciate genuine massages. Lol how ridiculous. Move this to non happy ending forum and only post here if there is a chance of getting jacked off

Hi tersm2007,

Sorry for the delay in reply.

There is a shortage of Hawaiian/Kahuna/Lomi Lomi practitioners in Sydney at the moment unfortunately. However, the following ladies and advice may help you:

1. A woman named Mia gave me a great Hawaiian massage with happy ending about a year ago. Her number is 0425 353 232. Her Cracker ad is here: http://cracker.com.au/eastern-suburb...urn=1&pageno=1

2. A woman named Edie in the Manly area gave me a great Hawaiian massage with a happy ending a few years ago. She also does home visits throughout Sydney. However, I cannot guarantee she will give you a happy ending as she may have gone "straight" since I last saw her. Her number is 0437 302 331. Her Gumtree ad is here: Mobile massage | Massages | Gumtree Australia Manly Area - Manly | 1011312112

3. I visit sites such as Gumtree, here: http://www.gumtree.com.au/, Backpage, here: sydney classifieds for apts, jobs, and items for sale - backpage.com, Cracker, here: Cracker Classifieds - Cracker free ads & forums - find, sell or say anything!, and Bondi Classifieds, here: Sydney Classifieds | Classified Ads in Sydney Australia. When searching these sites I enter the search terms "Kahuna", "Lomi", and "Hawaiian" to see what therapists come up.

I hope this helps mate and fire off any questions you may still have.

p.s. Edie's phone manner can be quite abrupt and rude (I phoned her recently to get a quote). But don't let this turn you off as the massage is good.

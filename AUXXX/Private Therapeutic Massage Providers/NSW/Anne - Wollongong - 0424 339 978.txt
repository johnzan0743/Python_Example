After some time away from the punt I thought I would try something local in the gong. I was after a R&T and this one claimed to be a qualified masseuse. I found her the local paper, on the phone she seemed quite friendly, offered two options. A Massage CBJ and HJ and a FS option. claimed to be mid 40's. Made arrangements for the R&T service only for 1 hour $120. Was greeted by a mid 50's woman, she was pleasant enough and very friendly. The d√©cor was very was good and the place was very well set up and clean. I was not impressed with the massage at all and to much teeth on the CBJ so I lost the moment, just continued with the massage, I relaxed and tried to enjoy the time that was left. I was out of there in about 50 min. I will not be returning.

Hi tds,
I think I got caught with the same lady a few years ago.
Told me she was 39 on the phone and when i walked in I almost said I'm here to see your daughter.
Didn't walk but took the cheapest offer and couldn't wait to get out of there.
better luck next time

My experience/comments : Frankly I was surprised when the price was $40 to begin with, as most around the area are $35. Then the room wasn't that great. Coco's first day, which is never a good thing! The massage was super soft and lousy, there was no pillow on the turnover and I busted and she continued to jerk me off because she wasn't looking at me! The only good part was her conversation skills, and her body was pretty neat too.

But from this experience, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!

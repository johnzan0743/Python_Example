Hey duckman, I saw her back in September 2009, back then she was working at Dulwich Hill. She only did massage with a few extras; CBJ and spanish, I wasn't keen on any of them so I just went for the basic 30 minute RnT for about 100 bucks if I recall correctly. She was a BBW, I'd say about sizze 14-16, looked about mid-twenties, pretty face and had nice big cans, D-E cup size estimate. However the overall experience was pretty ordinary, mechanical almost and aside from a few bodyslides wasn't much else going on before she got stuck into the handjob. Maybe a case of YMMV, but she never really showed much interest in what she was doing. In the end she felt overpriced for what she was providing.

yeah same, this lady was not anything great and I won;t be back. Plus, she had cats everywhere when I saw her at dulwich hill and the towel she gave me had cat hair all over it. She is larger than her pictures...

I saw her around November last year, massage wasn't great and she was definitely a lot larger than in her photos. Would not recommend.

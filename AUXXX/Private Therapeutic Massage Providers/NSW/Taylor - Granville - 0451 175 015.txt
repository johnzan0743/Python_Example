Ok..I have yet to see this girl. Have spoken with her on the phone after seeing a vague review on another site.
Ok..spoke with Taylor today. Sounds as though she works from home as (believe it or not) she says she is married, but husband knows what she is doing and all is ok.
She works from a place in Granville. Is currently charging $120 and hour but seems to adjust depending on hour she feels.
She is hard to contact, and likely to call you back or text you at any time - so beware!
She offers straight sex, oral and massage - all covered but is negotiable on the covered oral depending on what is in front of her.
She does not sound like Miss personality on the phone... I have not seen her, just spoke to her on the phone.
As regards being shown on a forum or internet board, she didn't know what one was - but didn't care if she was on one (her words)
She also said she prefers a text message first.
Contact number 0451 175 015

If anyone gets there before me...please post...

Thank you for your "raw" note placebo.. it is unfortunate that you experienced this.. as has SS.. I am sure with this attitude she will not get many clients at that.. Consider it as taking one for the team.. TOFTT..

I will admitt if her attitude was better i would of stayed despite her looks, cute face but body well leave it at that lol, just from her attitude on the phone, then making me wait for a solid hour before deciding she needed money well thats the thing that pissed me off, how she berated me about her son, her normal life, ect ect not my fault or issue she has problems then like the rest of us dont bring them to work, she could of easliy stated I am having problems sorry to waste your time that would of been fine, dont leave me for a hour (I stayed lol for the hour on a humid muggy day dressed in jeans), then it flowed on down through the call then actually meeting her, I would of been a fool to stick around and get a very average service because of her attitude. Better luck if you want to try her, me can and will do with out.

Well I did actually see this girl before she shot of to Brisbane, she txt me (2 weeks ago) and for the bargain price of $150 for 2 hours figured well why not, chubby, not pretty but passable, shaved, nice tits, decent bbbj and sex in a variaty of possitions, I personally cum 4 times in the 2 hours, once over her tits while giving me my 1st bbbj, her titties got the biggest load of the day, she had a slight attitude when i 1st arrived BUT did warm up to the occasions due to my DATY which she did love heaps, and after each little session we chilled out on the bed or in the loungeroom and fucked her once on the lounge, look for $150 was a good 2+ hours, she needed the money real bad as 1st she offered $150 for the hour, when i said no a hour later she txt and offered me 90 min $150 i said make it 2 hours and the deal was done. I would not pay $150 for the hour for this girl but was better then i thought. 

She is in Brisbane now and said she may be back later on.

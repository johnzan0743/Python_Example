 Tamworth .. a few birds in the Bush
				
Post Content: 
Was in Tamworth on the weekend. In the past was pretty dry up there..

For those who don't know,  the economy is thriving in Tamworth, lots of jobs up there.. more migrants  moving there, as workers in demand.
 So,  a more diverse population these days and growing.
Along with that some services are in demand, and the oldest trade is among the mix.  Good sign for the future.


So a few more options.
Checked the local classifieds in the Northern Daily Leader.

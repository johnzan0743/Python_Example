My experience/comments:

My friends, and the rest of you, I'm a massage guy most of the time these days. Something about the oily majesty of the massage, those slippery strong feminine fingers fondling the family trust just gets me insanely aroused. Plus when the body to body rubbing starts happening, I swear I could start fires without matches it gets so heated. Warning! Combustible! No naked flame!

Anyways, I've seen the photos of Mystery (name to be revealed soon, this is just a holding place so I don't forget the details, as if!) over a year or so. She used to work in the East and I swore I'd go over and give her a slice of my lemon ... but I never got my ass in gear, so to speak. You know how it is. The East is the East. It's like another country. I swear they check your passport at South Dowling Street. It's like the North Shore. If it's so good in the North Shore, how come they charge you to leave? Answer me that one, you silvertails. If it's so good in the East, how come they won't build a railway there? Because they know everyone will leave! Ha ha. Only kidding.

Anyways, Mystery's now operating closer to my stomping ground, so I rang her up on the dog and bone, tossed her a line, put out my feelers, ran an idea up the flagpole, spread a concept out for the world to see, and she said "Yes". I was stoked. Times were agreed. I strode to the front of my motor car and spun the handle. She fired up on the tenth stroke, bless her. I was off.

Mystery is a very attractive young woman. You can tell just from the photos. Most women can look reasonable in pictures. If she's pretty, if she's slim and curvy, with good legs, she'll look fine. But some women exude sex. It comes off them like radioactivity. You know exactly what I mean. Marilyn Monroe. Pure sex. Everyone knows. There's no denying.

Mystery is like that. And in the flesh, she's like 3-D compared to 2-D. Did you see what I did there? I did, like, an obvious thing. Everyone is 3-D in life compared to in pictures. But I made it sound special. That's called writing and that's how you do it.

She's fabulous. Delicious. Unbelievable hot. Oh, she's not perfect. But Marilyn wasn't perfect either, far from it. Mystery is gorgeous. Her ass is full. Her legs are tapering. Her breasts are pert. Her hair is dirty blonde. Her face is pretty and her eyes, OMFG, her eyes are slutty. She half-closes them and the whites appear and she looks like she's off her head on something, and it's fabulous. Made me hard as.

So she works over my body on a proper massage table. Slaps the oil all over me. With each slap, I'm cheering. Love that slippy. Then she's riding me, grinding her pussy into my ass cheeks. I lift up in resistance. She mounts harder. I feel her lips on my butt crack. Oh fuck me Jesus. Take me to the place where we all die young, free and in love.

Then it's rollover Beethoven, time for the Fifth (limb). Her hands oil me up and work my balls and my stomach, and slap my cock against my tummy, and she pulls me back and spits in my one eye and I love it. Do it again, baby, I love that. She laughs, sneers, lets me see her slutty eyes, fuck me, those evil white eye slits, like she's high on something bad. Shit. I'm dying.

What happens next is At this point, I reserve the right to put this review on pause. I'll have to check what she does and does not want the world to know. Hence the name "Mystery". All will be revealed, friends and the rest of you snivelling dog-molesters. This is FM Radio, back after a short break, and now a message from our sponsors, don't touch that dial

Thank you for reading to the end at least! If it was me, I'd probably have stopped a lot earlier.

Not high. But I admit I was assaulted by a gang of Bitter Victorians. Vicious bastards, those Victorians, they don't let you away with anything. Then I went back to the post to ... ahem ... adjust it and tone it down. And - fuck - me the thing was locked.  I'll get round to crawling on my knees to the highers-up and they might let me take out some of the truly offensive stuff. All good.

I actually enjoyed the 'alternative' read. Always good to wade through some different literary styles. Of course, drugs - of varying kinds - always help the writer   

Waiting for "Mystery" 2b revealed...

Well I was loving it. Bit of an anti climax at the end though, just like some of my punts lol. 

There better be a phone number along with that name  ................

I cunningly anticipated this response and never actually got on my knees. Win! What? No win? Oh well. Nvm.

Yes, gents, details to follow. I'm teeing up another visit. And, no, I'm not a promoter but I will ask permission. Fine line? I dunno. More to cum.

So Freddy..... what ever happened to the end of this story. I've been waiting patiently for almost 2 months for this mystery ending.
Are you doing a George Lucas number here?

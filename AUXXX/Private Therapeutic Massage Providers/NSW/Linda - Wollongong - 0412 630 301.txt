 Linda - Wollongong - 0412 630 301
				
Post Content: 
Was in the area and in need of a massage as it has been a very long time.
Looked in the local paper and rang the above No
$70 half hour body to body massage with HJ
Close to centre of town
Apartment clean and good washing fascilities, towels could be a bit dryer.
Linda would be late 30's early 40's about size 10-12. A bit plane Jane but nice to talk too.
Massage was good not too hard and just what I needed. Maybe not as erotic as some would like
She got all the kinks out and asked me to turn over and got me hard enough to blow.
She does FS also but if I went back I would probably only go for a massage.
She has another girl there sharing another room with her.
All in all what I needed at the time but would look elsewhere. Other girls in the local paper all the same price.

Being a Wollongong local I have received a few massages from a girl by the name of Linda, and using the description as a guide I would say that we are talking of the same lady.

My experiences have totally varied with here between sensationally erotic and sensual in the earlier visits through to low level disappointment in latter visits which have included a 'souples' massage with my wife where she also felt the difference across her visits.

Early visits included some 'interesting ' work and use of her pubic hairs to tease, tantalise and eventually get a result as she manipulated Mr Happy with all her body parts. During these days/massages she was exemplary with her skills, touch and overall eroticism plus a pleasant conversation. However the later massages seemed to lose a lot of their eroticism and felt more 'tiresome' from her side, or at least that is how I felt it to be and as such they became disappointing.

As for her, she is as described a rather plain jane looking lady, but far from unattractive for a person who is in her 40's (she has told me and my wife her age) and in many ways this makes her more attractive as their is no 'fakeness'. Her conversations have always been pleasant but as with the massage that did drop in later visits and became to a degree quite uneasy to be around as she discussed her feelings for specific clients.

All up, after the later visits I was already seeing other ladies and have not really been back, but I am also aware that she became somewhat intimidated by what was thought to be a 'near caught' situation with council inspectors and she moved to another location.

Hi gazujc

If you get the time could you put up reviews of the other ladies you have seen?

Have thrown up a review of Analeise here :- http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/showth...t-0429-989-762

She does full service from memory but I have not partaken in that as I prefer RnT.

As for others, will do (for those I remember -   )

went to see linda today she is very friendly and she told me that she has had massage training which i could tell. Yes as other have said she is a bit of a plain Jane but defiantly not ugly or over weight. The massage was very good and there was plenty of sensual touching and caressing. She gave me a great back and front body slide and finished me up with a HJ with lots of me touching and fingering her. The whole thing was not rushed and friendly.

Id like to try some of the other girls in the Wollongong area first before returning but id defiantly like to go to Linda again.

Rumor has it that Linda has has to move as council closed her down. I have seen Linda and some of her girls many times over the years. When I find out where she is and who is still working with her I will write a few reviews

I know I said I'd write something soonish but I've been a tad busy. Linda and the girls had been working out of a house in Mt saint Thomas but that didn't work out for some reason and they're back in the flat in town. About a month ago I saw one of her girls, Kye and I'll write a review shortly.

My experience/comments:  Went there yesterday first time and was seen by the ml whom i don't think offered a name. Went into a massage room with rails on the ceiling which she later used when backwalking. Stripped off and she came back. She was dressed in knee length skirt and stretchy top like t shirt showing a little cleavage. Looked a bit like someones mother if you where chinese. She was a good talker except kept saying happy happy which got annoying. She is married two kids so she told me. Massage was strong and good on the back. covered with towel so i thought maybe nothing more. Backwalking fixed up some real knots. Too the legs the towel was removed from half my body and she worked from feet to bum cheeks. leg was pulled out wide and her hand got deep in my inner thigh just  accidentally  brushing the boy and his little nuts. Both legs the same the teasing was intense. Soft fingers followed full body but nothing to indicate RnT was on. Roll over and smaller towel placed over the now very happy boy. She told me i was naughty but i said her fault. This lady is very bubbly and i was enjoying her teasing. Front chest and stomach very low on pubis hand sliding under the manhood. up the legs and again deep into the groin i was to say the least very horny. The towel was slipping off and she again worked around to my lower stomach. I managed to get the towel of the boy and she with a surprised look said "Your boy is very Hard" very healthy. She then ran a finger nail along his length and said that she could help him but she didnt normally do this. Yeah pull the other one. She said you have to pay more i said ok $20 to which she then gave an excellent tugg with ball and arse play until i launched a load. I asked if she would show me her tits but she said no just this. All in all the best teasing massage i have ever had.

Guys,

I have been there a couple of times. Very good massage, very personal and bubbly. There was plenty of teasing but again no hj on offer.

Maybe she doesn't do it anymore?? I did ask a few times and she said not my job to me as well.

Hi Guys,
It's bee a while since i visited blue Moon but i went again Friday 10th June. She remembered me and gave me a wonderful and very good massage with the usual  teasing and tackle tickle that i remember. I asked for a hand job and she told me i was a naughty boy and then proceeded to wank me with one hand while playing with my arse with the other. $20 extra for the tug. I always get an hour and i did go at least 3 times or 4 before the first tug. Maybe she only does it for customers that she did before. ymmv

iv known this ML for 15yrs. yes she had trouble with the council in the early days so she is very careful and now has a well established massage business that she wont risk , so thats why you wont get to far with tugs till she knows you well enough.

I went to visit this lady a few weeks back, not having read all these reviews first, but thought I’d check it out as it is fairly local (and a new place to me).

Things appeared quite promising at first – Lisa answered wearing a white skirt and top, was very chatty and quite flirty. She started off by covering me with towels and doing the back-walking thing.  Then she sat on my backside as she massaged me and continued the flirting... the signs were good. That seemed to be confirmed when she spent a lot of time massaging my butt and upper thighs.

However, when I turned over, she held the towel in place and continued to massage my chest only. Although at one point she did hop up on the table and use the hand rails again to massage my groin with her feet just either side of my tackle.  That was quite sensual, especially as it gave me a good view up her skirt ;-P  – but alas nothing else was forthcoming.

Overall I thought the massage was a bit disjointed and not on a par with a couple of the other local establishments.  In fact, at times she stopped massaging as she chatted away - a bit too talkative for my liking

Like grannykiller said, I think she would need to see you a couple of times before she would be willing to tug.  Personally I’m not sure if I will try again, given other options in the area.

yeah she flirts and teases too much. she used to hump my arse during the back massage.. one day i asked how much for full service, $70 and off came her gear. but she was not passionate. it was just all business. friendly enough but keeps a cold distance. could be she  loves her husband and just does extras for $$$, this was all a long time ago but i reckon she would still do more after she knows you well. i was seeing her for years for the tug. she does enjoy playing with cock .

pity she won't play with mine! Been 4 times now and the best I can get is to crank myself off while she watches and laughs, did get to fell her tits the last time though so she is freeing up a little.

This Milf/ Gilf TCM L was visited by fcuking JW's and ever since stopped doing the tug. Except if you challenge her regarding the veracity of the crap the JW's tell her. None of which can be found in any standard Bible text.
Now this girls got the religion bug. She still needs to pay the mortgage and so occasionally will do the tug and the tits out tug at that. She has a great pair.
Now whilst I respect her right to believe whatever she wants to believe I pointed out to her that if she could find whatever theme the JW's were on about then I would pay her for the massage and return every day for a month and have a massage without a tug but if she couldn't find or backup what was told to her within a fortnight (I am nothing if not fair) from the Bible then I would return and she would offer me the same service I had received from before from her with an added bonus that I won't disclose here. Now she accepted the challenge and as you guessed I returned a fortnight later and got my bonus and delightful it was indeed.
In fact she enjoyed Mr Biggus and myself so much I thought she might convert to Agnosticism once more or at least give Buddha another look. But those JW's had her by the panties. So to speak.
NVM I think she still may be a cause worthwhile resurrecting but would require many of us planting the seed that the tug and or fs may be her only real salvation.

Lord forgive me for all the puns used in this thread.



Biggus.

Yep, strange one this one for me. Does a fantastic massage, but I went again the other day to her new massage flat at the back after about a year and same experience as before. Nice massage, plenty of accidental touching but no HJ. Had to self service while I fondled her arse.

Wierd,  but surprisingly good

I finally caught up with this lady last friday. I was after a decent massage and remembered the reviews. Made the appointment. Met at the door by a very friendly lady. I paid the money and stripped naked. She came back and asked what I wanted. I said neck and shoulders only. She does an acceptable massage and she concentrated on the neck and shoulders but did go down the back and arms and also feet. Overall a very good massage. Rolled over and I had half a mongrel.

I think this lady does love cock and I asked for a HJ but she said "not my job you do it". Felt rather strange her still massaging my legs and me wanking all the while she was staring at my cock. I am sure she loves doing what she does.

Anyway nice massage and interesting tug all for $35 so good value. I will go back and try and get her to tug me

Decided to give BM another go as it’s pretty close to me, I fancied a decent massage and a change from the usual places in the area.  

The massage “clinic” is around the back of the house.  On the plus side, the massage was good and she also went well over the half hour I’d booked ($35).  On the negative side she does talk a lot, which means she does get a bit distracted from the massage at times.  She’s not easy to understand either and she kept asking – “what do you think?”  every so often.  What I really thought was “just STFU and get on with the massage”, but I kept that to myself.  She also told me she was doing bible studies in the evenings – I think another poster had mentioned the JWs have been messing with her mind.  She even gave me a leaflet!

All that said, she’s a nice lady overall.  Based on all the reviews I wasn’t expecting to be offered a HJ and I didn’t bother asking, as I’d only come to try the massage.  Funny thing though, when I was face up she kept me covered with a towel but was massaging her fingers into my groin and under my balls until I had a good sized twitching tent pole going.  That didn’t phase her at all and she just kept on doing it and ‘accidently’ brushing against the pole!

Would I go back?  Maybe, she’s very cheerful and the massage was good.

I saw this lady for the first time way back in the 90s.  The first time I called her I asked if she did a full-body massage, and she just laughed and said no.  Since then I visited her about 4 or 5 times over a number of years, always for the $50 45 minute massage, and at no time was a handjob on offer, although I never specifically asked.  She did however agree to massage me completely nude without draping.

I remember that on one occasion I did see outside the massage room a basket full of soggy tissues, so I was left wondering.  Based on what has been said in these revues I presume it was the residue from all the guys who DIY'd.

Another thing that I remember is that right from my very first visit she chatted about religious topics in a rather childish way, eg how Jesus loves me etc, so obviously she was into religion back in the 90s, it is not a recent development.  I thought of suggesting that perhaps God would want her to see my spunk spurt, but discretion was the better part of valour.

I cannot remember when I saw her last, but it was before 2010.  It may well be that after that date she began offering more, as described by the first review on this thread, but if so it is apparent that she quickly reverted to being legit, as described in the subsequent reviews.

There is one thing that has changed in her operation.  All the times I visited her, from the 90s until the early 2000s, it was possible to just turn up at her door and get a massage almost straight away.  Now apparently it is necessary to book ahead, and from reviews that I have read recently in media such as "True Local" she is often fully booked.  That could mean that she is now offering more, but not necessarily so.

When I wrote the initial review she definitely offered more. It was my second visit she gave me a hj and every visit for the next two years. After a break of a couple of years I went back and the religious guilt had set in and the previous offered services were no longer available. I do take offence at Paunchy accusing now a number of forum members liars especially from a guy who has not offered a review on a new ml.

I am pretty angry about this that some guy can come here and every week he has a go at other members. I know he has questioned Cartman's integrity as well. Maybe the moderators should have words with this guy who seems to write far more than he punts. Having some respect for the other forum members should be a priority. Everyone's milage varies with punts I myself have been offered less than others on occasions but that doesn't lead me to making a post questioning their reviews. You are not making a valued contribution to the forum Paunchy by doing this so go punt find a ml and review her on your experience not judge others who may just be luckier, nicer or better than you at asking.

This lady was religious when I first saw her way back in the 1990s, so her religiosity is not a recent development.  So far as I can remember, my last visit took place at least a couple of years before your visit described in your review of 3 June 2011, so it is possible that in the interim her "religious guilt" had faded to the extent that became willing to offer handjobs for payment, but if that was the case, it seems to have returned very quickly, as shown by the majority of the subsequent reviews.

Sparksy               3 June 2011 (same date as yours):        No HJ
Eaglebarret          3 June 2011:                                        No HJ

m39au                22 June 2011:                                      No HJ

Sparksy               6 November 2013:                                Return visit after about one year, still no HJ
The wizard777    13 December 2013:                               No HJ
Sparksy               7 February 2017:                                 Confirmed that he had never received an HJ over a period of some 6 years.

The covergence of evidence seems to be that this lady will refuse to give an HJ, although she will allow clients to DIY.

Now I know that a massage lady who has regularly given an HJ to her clients may abruptly stop doing so, for one reason or another (one common reason being that some clients have started to hassle her to give more than she is prepared to, or have become rude and aggressive).  I have had that experience myself, of a massage lady whom I had seen a number of times suddenly saying that she no longer offered an HE.

I also know that many massage ladies who offer a service that is basically legitimate will only offer an HJ after she has seen a particular client a number of times and come to trust him.  Again I have had that experience, for example with Charlotte at Westmead, whom I have reviewed.

In the case of Lisa, the very first time I contacted her back in the 1990s she denied that her massage was "full body", a term which back then was generally understood as a code for massage with hand relief.  It is obvious that that was the sense in which she understood the term, so she was effectively denying that she would do an HJ.  Now it is quite common for massage ladies who do do hand relief not to admit to it over the phone, but they generally will confirm that their massage is "full body".

Furthermore, in the 4 or 5 massages I received from this lady, she never did anything to indicate that a HE would be on offer.  Her massage room (which at that time was a large room at the front of her house) was set up like a legitimate massage place, with a table covered with leaflets and books about health matters.  Added to that was her openly expressed religiosity, which was t5here the first time I saw her.

So for all those reasons I never asked her for an HJ in all the times I visited her, from the late 1990s to the early 2000s.  Based on most of the reviews of her in this thread, I think it likely that I would have got the same answer as most of the reviewers: "Not my job".

If Tugalong would read all my posts, he would see that that since joining on 5 January this year, I have posted two complying reviews, and quite a lot of information about massage ladies whom I have seen in the past and who are still operating.  A reasonable contribution I would think.

Oh FFS paunchy... this over-analysis of one ML and constant dredging up of other old threads is becoming very tiresome. Frankly, we don't give a shit what you did umpteen years ago and whether or not a past provider is a god-botherer or not. Get over it and move on.

Your time here may be limited if you continue to post meaningless chat rather than informative reviews. You certainly won't generate any friends or progress up the forum through achievement.

Hi Paunchy

I joined up around the same time as you. As did Probe. In the same time you claim you had a reasonable contribution of three reviews, I have posted over 150 and Probe has posted over 170.

It is this continual chatter and nonsensical contributions that clutter our review pages. I often check out a new post only to find it is chit chat and is preceded by more chit chat.

Years ago Lisa would do HJ if requested. I remember asking with pleading eyes and erection, she laughed and said ok. But that was many years ago in the front room of the house. Now days, will do a sensual massage if requested, soft, slight brushing. Last time I saw her I said how much I liked her massage, understood about HJ and would go up the road to have that done. She fully understood and the massage was indead quite erotic....quite a turn on.....but no HJ. Which was ok.

I saw her once in the mid 2000's and received a HJ.  Didn't bother her at all.  I noticed a strategically placed mirror in her front room and was confident it would be on offer.  That said, never went back lol..

Saw Mercedes a couple of months ago, she operates out of a house in Penshurst, contact was straightforward with quick reply.
Mercedes has two types of services, one straight and one erotic, so you have to specify which one you want.
On arrival was greeted by Mercedes who took me into the massage room, nicely fitted out, very clean neat house, Mercedes tells me to take off my clothes and leaves the room, shortly after she returns and says that she wants to give me an examination down below, she tells me to stand near the window where there's more light and she's giving me a thorough examination and she has a glove on one hand, go figure.
After getting the all clear I jump up on the table , she takes her clothes off and she's giving me a good massage, tells me to turn over , same again, nice massage, encourages to play and suck her tits, she then gives me a BBBJ, she then asks if I would like penetration, I said "it depends, is it with or without a condom?" she said, "up to you", I said " no, not this time", the truth was that we didn't really click and I wasn't in the mood for it, she then finished me off by hand, perhaps she may get better with more visits, however YMMV.

It's not permanently closed. She just stops advertising/working occasionally. I called her beginning of the week and she is still working.

Not sure what you are googling but it showed as open during her business hours. She even has reviews from 5 days ago and she replied to a review 2 weeks ago.

Looks she she has an updated website for 2020 as well and you can book in for tomorrow.

My suggestion as always with women like these who may have two sides to their services, is to message first rather than call.

Yes, Mercedes can be quite prickly via phone and SMS.

My suggestion with massage ladies who provide both legit and erotic services (but who don't advertise the erotic service) is to ask them 'delicate' questions such as: "Do you mind if I have the massage done undraped?", etc, and take things slowly.

The parable of the old bull and the young bull explains this better than I ever could.

Person's Name : Mercedes

Establishment : Private house in Penshurst 

Date of Visit : Feb 20

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : https://www.mercedesremedialmassage.com.au/

Phone : 0429 778 971

Hours of Business : Until 7pm

Rates : $149/hr (Hawaiian massage option), $59/hr (Swedish Relaxation)

Age : 40-50

Size/shape : Brunette, short and stumpy, looks like she had big tiddies covered up

Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie European

Services Provided : Hawaiian massage, draped with a cloth.

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : 

Thanks to trapper's review along with the helpful comrades above, my curiosity for extra services led me down an expensive journey.

Upon entry, Mercedes was quite stand-offish, however not rude. She requested me to sign a waiver saying that I wasn't in contact with anyone with the Corona virus, plus a few medical forms (similar to what you would fill out at the doctors).

I payed via her website through paypal while making the booking online and asked about having the massage undraped. Mercedes informed me that this was not possible with the Swedish Relaxation massage, and was only possible to be undraped with the Hawaiian option.

So I bit the bullet and decides to have a gamble and upgraded to the Hawaiian style which was $90 on top.

Long story short, this gamble did not pay off, nor did I even get the usual thrill which comes with a gamble.

Massage was promised to have massaging strokes to the under-body, and was not even attempted. All in all, it was a very mediocre massage to which when I looked at the clock was finished after about 45min worth of massaging, with about 10min spent with the greeting chit chat and the filling out of forms. You would think that after charging over $2.50/min I would at least get the 60min of massaging.

Throughout the visit Mercedes was kept bringing up that she was only following the 'guidelines' and 'codes of practice' of her massage qualifications, basically trying to indirectly suggest extras were definitely not on the menu.

$150 is definitely spent better elsewhere, it was quite the disappointing experience, without even getting anywhere close to the jewels or any sensuality whatsoever.

For the comrades have built up rapport and/or received extras from this lady, any advice on how to pursue to acquire the desired extras? (drop me a dm if that is preferred please)

Yes, this one is strange, I just remembered, she said that if I wanted the erotic massage again, she wanted me to message using the name "Sandi".

Perhaps you should have taken note of the experience described by stallion 1973, who made a phone enquiry about the "erotic massage" and was severely reprimanded by the lady for his impertinence. Furthermore, her website does not suggest anything other than a totally legitimate service.

It may be that this person once did erotic massage but has now decided to provide a totally legitimate service only.  That would not be unusual; I have in the past encountered masseuses who used to provide an erotic service but then suddenly discontinued it, eg Suzie Heath in the ACT. If that is the case, it would seem that she has become addicted to the ability to charge $150 per hour, and now tries to rake in the same amount by offering Kahuna massage (which is still overpriced, given that Bondi Kahuna charges $130 for a 60-minute totally legitimate massage).

By the way, this is the entry on Yelp for Mercedes Remedial Massage, which states that it was permanently closed.  The description of it does not suggest anything other than a legitimate therapeutic service.

Further to my previous post, here is a link to the counselling and hypnotherapy service provided by Mercedes:

https://www.anchoredwithin.com.au/

Again this does not suggest a person who provides any sort of erotic service.

And here is her listing in Natural Therapy Pages:

https://www.naturaltherapypages.com....nselling/42856

Draw your own conclusions.

Finally, here is a link to another business, called "Catalina Hot Stones", that appears to be run by Mercedes. The phone number is different, but the address is the same.

Person's Name : mercedes

Establishment : peakhurst

Date of Visit : 6:3:20

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Phone :tel:0429778971

Hours of Business : 

Rates : $140 ??

Age : 50 ??

Size/shape : stocky short

Nationality or Ethnicity : south american

Services Provided : remedial massage

Value for money/recommend? : no

My experience/comments : i rang Mercedes and she insisted i book and pay online. First warning sigs
Okay im on the punt . Here goes.   I book a swedish 1.5 hour massage ( cant remember exact cost) not cheap.

I get there for a relaxing madsage , greeted and bought in to fill out a form like im at a physio . Injuries medical history etc.  i remind her that im here for relaxation, she insists i fill it out.  I had pulled my back the week prior which she caught onto when i walked into the room.

Told me to keep undies on , the next hour and twenty i was pushed and prodded by someone who had done a massage course but is as tactile as a brick. Mercedes has no warm touch and goes through mechanical text book movements with no sense of touch.  The whole time lecturing me on what to do going forward. She was forceful with her hands and not caring at all .  I reminded her of the fact it should be Swedish but she was hell bent on trying to fix me .  One of the worst massages ive had in thirty years stay clear.   I put my wallet with a very visible large amount of cash down. This was ignored .  Mercedes wants nothing to do with anything sexual ..   WORST PUNT EVER

Mikey, thanks for the review mate. I completely understand as per my review, I had a very similar experience. Lucky you got away with the 'swedish relaxation' version of her money grab which was less than the $150 I paid.

Clearly from previous reviews she caters for other clients who she has built up rapport with. But with service provided as the above, I think she is crazy if people think there is an investment beyond the initial sour taste that is left with the first visit.

Zero customer service, communicated to in a condescending manner, and ended like a financial transaction.

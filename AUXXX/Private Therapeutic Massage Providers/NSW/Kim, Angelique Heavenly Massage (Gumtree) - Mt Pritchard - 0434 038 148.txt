I have seen her just recently. It was ok, but not fantastic. Her ad is on Gumtree and Craigslist as "Angelique Heavenly Massage".

I'll try and do a review ASAP, but in a nutshell, I won't be returning...and although it IS her picture in the ads, it makes her look a lot younger than she is, and the remedial side of the massage isn't anything to write home about.

 Kim, Angelique Heavenly Massage (Gumtree) - Mt Pritchard - 0434 038 148
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Kim

 Establishment : Private

 Date of Visit : Early December. Weekday around 12pm

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Angelique Heavenly Massage - Mt Pritchard 0434 038 148
Angelique Heavenly Massage | Massages | Gumtree Australia Liverpool Area - Liverpool | 1034322306

 Hours of Business : 8am - 9pm

 Rates : To be honest I forget the exact amount. But it was par for the course, around $100 /hr with HJ

 Age : Would guess around late 30's early 40's

 Size/shape : Size 10 slim. Didn't see beneath the clothes.

 Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie

 Services Provided : Massage and HJ, nude if requested.

 Value for money/recommend? : Was ok, not a bad experience, but nothing to write home about.


I SMS'd this massage lady after reading her ad on Gumtree (But I think I have seen her on Locanto too). Despite the regular "No Sexual services" disclaimer, there is certainly a happy ending on offer.

Contact was easy via SMS, she was initially booked out, but SMS'd me back the next day to say she had a vacancy. Be aware of this if you don't like surprise messages.

I was given an address and arrived at a private house in Mt Pritchard. Older style house, but tidy. Her B/F or husband was sitting on the front porch on the laptop, but he said hi and bye and was friendly enough.

Into the bedroom and onto a massage table in front of the wardrobe mirror for the massage, which was ok but nothing particularly exceptional. Enough tackle tickle to keep me interested during the 1st half, and then a little thigh work before the finale. She used LOTS of oil, and when I had finished, the front of her dress was absolutely soaked in the oil from her leaning over me at times.

This was all done with me nude, and undraped. She initially said she usually does (her) naked, but it was her time of the month so her clothes were on. I am not sure I would have asked anyway.

The HJ at the end was competent, without being memorable.

There was a shower (ensuite) offered before and after the massage. You will certainly need it afterwards due to the amount of oil dripping off you.

Just a warning, IF you see any of her ads with a photo of a reasonably attractive Blonde....be aware that it IS her, however the photo is a glamour type shot with LOTS of makeup. In person, she looks a lot older, and not what I would describe as overly attractive. The photo almost looked like a mid-20's girl. 

She was however, quite friendly and genuine.

Overall, it was a reasonable punt. I would not say it was money wasted, but I won't be back as it was nothing special.

Cheers, Shane

I tried this lady a month or so ago. I arrived about 15 mins early so was waiting in the car. 

She has back to back clients so I saw the last client leave the house about 2 mins before my appointment (awkward eye contact between us lol). The house also is not very discreet, its a very open corner house with a long open footpath to the front door, so if you like to be discreet this one is not for you.

I called about 1 minute before just incase she was not ready and still wiping the previous clients saliva off her boobs. she asked me to wait 10mins and call back. Called back, she said that something had come up and she couldn't see me. It actually worked out okay and I left, as I wasn't very keen on all the neighbours seeing me walking up her footpath (call me paranoid lol). So that's my story...

Seeking, You certainly didn't miss out on anything overly memorable, so money well saved by you!

The description of the location is spot on, corner house which is also elevated, so standing on the doorstep you can definitely be seen by everyone. 

It sounds like you may have seen her around the time she started advertising, hence lots of customers. Based on the picture in the ads sometimes, she will certainly get a lot of one-time customers, but I don't think there will be may return visitors.

 Qualified Massuse Liverpool
				
Post Content: 
Add in local paper reads: An Australian Lady qualified Full Body Massage. Liverpool. Priv. No Sex 0434 038 148.

Saw this lady last week. Over the phone I asked about RnT and she said she does not discuss over phone and went on about a bad experience. Anyway decided to give her a try. She works from her house at Mt Pritchard. 

Made the appt and ventured over. Knocked on the door and was greeted by her teenage daughter....not a good start. The lady comes down and then said didn't you get my text, I said to wait 5 min. Anyway into the room and she says $70 for 1 hour massage or $100 with happy ending. Went for the $100. She is not unattractive and appeared to have a good body which unfortunately I did not get to see. I guess she would be late 40's. 

The massage was....disappointing. She claims to be qualified but I found it very ordinary. No pressure. Anyway flip over and she massages the front as well and then starts the tug. I asked about nude and she said NO. The tug was ok and she got me over line.

Will I go back...........NO. Ordinary massage and no nude not worth the money in my opinion.

Called in the other week. Easy enough to make a booking. Quoted $90 for the hour. Was greeted at the door by Kim, would say mid to late 40's blonde, size 12 at a guess. Showered and on the table face down for the massage to begin. Fairly talkative, but easy going, think she was trying to suss me out, without giving too much away.  A good massage overall, no tackle tickle, but effective. Rolled over for the front, no towel, and again a pretty good massage. Slowly made it to the end, she whispered I guess we are done here, made the enquiry an extra $30 for the tug...... Asked about nude, said she didn't really like doing nude on first visit, but did do fairly good tug, massage the balls withe her nails etc...... Very nice.  Got a good feel of the body, felt nice and will be back to do the nude massage soon.

Overall $120 for the hour, a bit pricey for non nude massage, but did 't feel ripped off, and will be back.

Happy Pills.

Tried to call and book her... she said that she doesn't any male massages anymore, too hard to find security and her partner told her to stop... she only works with females, claiming that she always was and is professional massage only... LOL sure.

We can delete this one fellas.

I saw her ad the other day, and she REALLY pushes the non-sexual side of things. So I'm not surprised at this. 

And to be honest....you're not missing much really. As for "Always was professional massage" I've got the memory of an ordinary massage and more ordinary handy that suggests otherwise!

She's a different kinda of experience, don't expect a run and gun affair. If you want to take it slow and just let your mind at ease this is a good option, albeit pricey!

For the mug punter like Kerouac $250/60 for a bit of heavy breathing, creative visualization and and puritanical 'dirty talk' is more than overpriced.

For those not in the know tantra = no sex!

What about for us rub and tug fans? How do these 'tantric' massages stack up? She offers lots of different packages starting at $150 per hour but there is no mention of any actual 'service' if you know what I mean...

Having been with her, she does the "service". 

Very open minded and a nice girl. If you like them super slim and rock hard then she's for you. If you like big breasts and curves then may not be your cup of tea.

Not a regular rub and tug and she offers the whole tantra spiritual/relaxation thing, but it does get sexual.

I have visited Bella on 3 occasions and found her to be extremely unusual with her service being very varied depending on her mood.  She likes to call the shots and you dont get much say in it..I have had FS and BBBJ with her and then other times she decides that massage is all she wants to do.

Overall not a bad fuck but she is to hit and miss for my liking and also she is not cheap  there are much better options for your money

My second prostate massage with this chick...Better then the first.
When I blew, I just blew and blew and blew again.
She milks every last drop out of you.
10/10 this time.

I'm going to build myself up without any orgasm for a couple of weeks and go back to see her.

IT IS WORTH THE EXTRA!

Luna just does a great massage with hand job if you ask. [which you have no choice in doing by the time she finishes the massage]Nothing else
Bella does all.
It depends on my moods. Sometimes I just want a good sensious massage with hand job...other times I want them to suck me and then for me to fuck their brains out! Bella fills the second although I have just had the prostate massage for 1 hour.

Hmm, money is a bit of an issue, and I'm more of a RnT guy than FS. 
The prostate massage sounds interesting especially as u said u were completely emptied so it must have been pretty good but at 3x the price!

I just have to work out if the prostate massage part is worth the extra $$$ for the experience or intensity!

You should only need to wait about 3 days for a good build up, any longer and production slows down.  Best way is to hit it really hard for a few days to get the body producing on overtime, then stop for 3 days. Your body is still on overdrive and it's all build up from there. 

Waiting for too long the gland doesn't need to produc and the muscles begin to lose tone!

I have only ever had a couple of prostrate massages as they have a habit of completely draining you dry!
And they were a while back.
But recently a mate told me that you really need to be careful as to who you let do it.
Something about busting a membrane around the proximity and causing infections and/or even cancer.
Anyone with any reliable medical expertise on that story?

Yep, true that. We really need women who know what they're doing in that area. Can go wrong very easily. Vigorous prostate massage is very dangerous. Prostate massage - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

 However, plenty of toys on the market giving hands free dry orgasms - Prostate Massage, Sex Toys for Men, Male G-Spot, Prostate Stimulators Stimulation, Anal Toys Great toy. Depends on the individual on results. Some may need re-wiring. But a healthy and a medically proven prostate massage device. Only one one the market with actual medical credentials. Well worth it.

Thanks for that Raw...The prostate massage is very intense feeling and orgasm, but I won't be having anymore.

If I can recommend some good h/j's though it would be Amy at 115 Oxford street Bondi [93896618] Alex ay Ormonde parade Hurstville and Wendy at O'Riorden street Mascot.
As I have mentioned before there appears not too many good private massage ladies around at present....
I'm waiting on a report about Linda at Plumpton but no one is taking the punt!
She really sound sexy over the phone, so again, anyone going to take the punt with this one?

Just a note of warning!
My mate who does not contribute here saw her about a week ago...He loves the prostate massage!
He now has some bleeding and is waiting for a diagnosis after a trip to the hospital.
Someone did mention earlier it can be dangerous...Incredible feeling if you get someone that has some experience and cares for the client.
This bitch at times does not give a fuck for your welfare!

He should be worried more about prostate cancer IMHO. I assume they are also doing a PSA as well as test  for infections.

FYI Doing a PSA is not the same as a physical exam. PSA is only a really good test to perform as a monitoring test for treatment of PC. There are many ways PC can be detected but a physical examination by your own GP who has your Medical History is the first way and then if any doubt off to the Hospital or Urology Specialist for further investigation. Ultrasound or CT Scan is the next step but guys should not worry about PC as many males over 60 live with it and have long and productive lives. There are many forms and stages and severity of this type of Cancer but early detection is the key. I would not be concerned about prostate cancer with the aftermath of a poorly executed anal probing by a WL or ML but of more concern is the tearing of the membrane and associated tissues surrounding the anus. True infection by faecal material is common with anal tears and fissures. The chances of getting PC by anal probing are virtually non existent however cancer of the rectum and lower bowel cancer may be the thing of concern with anal bleeding. If in any doubt one should not rely on Wikipaedia for information but rather visit the GP or Hospital for further examination/investigation.

SX,

Again we see another "informed" post by yours truly.. Although welcomed and insightful.. We ask you to refrain from "examining" the situation and medical practise.. This should be left to the "professionals" which I know doubt the greater membership is aware of.. 

Those that are unsure please seek your local health practitioner and get sound advice and check up.. 

To the other contributors.. Assumptions and hearsay do not replace actual experience spent.. We understand the concerns.. Just dont take it off topic and negativity.. As unless we are there we don't know what occurred, only ones point if view and experience..

AB

Person's Name : Bella Tantra

Establishment : Private, North Sydney

Date of Visit : March 2013 

Hours of Business : 10am to 10pm

Rates : $200 per hour

Age : Late 30s

Size/shape : Slim and muscular, 6, A cup 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian

Services Provided : Tantric Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? Diff'rent strokes

My experience/comments : 

I've been to see Alannah in St Leonard's a few times and she calls her service tantric, and her massage is incredibly erotic, so I thought I would try Bella as their prices are the same...

Bella is as described above and her pictures on Cracker are quite accurate. She is super thin and quite tall, but not what I would call classically beautiful. She also has has a vapid quality which I found a little irritating. But if you like that Byron bay hippy shit she might float your boat. 

There was a whole lot of breathing exercises which i was happy to explore. It basically involved Bella performing some tackle tickle while I breathed deeply; not altogether a terrible experience. Though she was 'coaching' throughout and I would have preferred her to keep quiet and let me do my own thing. But I can hardly hold that against her seeing as its what I'm actually paying her for....

After I turned over it was more of the same. She several times brought me to the brink and then eased off whilst I continued the breathing thing. This culminated in a pretty epic orgasm, unlike anything I've really experienced before. Whilst it was good, I don't think I have the discipline to push on with the tantric thing, I much prefer the bodyslide eroticism of Alannah or places like Bodyrotic. 

Overall it was good for a once off, but it wasn't a particularly erotic experience so I won't be returning.

Yes, I've seen Bella a few times lately. Highly recommended. 1.5hrs would be best. A very sensuous, intelligent and sensitive woman. The front body slide she does while holding your cock is pretty amazing. It will certainly take your mind off things!

Hello Dave
Welcome to AUXXXReviews. As a Paid Member you are no obligation to post a review, but perhaps you could review Bella for us as you have seen her recently. We have no reviews of her for over 3 years so an update would be good. Below are instructions on how to access our Review Template.

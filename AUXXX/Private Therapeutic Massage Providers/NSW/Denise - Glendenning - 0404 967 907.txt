My experience/comments : 
I have seen Denise for a number of years now. She is only working seeing regulars but I am fairly sure she wouldn't mind seeing a few new clients.

She has had some surgery and is only working part time atm. Denise does a relaxation style massage. She has a garage in her townhouse at the front converted into a massage room. Being in Sydney's west it can be a little cold of an evening and also way too hot during summer so pick your times as she only uses a fan during summer and a fan heater during winter.

The massage starts with you face down. Now Denise applies a good pressure and works the upper back and lower back quite thoroughly she then does some work on your legs and unusually requests you to turn over sooner than most. She does however do a thorough massage on your front. She does an excellent massage on both arms and does some work on your inguinals.

She does often brush your cock and ballsack and this will probably get you aroused as the incidental touching appears not to be deliberate, however she manages to brush the equipment incidentally numerous times.

She then gives a good facial massage.

You will probably need to request the tug as she does not think about doing it every time. She does a reasonable two handed tug. You usually can access her huge tits which are obviously hidden away under a shirt and tucked into a bra. Not for those who don't enjoy a larger breasts. Her nipples are quite sensitive and she is okay with them being played with but not mauled. Licking and sucking is allowed but possibly not on the first visit.

Denise has an unfortunate face. She looks a little like she has just sucked a sour lemon. She does a competent massage and a reasonable handjob.

Denise does not currently advertise so if you contact her you should say you saw her ad in the Advocate a while back and you saved it into your phone do not disclose this forum to her.

Guys, if it helps..... Denise also advertises on a legitimate massage site.

Her ad is still active there. It also begs the question.....how many more entries there may be providing extras.

I am happy to post the link, but it may not be the best idea?? Mods to advise. Otherwise I am happy to answer via PM

Shane.

Thanks for pointing that out Shane. Without going into too much further detail and as I am fairly certain there are many PML's who possibly advertise on there and can be found in various Industry Websites such as AMT ATMS and MAA ARM and Natural Therapy Pages to name but a few.

Thing is she along with many other practitioners offer other services apart from the usual ones to some but not all clients.

Discretion is the key to accessing those services. Being polite and not too intrusive is the way to give the therapist confidence in you as a client.

That being said Denise advertises in the local Cumberland (News Ltd) Newspapers so if you wish to sample you contact her on the number given and if she asks how you got the number just say from an ad in the local paper you had a bad leg or back at the time and you looked in the paper and took down a few numbers. You didn't ring her as you saw another therapist but that one has now moved. So you thought of her and remembered you put her number into your phone. Just remember to put her number in your phone! 
Simple really. If only it were! 

Now Shane as you can see included in the reply just above by myself is the Association or website she has advertised in. Actually the source is a really good one for finding potential punts. Just be aware not to approach some of these legit really legit therapists with overt questions.
Some not all get offended really easily!

Yep, couldn't agree more Biggus. As for that website above....I've tried a few times with a few from that site and had no luck as yet.

That being said; I do generally look for those in my area of work & home.....which being in the Hawkesbury, makes the pickin's slim!

I've just found a new one though, and will report back.

Shane.

MASSAGE . Treat yourself to a delightful massage by Lynette. Relax. Renew! 4751 7289



Hours of Business : By appointment

Rates : $80 per hour

Age : Late 40's

Size/shape : Very slim Decent "B" Cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : United Kingdom Caucasian.

Services Provided : FBM and HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes Not bad

My experience/comments : Looking at the Site realising there are few if any Private reviews on Rural or semi rural punts I decide to venture out whilst in NSW a great place to punt. This is one of those reviews. Searching the local papers there is little choice so I took a punt and made an appointment with Lynette. A pleasant enough lady in a specially designed massage room out the back of her Springwood home. It was a bit bloody chilly so i was grateful she had a heater warming the room up. Prior to booking I rang the number out of the Gazette under Therapeutic massage. There being little choice instinct suggested that "Relaxation" was what i was after and hopefully might be rewarded for TOFTT.
Well I stripped till I was a little Blue (well I was in the Mountains) so the cold weather made my colour feel right at home. I could only hope my balls would not be the same colour as those famous mountains upon leaving.
Intel had suggested that this may be a bit hit and miss so I was punting in every sense of the word.
The massage started and was rather pleasant. There was no sign early on that this was going to be anything other than a straight massage. The buttocks however got a really good workout as did my legs and lower back. There was no sign of a towel to cover me up so i was hopeful when or if I was asked to roll over my aroused state might signal some desire to be touched and teased and tossed as well. 
Not knowing what was going to happen and anticipating what might happen is half of the pleasure of the imagination which at these times is usually busy working overtime trying to settle the nerves but still longing to imagine the things that might be going to come.
I spent a good 45 minutes on my back with little hint of any incidental touching. Whilst on my front I squirmed with anticipation and I am certain Lynette noticed that. After 45 minutes she asked me to turn over by saying its time we did your other side as if I was a turkey who needed basting. I smiled. I turned over and she started by giving my head a good massage. The conversation that had started for the first ten minutes of the massage and then lulled as i was enjoying the first stage of the massage began again. Putting Lynette at ease was what Biggus was aiming at and succeeded rather well. After the head next the feet and I started to think this massage was going to be a straight one. My old fellow was standing at attention when i rolled over and after not receiving any attention had gone flacid. After she finished the feet she came up and stood at my side and started gently stroking her fingers up and down my body first on the legs and thinghs and up from my toes to my shoulders. Bugger i thought this does not look good. But just as i started losing hope the incidental tackle touch happened. Then the not so incidental touching started bringing me to attention again. She smiled and said "we cannot ignore this part now can we?". I smiled and a warm feeling of arousal came over me. I thought then I must remember this as I was looking forward to the review almost as much as what was going to happen in a few minutes. My hands started to wander and there was only a slight amount of protest as I freed her lovely tits from their restraints. I thought Now they are just lovely small pert for their age and a delight as this punt was working out. I exploded over myself a few minutes later. I didn't explore any further cavities or areas as I wanted to be able to return without embarrassing myself in the future. There will be plenty of opportunity at the next visit. Lynette cleaned me up and the massage was now over. I got dressed and paid her and left. With a big grin. Often punts which there is varying intel on prove a waste of time and money. This one worked out well.


Not that the massage was the best or even half decent but because I TOFTT and came through with a great result. There is a tugger in dem der Mountains. I am certain there are others. They just need to be flushed out and reviewed.

Now I shouldn't have to say this but after a review i did in Melbourne I feel as though I must state this. Do not approach this ML by asking do you do HE or a HJ or nude or anything like that. Go without expecatation. Being pushy is not the way to get your way. Relax and you will be relaxed. Do not mention anything about this site to Lynette. If you can't observe common sense pull your own pecker and leave reserved PML's alone.
Meanwhile enjoy and happy punting and endings.

Biggus.

I literally Laughed Out Loud. Sense of humour always makes for a great read. we need more of it I say! 

Biggus, may I ask a tactical question? In times like this when being uncertain if a happy ending is indeed part of service, do you completely disrobe (naked) indicating your anticipation of said event? Or do you remain modest and keep the jocks on?

Xav.

'Tactics for getting a tug with the rub' could make for a thread of its own! If you're at a massage place (or getting a massage) where you're unsure of if a 'happy ending' is on the menu, my suggestions are:

* jocks off. It's partly a 'sign' to the girl that you're up for it, and makes it easier for your aroused state to be noticed and acted upon.

* even if the massage place has a sign about leaving jocks on, or is an Asian place where they provide those fabric/paper pants, I'd suggest leaving them off. If a happy ending is definitely NOT on the menu, you will (at some stage) know, but if it IS a possibility, this will increase your chances.

* especially if the girl is Asian, ask her name early on (eg before you even strip, or if you forget, once you're on the table and she comes in) and give her yours. Smile, be friendly, talk to her a little bit during the early stages of the massage - which means asking about her, expressing interest in whatever city/country she is from, complementing her on her English (also ask if she learned it here or back home, if she learned it here then compliment her again on how good it is considered she has not been studying for long, and sympathise with her that Australians can be hard to understand!), talk a little about the food or music of her country â€“ basically, anything to get her to relax and feel good about you and her being with you. Again, this can help nudge a 'maybe tug' girl into a 'definitely will tug' territory, and if she's always been a 'will tug' then it can lead to extras.

* you don't need to talk for the whole massage, of course, just for the first stages of when she is working on your back. Then just relax.

* back in the realm of maybe/maybe-not: another good way to give a signal that you're interested is that when she is working on your legs, even if there's that towel covering your backside, spread your legs a bit; if she is working around your backside, raise your backside up a bit and give her a little 'sigh' and compliment her on how relaxing the massage is.

* of course, when you get to turn over, be sure you are 'standing to attention' and if she bunches the towel up over you to do your inner thights but keep your solid boy bits just covered (as often happens with massage girls who are a bit concerned about council inspectors), if she turns around to get oil or something, quickly nudge the towel over a little more or angle your little friend so he's peking out from the towel. Again, these can be little touches that help set up the scenario, so that she can 'accidentally' brush against you (to give you a clue to see if you want to take things further) or she can just get the hint that you're up for it.

Also, something I picked up from a massage lady I used to see 'outside' her work: at massage schools/courses, they're often taught that one way to signal that they do NOT do 'extras' of any sort is to have a photo of their husband and/or kid sitting on a table in the massage room. If you walk into a massage place which looks legit and you see a photo like that, then that's a 99.9999% assurance that this will be a rub-only session.

With deference to Hard and Flyboy I actually never ever wear underwear or rather never leave it on before getting on the table. If a massage lady doesn't leave the room when you undress then she probably isn't a well versed Professional. Modesty is something usually afforded to most clients as a courtesy. Believe it or not some punters don't want their jewels polished (I can say without fear I am not one of them!). The facts are that in every properly taught massage course draping for modesty is a big part of the etiquette stage. If you have someone who tells you to undress and leave your undies on you simply say i don't wear any and then walk out. The facts are Professionals know how to drape and deal with things that come up. They are polite and assertive if they do not ever cross the line.

But that is half the fun. Figuring out the signals on a new venture. Another thing if you are visiting someone who you think may do the tug but are unsure if she is suspicious about you (short back and sides asking a lot of questions because you are anxious or nervous not because you are from the Cops or the Local Council) is to disclose an occupation which will make the lady/fella relax and feel at ease. Of course you need a well rehearsed cover story. Being in the building trade puts most Ml's at ease. They massage lots of horny builders, plumbers, tilers, sparkies, chippies, roofers, fencers you get the picture. Avoid admitting to being a white collar worker because they become suss you are working for Council or a Gov agency.

Remember if you leave your jocks on aside from sending the wrong signal you have to get up off the table to drop your regies and that is awkward and ruins the moment! Besides that oil can ruin your Bonds / Calvins/ Bogans or ruin your other clothes in the wash.

As I stated I never leave them on and if told to leave them on (afterwards I fire my research team!) I always walk out after stating i never wear them.

You need to stand your ground on this or rather walk away on this principle. The other thing to do if your research team sugggests they cannot be too sure yay or nay is you simply don't wear any undies. That way if you really want to stay anyway to experience the massage they will need to drape or stare or glance perchance to peak. In any case it will always be a turn on even if you are not being touched. The imagination is a wonderful thing.

You will find places that do the tug that offer say an alternative style of massage such as Traditional Thai massage with shorts supplied for you to wear will not tug you with their shorts on you as they cannot flush the evidence.

Happy punting.

Biggus.

Hope I didn't create the wrong impression...! I also always remove the grundies. I agree entirely with BD's -  and Flyboy's - recommendations on 'getting your jollies'.

The topic reminds me of an occasion when I was asked - very politely upon 'towel slippage' a couple of minutes into the rub - to replace my grundies! 

I suppose it was a symptom of my spending far too much time in 'illegitimate' parlours but in retrospect, I should have known there'd be no way this particular (Caucasian) ML was about to perform anything other than a pure, wholesome and morally incorruptible massage. It was on a ship and so the slightest suggestion of impropriety might have had her in the brig! There was no suggestion of me walking though. The rub was pre-paid and turned out to be an absolutely superb massage... I returned for another later. But deviate that I am, I had to try it on...   

I'm further reminded of the reverse situation in a very pukka hotel spa in Cambodia. Paper pants were on, reluctantly but as obliged... but well into the massage as upper legs were being treated, the nice lady suggested I remove them. She then proceeded to provide an absolutely superb hand job. She actually used the paper pants to mop up... 

Aaahhh the thrill of the hunt...

I have an old friend, reasonably good looking, fully legit country girl who used to work at the Star Casino as a massuesse, about 15 years ago.  She had the pleasure one day of massaging a very very well known Hollywood action / martial arts star in his hotel room -  he tried excatly what we all are talking about here, except he took it a bit too far.  All I can say is shit hit the fan for everyone!

Good review Biggus, very similar to my experiences with Lynette more than 10 years ago as discussed in another thread.  I eventually gave up on her trying to get more than a tug and a bit of a grope, I persisted for quite some time and was a regular but I could not get her past a simple tug ( and her massage is pretty ordinary ). Perhaps now her son is grown up and her situation has changed she might be more ammenable to more services...
I eventually moved on to greener pastures but I could empathise with the wonderful sense of anticipation and build up that we get with someone unknown, it is certainly why I punt and why I have to keep seeing new girls even though I have some really good regulars that do it all for me.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Well, I was in luck this time! I'd seen Lynette a couple of times before late last year and the experience wasn't very memorable. No HJ, kept a towel on me at all times and the massage was generally quite lame. Not so this time!

Rang ahead and booked an appointment at 4.30pm. Lynette always greets you at the front and then takes you down the back of her place into a little massage studio. I have to say the studio is not too bad and it was nice and warm when I stepped in (freezing day too!). We proceeded to make small talk and exchanged cash before I started to strip off. I couldn't see any hint of her waiting with a towel so I thought "screw it, it's naked or nothing". Stripped everything off and lay on the table and to my surprise there was no covering this time. So, Lynette takes to her massage with a nice amount of oil and I can sense immediately that this massage is a lot more sensual than the other times. She was rubbing her forearms sensually over my thighs and butt, lightly caressing me with her fingertips and making nice, slow movements all up and down my legs. This continued for a while until she says "Ok, time for the other side!"

I flip over and by this point I'm quite hard. She lathers oil all over my front before getting to work. She comes centimetres away from my member numerous times, and each time I flinch with anticipation. Towards the end of the front massage she makes one smooth movement with both hands starting at my toes and strokes right up and over my cock and balls. She proceeds to lightly caress the shaft with her fingertips before greasing her hands with oil and going to work, all without a word said! She does have a fairly decent HJ technique, alternating between massaging the head and shaft with two hands to cupping the balls and focusing her pumping hand on the glans. After a few minutes of this I'm done, we exchange pleasantries and say goodbye.

All in all a pretty decent experience. Most of the satisfaction came from now knowing that there's someone in the mountains who won't charge too much for a RnT and is close to home! It's also less risky going to her house than an establishment on the main street of Penrith!

Hours of Business : By appointment

Rates : $50 30 minutes $80 60 mins

Age : Probably early 50's (According to Intel)

Size/shape :Very slender to trim 

Nationality or Ethnicity : The Old Dart Yorkshire Woman wid de accent!

Services Provided : Massage and smile

Value for money/recommend? : Yes and No. 

My experience/comments :

After having TOFTT with Lynette I decided to return so i could enjoy the session without having to remember for a review.

Well big mistake. I misread Lynette on my second visit. Perhaps she was not in the mood for exploring her boundaries.

The thing I noticed this time was she didn't leave the room. She drew the blinds and pulled the curtains together in her purpose built massage room under her house after having greeted me out the front.

She showed a little contemp for privacy which is never a good sign especially for a second visit. She was all about the biz now.

Had a little small talk about the weather and other stuff but was on the table fairly quickly and had the oil applied.

The massage was a little more laboured this time as if she was bored by massaging someone again so soon.

I guess with Lyn YMMV a great deal.

Whilst it was the same service (ending wise) the little bits that make the spend and trip worthwhile like the access to tits and crack were simply not there this time and not allowed! 
You know the story your many hands octpussy style groping and searching for something worthwhile to get you over the line and the D.O.S. there blocking your every move. Well after my last succcessful visit I felt this time was a real disappointment. But it was a second visit to test the service. Error 404 File not found was the message I was getting and the old fella was getting bruised with the strangulation grip that was being applied. So i laid back used my imagination and finally got there as I knew not to do so would end up me leaving the Blue Mountains without having a Mount and the Blues! literally.

I asked Lynette to release the death grip she had so my old fella stayed erect mainly out of fright. Fearing it might be used to strangle me I put him into some tissues. well a lot actually and asked for a wet towel/flanel and as that was forthcumming and so was I it seems I was still in the process of expelling my little men!  I wiped myself down dressed paid Lynette and thought well maybe I'll be back but no time soon.

Thinking how disappointing things can be when consistency is all you require and appears quite rare when it cums to tired jaded old cauc ML's.

Lynette is nothing special to look at. has a lazy way of massaging and is probably not worth anywhere near what she charges. The handy is just okay but pretty average unless you are deprived in which case its possibly the best handjob you have ever had...

so far this week! Not counting the one you had this morning,.

Ahhh The Imagination is a wonderful thing aint it?


Still I am exploring in dem der Hills so will punt and post reviews that I hope give some inspiration to others to do the same.

Meanwhile enjoy punting and don't forget to post a readable review!

I was on a mission to find more ladies out in dem der mountains dat do de tug.

Now being keen to provide variety I set my sights on booking and asking some ML's in da mountains for a booking and enquired what if anything might be on the menu.

Now it is very uncommon to find someone in the mountains that does a Rub n Tug so I thought I would simply have to TMFTT take more or many for the team.
So after making the appropriate some might say inappropriate enquiries I discovered that Holly Somers does not inspite of her website suggesting otherwise perhaps do any type of really relaxing massage as we know it.

Meet Holly &lsaquo; Holly Somers

So with that settled I booked with a lady who worked in a home clinic at Katoomba along with another clinic Springwood.

I travelled up the Mountain and arrived at the duly appointed time. Little to no intel here on this one by name of Nat. She works for an outfit that in advertising as is Holly S on Gumtree.

Infinity Health and Wellbeing

The fact that one does not and the other might do is always in the back of my mind. I chose the fugly one to try out. Figuring if the fuglies need the money they might go the extra mile.

Nat met me at her door. She is huge and I mean bigger than a sumo. Think she is of Indian extraction but dark skinned. This did not look good. She led me to her massage room which was kitted out with an hydraulic massage table. She asked me to sit down and fill out a form. I thought to myself with the way things look that TOFTT was a bridge too far. I started to sweat. I looked at the form and aside from all the usual things I won't even give my lawyer she wanted me to sign saying I wave any and all liability. BS. No way. I had a couple of questions for her and I was out of there. The pertinent questions asked prior to making the appointment. i am no fool. was do you do a full body relaxation massage. The answer came back Yes no problem. Oh ok so on that I made the appointment. No guarantees as we all know some of us interpret things differently. Most of us differently from most ML's I must say. 
Now the only question that remained to be asked was the pertinent one of "Do you do sensual massage?"

Silly question I already knew the answer as i had been told I have a Bachelor of Bullshitting in Health Sciences and can justify any approach to this business that i care to make up. We all know the type.

 Of course the answer was "NO!" I beat a hasty retreat making my apologies by saying I never fill out these forms which is true with the rare exception of when I have the option of a tug in which case I give them some BS name and info and sign away someone elses life. Apologies to Someone else.

Having struck out before starting I knew I had to make the trip worthwhile so I rang Lynnette. Booked in and reviewed as follows

Person's Name : Lynnette

Establishment : Lynnette's PML

Date of Visit : July 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Treat yourself to a delightful massage by Lynette. Relax. Renew! 4751 7289

Blue Mountains Gazette.




Hours of Business :  By appt but daylight hours.

Rates : $50 30 mins $80 60 mins

Age : Early to mid 50's

Size/shape : Size 8 to10 "B" Cups.

Nationality or Ethnicity : United Kingdom Yorkie.

Services Provided : Massage and smile

Value for money/recommend? : On this occasion Yes.

My experience/comments : 

After having attempted to TOFTT I decided on relief being the best option so I did not have to drive my joystick down the mount without release.
Rang Lynnette. Phone answered Can you see me soon. yes sure no worries big dick. We are on a first name basis.

Arrived at Lynnette's place she met me out the front then around the back to the purpose built massage room. Off with the gear and if you have read my previous reviews you will note I took a different tac. This time I was having  a short massage 30 mins. She started out and the session was different. she was way more sensual and was doing a really good job of turning my volume up. After 20 minutes I was asked to turn over please its time we attended tro the other bits.

Over i rolled and having avoided pawing her as I did last time I thought to myself nothing further is ever going to be on offer with this Ml and that is simply that.
After gliding her hands up and down the length of my body and doing a good head massage we went a little overtime. she didn't mention it but i was aware we were into the second part of the hour. She teased me and when Biggus started saluting the ceiling she applied a two handed tug and I managed to get access to the titties that took me over the edge along with the tactile feel of the nipples and my imagination closing my eyes i shot my load where she was aiming it. All over the place. After clean up i paid her with the pineapple and left.
I smiled to myself having eliminated two more ml's out of the equation realising there are more punts to be had and maybe more adventures. In dem der Mountains.

Old saying from the seventies. I'm a Mountain Man and I love a Mountain Women! Keep smiling.

Must say I am extremely impressed with your tenacity in this quest Biggus. I do hope you had other business... driving all that way for a tug possibility is risky at best!

I do have to say, I wouldn't have followed the "ugly is best" rule in this particular case. Any woman who tries to disguise herself dark-lit under a lampshade is extremely dubious value and from your form-filling description, sounds like she's quite balmy. If I was choosing, I would have gone for the 'pretty' one... inspired by this bit: "Katie will not only ease your tired muscles but will tune in to your guides and where required feed back valuable messages and spiritual wisdom to assist you in your life path." That's just what I need... someone to tune in to my 'guides'... who would have guided her hand straight to the point of most need in the hope that her 'spiritual wisdom' would have known what to do with a handful of pork... 

She does look attractive though... for your next Mount'in Man excursion, can we commission you to sus her out?

It is distressing to learn that Lynette may be the best the mountains have to offer. Maybe it's that culture up there with a surplus of females in the population... did you know that the Blue Mts has the highest concentration of lesbianism in the state? I'm not prepared to say how I know this however...! But I do wonder if all those frustrated women get 'happy endings' when being massaged... 

Mate, you are a champion... love your work!

Thanks Hard. Must admit I love the fresh air and antique shopping available in dem der Mountains.

Now when it cums to picking women at times it is best to eliminate the Fuglies first. 

Kinda like eating your veg and then enjoying your meat. Or having your desserts just before your mains and finishing with entree apre. 

I do enjoy the challenge and of course have noted the other Katie who could tug on my best matie. At least that is the deal. 

I confess I did have a plan which always tends to go to hell in the proverbial handbasket. Murphy alive and well. The fucking optimist!

I did find a nice antique table that I will pick up next week to match an antique hat stand bought the other week.

Only real problem with heading up the Mountains is the road fuckin works that have been going on for over a decade.  The Opera house took less time to build. And some of us remember the saga of that build. But the construction of the retaining wall is a sight to see. Engineering marvels.
If you have a chance go to the South of Sydney to the New Seacliff Bridge and spend some time in awe of the engineering feats that challenge some of our best and brightest and the solutions that resolve land slippage issues.

I do enjoy the challenge the Mountains present.

Only on days off though. 

Have some more time based in Sydney then off for new adventures interstate.


Biggus.

There used to be a woman who went by April who used to do sensual massage in a residential area in the Katoomba area. I saw her once 5 years ago but I am pretty sure she has moved on.
There was also another lady who went as Mercedes. Used to advertise in the Blue mountains Gazette. Have made some enquiries of her but never saw her. I recall she was reviewed on another forum. I think she was based in Wentworth Falls.

My experience/comments :Up in the mountains for business and decided to try Lynette. Seemed pleasant enough on arrival and showed me down back to massage room. Stayed in room while I undressed checking out my equipment which I liked. Reasonable massage but a little ho hum. Roll over she mutters about me only coming for the hj so she better get into it. Oil on the boy and a lacklustre handy began. My hand on her arse ok but I tried to grope her boobs and she abruptly told me to get away and pushed my hand away. All the while stroking my hardon. Managed to get over the edge a cleanup and friendly Lynette was back. All in all a poor punt massage 5/10 looks 2/10 handy 3/10 but for $80 all up just enough to satisfy the urge to empty a sack full. Don't go out of your way for this one.

It's kinda good to know Lynette is still at it up there in Springwood, teasing the boys but never really delivering what we are mostly all looking for.  I enjoyed reading this thread and had similar experiences to most of you, particularly biggus.  I lived only 15 min away for a while about 8 years ago and probably visited her 5 or 6 times over a 2 year period until I found better satisfaction elsewhere.  The funny thing is I kept going back trying to appeal to her soft side but in the end I gave up.  Once I nearly succeeded in knocking myself out on her low veranda roof leading into her massage room and after the first visit always managed to get her fully nuded up from the start.  Can't remember what she called it but something like her 'special' service.  By the end I had her rubbing her pretty nice B cup tits over my chest and rod once she oiled me up plus a gentle feel of then when I was obviously heading for the gravy stroke and a touch on the bum and even the back of my fingers on her bush, but that was about it.  She said if I was one of those men who wanted more, then there were plenty of providers in the newspaper for this.  Oh, what a shame as I really would have liked to fuck that woman!

Wow, this thread takes me back!
I used to visit Lynette on and off from '97 to '02, about once every two months. The best I got was similar to drillr a tit rub over my back and butt, cock, chest and face. I got to suck on her nipples and slipped two fingers in her snatch. I gave up after that because it was too much effort (with plenty of knock back) for little return, plus there was 'easier pickins' at the time in Penrith. So I forgot about her until now.
It;\'s nice to know she's still active. Hmmm, I wonder???

Person's Name : Lynette

Establishment : Private Home Springwood

Date of Visit : late Feb 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : as above

Hours of Business : daytime only

Rates : $80hr

Age : 50's

Size/shape : slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : English

Services Provided : masage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : meh,

My experience/comments :

Was working in Cowra this past week and decided to head back to Sydney last Friday to drop off a bunch of stuff at the office. Had a quick pitstop in Katoomba at the Savoy and squizzed through the local papers. Was looking for a massage place to sort out some tightness around my shoulders and neck. Spotted her ad - which says ESSENTIAL MASSAGE for you. A relaxing and therapeutic massage by Lynette 4751 7289.



Made a booking and drove my way down to Springwood. It was an easy drive now that it is dual carriageway and arrived there with some time to spare. Parked and headed to her place. She was quite pleasant on arrival and showed me to her work room with a massage table. Dealt with the finances and hopped onto the table. She was present in the room when I undressed and I wasn't fazed with her checking me out. Started off with a reasoanble massage and I pointed out the areas that were a bit stiff and needed work. We chatted about stuff and soon it came to turn over. She massaged the front and I asked if she offers anything, which she responded that she only provides a handy, nothing more - no touching, groping or feeling her boobs. I shrugged and she continued with her massage on my front. It wasn't long before she put oil on my cock and started the HJ. It wasn't crash hot and during this part ofd the service, she was cold and distant, concentrating on trying to get me to cum. It took a while  (and a lot of imagination) before the tadpoles were released. During clean up, she reverted to her firendly self and pretty chatty. 

All in all, an ok massage - good for the place I was there (I needed a massage), but nothing more.

I go up the mountains quite a bit and there is bugger all there.
There used to be a woman who's name I forgot that had a place at Wentworth Falls on the North side.
At that stage she would have been late 40's to early 50's, great body with a tan and short dies re hair but a bogan accent. Told me she used to work at a high class place in the city but I can't remember the name of it.
This is over 10 years ago though so long gone and too old now.
Penrith is the only place for ladies if you live in the mountains.
Nothing in Lithgow from what I can see also.
Cheers chaps

Value for money/recommend? : OK, did the job

My experience/comments :

I was in Springwood for work and decided to try Lynette for old times sake. Calling and setting up a time was easy, she saw me right away.

She greeted me out the front and led me down the side of the house to the back where she has her massage room. I opted for the hour and tried to strike up conversation to try and soften her up she was rather blase and wasn't interested in the past, I got my gear off, she always stays and always looks, and hopped on for a massage.

Lynette's technique is soft and flowing (to put a positive slant on it) neither is it structured, firm or remedial in any way. On the flip she gets to work on the chest and works her way down to the groin. She's effective and get me hard pretty quick, and is OK with touching and squeezing of her arse and working your way up her skirt, but she kept her elbows close not allowing any groping of her sizeable boobs. Maybe another time. She was jerking me off away from her so she wouldn't get sprayed and I blew all over the edge of the massage table on the floor. I had a weeks worth and I don't think she was expecting a massive eruption.

All in all she got the job done, I wouldn't go out of my way, but if I'm in the area I may call in from time to time.

The last time there was an ad in the Blue Mountains Gazette was Dec 2017. The number has been disconnected but that only indicates the landline has now been removed.

If someone would care to PM me her address then I could pop in on my way up the mountains.

Likely however she has moved on or retired or other.  

I will report back as soon as I receive a PM with her address. And no I don't have it stored anywhere.

SR.

 Ria (massage) - Newtown - 0416 351 130
				
Post Content: 
[Please note: her advertisement is no longer on Gumtree, so perhaps tell her that you saved her number from when she was advertising].

Person's name: Ria

Establishment: Private apartment 5 minutes walk from Newtown Railway Station

Date of visit: October 2014

Contact details: 0416 351 130 (text messaging is the easiest form of contact)

Hours of business: Contact Ria

Rates: $50 for one hour massage

Age: Mid-to-late 30s

Size/shape: Dress size 10-12

Nationality: Maori (although I assume she has been living in Australia for quite some time)

Services provided: Massage (and you are allowed to relieve yourself at the end)

Value for money/recommend: Yes

My experience/comments: Ria used to advertise on Gumtree and she had the standard "no sexual services" caveat in her ad. Despite this, she does allow you to relieve yourself at the end.

Making a booking was easy enough via text messaging (I don't think she answers her phone too often). I am given the address on confirmation. Her apartment is a five minute walk from Newtown Railway Station - easy to find in my experience. If you drive, you may have some trouble parking near to her place.

I knock on her door and am greeted by Ria. She is Maori, mid-to-late 30s, 5'5", dress size 10-12. The apartment is quite small, but there is ample room around the massage table for Ria to still give you a great massage. I am offered a shower but decline as I showered just before I left home. She asks me strip and I ask is it OK if I have the massage un-draped, which she says is fine.

Ria advertises as giving a Lomi Lomi massage, but it is not the traditional Lomi Lomi (i.e., with no towels on the table and under-body work done). Despite this, the massage was excellent and still incorporated long flowing strokes. It is one of the best massages I have had.

As I am laying on my stomach she is sure not to brush my balls or anything. On the flip over I am fairly erect and she covers my eyes with a wash-cloth to block out any light. As I am on my back and she is working on my legs, she begins to work closer to my balls (but still no touching). I adjust my cock and balls and she doesn't say anything. A few seconds later I give my cock a few strokes and she doesn't say anything. Again, a few seconds later I begin to stroke my cock and she says nothing. I take the wash-cloth off my face and ask her if what I am doing is OK - to which she smiles and replies "sure."

Stroking away I ask her if she wants to stroke me, which she declines. I forgot to offer her money (perhaps she will stroke you for $20?). Anyways, I am more than happy to do it myself while she watches/massages my legs. I cum, she cleans my whole body with a wet towel, and I am offered a shower which I decline. I give her the $50 and I am on my way - very nice woman.

Will I be back? No - but not because of poor service. The massage and service was great. It is just I have ticked her off my to-do list, and I will try something else. However, in my opinion, $50 for a (great) 1 hour massage where you are allowed to relieve yourself is good value.

Hi rabman, thanks mate! She is average looking. Not ugly, but also not a glamour.

Edit: She told me she is studying personal training, however she is carrying a little bit of flab (just a little, and I think she is conscience of it because she told me she wants to lose weight).

I would say, think your typical Maori girl in the street carrying a little bit of weight, but not much.

She is not "easy on the eye", but is also not "difficult on the eye" - "average looks" is a good description.

She had nice tits though, C-cup - so if anyone is a tit man and you offer extra money, she may get them out for you.

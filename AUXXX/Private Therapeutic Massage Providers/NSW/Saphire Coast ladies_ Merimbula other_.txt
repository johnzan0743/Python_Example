I suggest that you always do search of the site which will show what is on here. Using Advanced Search field available on the Right upper bar under My profile. For Meribula there is one historical review, see http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f117/s...24-980-a-4894/.

Otherwise suggest you check Locanto and Cracker etc.

Thanks WOTAN010 - found Sasha's review but was hoping our fellow members had some additional experiences they could share.

I think if other members had any information they would have posted a Review. What about Locanto, Gumtree, Cracker etc, have you done a search there?

No clue , is there a local rag covering the area, Merimbula News, sport and weather | Merimbula News Weekly ? Try No Cookies | thetelegraph.com.au or maybe Fairfax covers there?

I fear you may have to go further afield.

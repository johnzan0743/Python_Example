I understand that normally you would want the details, and I have a policy of only reviewing positive providers since I don't want to damn a potentially good WL due to one bad experience

However

All I can say about this is STAY CLEAR!
Photos are fake, and it is not a private WL situation.  Looks to me like a Chinese people trafficking setup.  Nothing positive and plenty bad, so do yourself a favour and move on past this ad!

Enough said

No reviews since October 2018 -  I could not find many good ones from you!

This forum relies on hearing about good and the bad experiences.     If we only posted the good experiences the value of the forum would be lessened.

Please always complete the template with full details of what happened.

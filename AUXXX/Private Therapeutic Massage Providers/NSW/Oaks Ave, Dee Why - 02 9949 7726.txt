Yes I have visited,  actually based Beacon Hill / Narraweena area,  almost Broovale actually.  Usually 1 lady working,  actually a very decent massage and an enjoyable experience for $60 for 30 mins.  No extras available,  nice lady very friendly.  Not most sexual or crazy experience,  but if want a decent massage,  and a decent play with the old boy then this could be 1 for you !

I have been a few times over the years..... She is a very nice girl that gives a vanilla massage that is relaxing. I am sure there is just one girl as i have never seen another lady there.

Visited today and can recommend this place.  The massage was great and very technical - she definitely knew what she was doing.  The tug was nice an slow with 2 hands working.

I agree this place probably only has 1 girl.  She said on the phone there were 2 but I didn't hear anyone else.  They are moving to Dee Why in a month or so which will be better as the premises are not the cleanest.

She was naked and not too bad to look at, she didn't get close enough for a good grope but didn't mind me playing with her tits.  she said the girls were 30 but I'd put her more in the early to mid 40 range.

the quality of the massage was exceptional so I'd definitely return again 

Cost $60 for 30 mins including happy ending

I agree. I have seen this girl a couple of times and she does give a very good massage and a good tug at the end. She has a good body with nice tits. Face is not the best but for $60 for a 30min rub and tug from a cauc it is good value and I will visit again when on the northern beaches

Visited again yesterday and must say this is probably one of the best massages available on the beaches...

She has now moved to new premises in Oaks Ave, Dee Why, right near the junction with Pittwater Road.  The place is in great condition and way better than the property she was at in Beacon Hill.  No sign of a shower though, which would be a great advantage.

The number is the same 9949 7726.

She also mentioned she is starting interviewing extra girls starting next week, with a hope to find ones with massage qualifications.  As long as she can get them she'll have a decent niche in the market.

I remember when I was young and impressionable, my girlfriend stood there staring at me for a second, then blurted out "You look like a horse!!" and fell about in fits, like she'd just discovered the essence of me. I was mortified, but my feelings didn't come into it for her. We actually continued for another 5 years! Oddly, I don't have any horsey features, like a long face, big teeth, big nose or anything at all.
But here is a guy who has real horse problems: &#x202a;El Hombre Caballo _ The Horse Man&#x202c;&rlm; - YouTube

I posted the above content twice (by accident), but didn't know how to delete the second one. So, I just gutted the text and put these words in instead, to meet the minimum requirement. 

How do you delete a post? 

Also, I note that after some time the 'edit post' option below disappears, when and why does this happen!??

Seems like some upgrades need to happen to this forum's architecture. Check out Delphi.

Hi matey2,

The "Edit Post" option is only available for 15 or 20 mins after posting. This is by design, not because the forum needs upgrading.

If you miss the window to delete or edit a post please send a PM to a moderator and we will be more than happy to do it for you.

Cheers,

BAB

Hi naaraguy1986,

Thanks for the post. By the sounds of it, I am sure your fellow punters would most appreciate a full review.

Person's Name : Summer (The only good one of the bunch I have seen so far)

Establishment : oaks ave dee why

Date of Visit : 21/3/12

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 9949 7726

Hours of Business : 

Rates : $65 half hr

Age : Late 20s

Size/shape : Blonde hair, short, decent body, nice breasts

Nationality or Ethnicity : australian

Services Provided : massage plus hj

Value for money/recommend? : Yes 

My experience/comments : Summer is great! I have seen her twice in the last month and have loved both visits. She is friendly and fun and give a good massage. It is great that she is a white Australian. After a good massage which included a great foot massage it was time for the fun. She gave a solid HJ which was even better with looking at a tanned young blonde girl rather than an old asian grandma like some of the other places in Dee Why. I will be going back again!

Person's Name : Jessie

Establishment : 7/9 Oaks ave Dee Why (Above Fish and Chip Shop 1st Floor)

Date of Visit : 6/6/2012 

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 9949 7726

Hours of Business :

Rates : $65 half hr  $85 45mins

Age : Said 29 but maybe 35

Size/shape : Brunette hair, flat stomach, great breasts, big angel tattoo on stomach, trimmed

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian

Services Provided : massage plus hj

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Great massage and service all round.  Paid for 30 mins but extended after 5 minutes, had a feeling I was onto a winner.  Not often u find an Aussie rnt for $65 per 30 mins.  Didn't ask about extras.  Not a clock watcher and probably spent 55 mins in the room.  All up a great experience.  If you don't like a talker then Jessie is not for you.  Seemed very busy with the phone ringing often - so take a punt and book ahead.

Well I will say these girls led by Cath aka Sylvie are workers who are carying on a tradition of massage for almost 20 odd years. yes they are caulks yes they represent vfm and yes the odd one or two will do extras.
Cath used to work in a stable of massage girls run by Nicole. she used to go under the name of "Magic Fingers" and held business rego in that name. I think she may still own the rights. Nicole had a successful r'n't business in Neutral Bay as well as Rozelle on the Balmain side of Darling St.
We may all owe a lot of gratitude to the pioneers of the massage industry to Nicole. She has trained more girls in massage than Yana ever did. Yana used to have places in Eastwood, Burwood, Harris park Chatswood (2 shops over the years) along with Parra. Most are still in business in one way or another. Probably most best known aside from Bodyrotic at Five Dockl where Rose oil was used to draw punters back to the business. If you left there and went straight home the neighbours would know where you had been the scent was that strong.

Cath is a great masseuse. She is one of the best talcom powder experts in the biz if you don't want oil. Tackle tickle and feather massage techniques all good from this girl.

She is a good value good hearted individual. She does not do extras and probably would not really interest most punters in that way. Most girls who don't want to do extras use techniques such as hurrying up the hj to avert the rising tide of aggression in the client. Most are successful and the girls will say something like..."you didn't really need the extras now did you?" as they wipe your jism from the table or their faces...

This girl is vfm as are the few on the Nthn Beaches if you find those Caulks who perform massage with hj. They are mostly giving value but if they are working in this establishment are not interested in doing extras and probably should not be visited if this is what is in mind. Refusal often offends and always is a source of laughter for the staffroom. Try it on the wrong girl and you may find yourself getting a really hard hj next time you visit. BTW that advice is not pertinent to this place but to most places that are small setups with regular girls.

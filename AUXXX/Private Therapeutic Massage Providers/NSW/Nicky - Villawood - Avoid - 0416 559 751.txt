Value for money/recommend? : No she is clueless but cunning like a rat. Not someone who I would trust with anything. To be blunt you would have to be kidding.

My experience/comments:

I noticed this one in Gumtree. Had taken details before but hadn’t followed up.

I realised she might be up for a nice massage when I discovered she. Had two Gumtree acts and was advertising using both. Follow links.

She appears to be smart and the routine is after she gives you the address she then says you must come 15 minutes early.
The address she gives is 23 Alcoomie St Villawood . 

Now when you arrive you realise this is a vacant block and she doesn’t tell you but you need to message her there and she gives you a drip feed as to her place.

I don’t play games with PML’s unless I pay for them. 
I asked was this a windup as I was going to leave. 

She then gave me her address which is around the corner in Lowana St.

FMD I was on high alert now.

Alarm bells ringing.

I go to door and rang bell. A short unattractive dumpy 30 something opened the door.

I was ushered into her massage room to the left. 
It was the same as in the pics on her ad save for there was not a box of tissues as in the pic on her ad.

She said you pay now.

I said I pay on conclusion.

She said it doesn’t work like that.

I said why not I have the money here why do you want it up front?

She said I have experience with customer in past. They say my massage no good and they no pay.

I said I am happy to leave money out for you. She insisted on money upfront.

I was ready to walk but decided I will now play her at her own game.

I said I pay you for one hour $50 and then I will ask for the massage to be at end and I go or I ask for further 30 minutes and pay you extra $20 at conclusion of massage.

She said okay. So I handed her a pineapple. She then says the words I was half expecting . You leave underwear on. I say sorry no can do Give back my $50 and I will go.

She was not expecting that so I removed the pineapple from her grasp and went to leave.

I said to her it is apparent to me why you take the money up front. Your massage clearly is wanting.

I then left.

No confrontation. She was compliant with the instructions given before I left.

Clearly she doesn’t charge a lot but also doesn’t offer anything that readers would enjoy or expect.

My verdict is give this timewaster a wide berth.

Nothing but grief to be had here. Unless you enjoy wasting your time.

Hey SR, thanks for the review.

I did want to ask though, some providers are legit and will ask you to leave underwear on.

Judging from her ads on gumtree, it looks like she is advertising a legit service, so I'm not quite sure what games were being played (besides the address shenanigans).

Couldn't you just ask upfront if you can have the massage un-draped when you called, to save yourself from this kind of scenario?

Cheers,

I think you missed out by haggling. There was a postive review somewhere but can't seem to find it.

Nah my radar was going off something severely. She is a control freak. The subterfuge was the thing that set my radar off. Initially. She didn't present as someone I would want touching my jewels. So when she said the undies stay I had already read that as something that was going to be next on the checklist.

It had all the good signs. First up however...

 Perhaps she is somewhat careful but the thing that suggests to me that she is not doing anything extra is the fact that guys are walking without paying. That speaks volumes if it is true!

Still I thought I was wrong before once in the past. But I was just mistaken.

If anyone has had any luck as in a decent f... rub or has knowledge about this individual then please add to or retrieve the link. 
I am always open to correction. ...normally have to pay more for this though...

Wach perhaps it could be another in the area. There are a few privateers in this Locale...


I should also point out that she didn’t tell me I would have to contact her upon arriving at a false address. If someone else had made an appt with her chances are they would have gone fuck it then driven off...

Bluey. Yes I could've used The "Cartman" Method. However I never as a rule (some rules can be bent) have a massage with my undies on. 
The game playing happened on the phone whilst making a booking. She is rather dogmatic in her approach. Out there. 
Once the time had been confirmed she then said by text for me to arrive 15minutes early.
That was something I queried. She said In case you get lost or get into heavy traffic. WTF?

I knew something was amiss and figured I would find out soon enough.

That's why I wasn't surprised when I found a construction site at the address she gave.

I thought she/he is a game player.
So I insisted on having the correct address. She was guiding me street by street or so she thought.

I waited until she gave me the correct address. She had not bothered to tell me she had given me another address. 
Hence she set the scene in which she operates. Game playing from the start.

The fact there was no tissues said it all to me. The subtle changes indicated she used bait to get them in then took the money and I was not at all certain she was not a mere scammer.

Most of us have had someone charging for a service that was shite.

The game playing was evident. She could have told me that it was not the address she gave me. I would be directed from that address. Further she could have told me it was cash up front. And undies on.

It hadn't escaped her it was simply the game or part thereof.

Some play them for enjoyment some out of habit.

I TOFTT so did the correct thing and was not about to waste my time whilst being somewhere I didn't feel at all comfortable being.
And paying for that service.

It usually comes with leather and whips...

Really given her description why would you want to have any intimate action with her? Life to too fucking short.

I saw her a couple of years ago, no looker but did and acceptable massage and an awesome HJ I recall. I stripped her down, not because I wanted to, just because I had to to tick the box and move on.

This lady has been advertising on gumtree for as long as I can remember, but her current ads are new.  I remember that her former ad had one very negative review, something about her not showing up for an appointment.  I don't know how she managed to get rid of that review; normally on Gumtree if a review is attached to a particular advertiser with a registered number, it follows that advertiser around no matter how much they change their ad.

She only has to open a new account with a different email address. Reviews and accounts are email address based on Gumtree.

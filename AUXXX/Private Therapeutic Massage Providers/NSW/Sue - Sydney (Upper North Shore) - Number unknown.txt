 Sue - Sydney (Upper North Shore) - Number unknown

For all you granny lovers, this maybe the one.  Body shape-rounded.  Moves slowly and with some difficulty.  Works out of a private home in a dead-end leafy street on the upper North Shore, small basement room with pokey dark shower.  Offers nude R+T. Age about 60+. Height about 5ft, large breasts, round belly.  Massage is pretty gentle as you could expect, and certainly no gymnastics!  Doesnt advertise much, and just has the occasional customer. Touching OK. Price $50 per half.  Not a clock watcher. Don't say I sent you!

"Moves slowly and with some difficulty"

Pure gold. I just have this image of an old lady with a simmer frame shuffling around the room. Almost worth it for the experience alone. Is FS on the cards at all?

I believe she is a retired WL, so FS may be on offer.   No room for a walking frame- just a massage table and a bed.

How could I have missed this old GILF, "SUE ..." has been advertising in the "North Shore Times" and another NS Newspaper since 11/2011...when I first opened this thread, 

I had just had a glup of a cheap SHIRAZ and thought I better slip down to COLES and buy a packet of "Burger Rings" before I search Google on this GILF. NOW being a Baby Boomer, she may be up my alley, I wonder if she used to go to the TROC on George.........now kiddys if you want to know what music us oldies liked when we were 20 (in the early 1970's GOD we had "WOODSTOCK") go into YOUTUBE and put in "Leslie West" & his "MOUNTAIN" for some really heavy rock or "Alvin Lee" and his group "Ten Years After" or "Robin Trower" or "Wishbone Ash" or "Jefferson Airship"  .....when I first started going out with Mrs SeaRay, we used to go back to my flat and take our clothes off then put on a double set of Headphones then I would put "Frank Zappa" on my "AR Turntable" which has pure gold wires directly from the stylis into the AMP then we would fuck with the volume turned up, OK so we had a bit of weed before hand .......you kiddies know nothing what your Parents did.....I may try this old fucker out and see if she "fuckrocks"

Person's Name : Sue

Address: Turramurra - off Kissing Point Rd

Contact details: Unknown

Date of Visit : October 2012

Rates : $80 for 1 hour

Age : 50's - early 60's perhaps

Size/shape : large body with big boobs

Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie

Services Provided : Massage, HJ, touching

Value for money/recommend? : ok, but not everyones cup of tea

I saw Sue after reading the reviews here and thought I might give her a go.  She is a very pleasant lady who operates from a small room at the bottom of a house.  The massage was very soft and not professional at all and not in the same league as, say, Jenny from Hornsby.  Even the tug was soft and I almost struggled to get over the line.  She did the massage nude and she allowed me to touch her.  Sucked on her big tits and had two fingers in her cunt at one stage.  I think she likes a bit of play because she was dripping wet and said to fit another finger in after only starting with one.  Lol!  Loved that part.

I'm not sure whether more is on offer because I didn't ask so maybe others can ask the question.

Anyway I'm glad I tried her ( a bit of a fantasy I guess) but I'm not sure I will go back.  I much prefer a really nice massage to go with the happy ending and I think that is missing in this package.  But she is a really nice lady and I like her so all you granny lovers out there, give her a go.

After reading Brad's review I could not help myself and made a booking yesterday. Wish I hadn't. Brad is right about thing. She is a pleasant lady and does try to please. 
She is older and larger than I expected. The massage was Ok but weak and but I found the tug OK. As I said she is bigger and older than I thought and I was not turned on at all but did manage to get over the line. Not much more to say except I will not be back.

After being away interstate, I felt like an old fat hairy nude Granny playing with my Weapon and after searching through the Site came upon this P.M.L. and after ringing the number several times, an older Gentleman answered and said he has never heard of Sue and he has received several strange phone calls, MOD's COULD YOU DELETE THE PHONE NUMBER ON THIS THREAD the poor old bugger does not do massage & hand jobs...

Post Content: 
Person's Name: Talia

Establishment: Private

Date of Visit: April 2013

Contact Details/Address: 0431 338 621 - advertises on cracker. 

Hours of Business: Mon-Fri 9am-5pm

Prices: $150/hr

Age: says 29, but I would say early 40's

Size/shape: tiny skinny chick, but well presented tits, that turned out to be droopy, perhaps a c cup

Nationality or Ethnicity: Aussie? or Euro?

Services: Full-body massage

Value for money/recommend?: Not particularly... 

My experience/comments: Talia talks herself up on the phone, that's for sure. she sounds polite and gorgeous. Appointment easily arranged and when she opened the door, she has a gorgeous face! I was expecting a fit tall blonde lady, with d cup monsters, so was a tad disappointed when I saw the rest of her small frame. if she didn't talk herself up so much, it would have been a nice little surprise!

Booked the hour. massage was average, she uses plenty of oil, that seems to dry off as the session evolves. It was actually quite good for washing off in shower, but bad for body sliding, as the sliding didn't really work. So the sensual massage on the back wasn't very good. turning over, she pretty much got to work straight away. she makes some sexy eye contact and cheeky smiles and she tends to enjoy this part of the session, which is always great! I love a girl that enjoys her work! Good release and she loves to watch you, and get every last bit out. 

Shower and off I went, back to normality. I then realised, hey that was a tad quick. Looked at my watch, only just over 40mins had gone for my one hour booking! taking out showering, etc, she probably only did about 25min worth of massaging. 

So, sexy finish, but still very average. I wont be going back. she said she is only here for a few weeks anyway.

Superstar seeking!  Just save me 150 bucks... I was planning on seeing this girl today but your review has saved me.

A tip in return - I think this lady has a thread on page 2 "Bella - Rosebery - Bella - Rosebery - 0478 767 745" She is a 12ish had large double DDs and has a dark middle eastern look (my type of girl!) She charges 160 for the hour and you get the best massage ever (full body proper therapeutic as she is trained).  Only downside is she doesn't get nude (wears a lacy see through slip).  No really touching allowed either (a lil on the breasts).  Whilst $160 is a lil pricey the massage is really good and she has a nice clean private premises.  Also be warned she doesn't usually offer a shower... but she does wipe you down well after the massage and uses high quality oil.

I'll do a review in her thread shortly but wanted to give you the tip if you are after a good massage

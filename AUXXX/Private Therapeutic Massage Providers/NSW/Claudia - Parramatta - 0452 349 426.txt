My experience/comments :

I had my eye on this ad for a while, and had been searching for info in different forums and did not really find anything on her. Just older ads. I thought this was unusual since she seemed to have been advertising on and off for a few years now. Either way I decided to TOFTT and go for a 30 min massage as she offers on her ad. I think her base service is R and T but for $30 extra you can get full service. This means you're paying $100 for 30 min rub and tug with a CBJ ending and $150 for a 1 hour of the same. Add $30 to each price and you get full service for that time. On many other ads she seems to advertise full service only so just thought I'd get the confusion out of the way.


So today I texted her about 45 mins before coming, she confirmed. I got there on time as always and she tells me to wait for 2 mins. Fast forward about 6-7mins waiting in the sun she tells me to come in. As I enter, I'm pleasantly surprised. The pictures are real! She's actually a blonde MILF. The photos obviously seem to show more flattering angles and she seems to be using the same ones for a few years now but I found her attractive nonetheless. She tells me she wasn't expecting me to actually come on time as clients usually come 5 mins after the suggested time.


Looking around, she lives in a residential area and she has a massage table set up in a common kitchen and dining area. Fine by me, she tells me to pay and undress and I do so and so does she and I get on the table. Now I'm not a frequent customer of rub and tugs, but I can safely say the rub part of this one was up to scratch. The massage was pretty good. She massages your whole back, traps, and legs, and seems to know what she's doing. Not too soft, not too firm. I felt great afterwards too.


Then she asks me to turn over and we get onto the tug part. This is the part which I think brings the whole experience down a tad. She basically just applies a condom and starts CBJ. Now don't get me wrong, the CBJ was one of the better ones I've had, but it seemed rushed. The sensual sort of mood she had in the massage was lost here where I could tell she wanted to make me cum quick. Her handjob was also way too quick and I felt as she sucked me to orgasm, it wasn't at all the satisfying kind that's sort of slowly built up.


She wipes down the oil, we both dress and I head off back outside.


So summing it up...


Pros:
 - Attractive blonde MILF with curves in the right places I'd say
 - Great massage, clearly knows what she's doing as she works those knots.
 - Good CBJ


Cons:
 - Happy ending was definitely rushed.


Overall I'd say the value for money is there. I would be curious to see if anyone has had full service with her and how it went.

Has anyone had any luck in booking her? I haven't been able to get a response from her, but her ads are still being updated.

That's fairly odd. She's very good at replying every time I've texted her...

Ive managed to get a booking and cofirmes the time and was given the general locale of her place. Close to the appointed time and being in the area, i called and texted her to get the exact addreas, but the calls went unanswered and to voicemail. Left some messages on her voicemail, but didnt receive any call back or sms. Called just after the appointed time but no luck. 

Not sure with this one

Not certain but Claudia has been around for over a decade in this area. Parramatta and is not someone I would bother with too much. Unreliable along with YMMV service. If this is the prolific advertiser working and advertising under various aliases then consider yourself fortunate to have saved your cash. 
Simply put the more ads that proliferate the sites such as Locanto and Crocker etc the less likely you are of having a VFM time.

I see ads as being virtually inversely proportionate to the effectiveness of the service provided. I.e. the more the ads are placed the less reliable the service provider and the poorer the quality of service.

There are many examples of this. If you are any good you don't need to advertise or the frequency of the ads will be on low rotation.

Poser you have dodged a bullet be grateful. 

Just my humble opine. 

SR.

That's generally a red flag. Though even if I haven't booked she's answered my questions fairly promptly. I guess the old YMMV comes into play but that's certainly not great if it varies that much

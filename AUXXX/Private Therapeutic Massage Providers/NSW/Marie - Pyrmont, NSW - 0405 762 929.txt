Post Content: 
Person's name: Marie.

Establishment: Private apartment in Pyrmont.

Date of visit: June 2016.

Contact details: 0405 762 929.

Advertisement on Gumtree as of 25 June 2016: [I]Hello! I am a certified Masseuse since 2009. I have Australian credentials since 2014 and do private and professional massage therapy with almond and lavender oils to suit your needs. I have worked with rugby teams, dancers, various athletes, physiotherapy referrals and Thai massage training (i.e. walking on your back, stretches). I am based in Pyrmont, $70 for 1 whole hour of pampered massage or discounted for consecutive bookings/referrals. Get in touch if you like, my email is mkmassage7 at gmail dot com, bookings are essential. Link: Massage Therapy | Massages | Gumtree Australia Inner Sydney - Pyrmont | 1108804952

Hours of business: Marie does have an office day job but her hours are below.

Monday: 6:30pm to 9:00pm
Wednesday: 6:30pm to 9:00pm
Thursday: 6:30pm to 9:00pm
Friday: 6:30pm to 9:00pm
Saturday: 10:00am to 10:00pm
Sunday: 10:00am to 10:00pm

Rates: $70 for a one hour therapeutic massage (will let you stroke yourself - maybe more). Bulk purchasing visits gets you a discount.

Age: Early-to-mid 20s.

Size and shape: 5'2", 50-55kgs, petite, long black hair, brown eyes, A-to-B cup breasts, dress size 8.

Ethnicity: Maori or Filipino.

Services provided: YMMV. Therapeutic massage and will allow you to stroke yourself at the end (perhaps more after several visits).

Value for money/recommend: $70 for a one hour massage is value. If you could claim on a private health fund it would be better value.

My experience/comments: Searching Gumtree for a new massage adventure I came across Marie's advertisement. She included a selfie in her ad showing off her abs which I thought was strange/unique/showed potential.

I called her and asked my customary "do you mind if I have the massage done undraped?" To which Marie replied "sure, no problem". Awesome. I made the booking.

Arriving at her apartment I am buzzed up and shown into an extremely clean flat. I noticed a shoe rack to my left with about a dozen pair of (male and female) shoes. Student apartment? Perhaps. There was also a Maori bone on the wall and looking at Marie I think she is Maori (or Maori/Filipino).

Marie was dressed in black tights and a tight crop-top/singlet.

I'm told to strip down and she'll be back.

Her massage is incredibly firm and her technique got all the knots out of my back.

I flip over sporting a massive boner and ask Marie to work close to my balls because I told her I'm quite sore there. A few accidental brushes and I was stroking myself on-and-off which Marie didn't really mind.

Then, she finishes up. WTF. I ask if it is OK to finish myself off and she says "sure, go right ahead".

I also asked if she does anything more to which Marie said we can discuss next time. My gut is telling me she won't do anything more and is just trying to get repeat business.

Anyways, I came (to which she was nonchalant), paid, and we parted ways.

Will I return?: Yes, only once though to see if I can get more.

Thanks for reading.

I have had her saved for a while and also asked if undraped to which she had replied yes...but had never gone through with a booking as haven't had time yet. She is quite attractive though so might be worth it for massage along if you can go naked and stroke yourself! Interested to hear updates

Had seen her as a long time ago and inquired. She now has a boyfriend so things may have changed but she previously offered a HJ for an extra $70 or $80. There were options for nude as well but can't remember the price. When I said it was a lot more than I expected and that I would not go ahead, her reply wa that she was a certified masseuse and that she was not some Thai girl off the street.

This was all via and before even booking so it looks like she has changed since she has a bf.

She is a mix of Phillo and NZ.

Sorry, it looks like autocorrect changed ad to as. It's meant to say 'I saw her ad (ie gumtree ad)...'
She was too expensive so didn't go ahead. 

She first started advertising sometime last year and then went quiet for a while before she started again recently which I believe is the ad you saw.

As I said, it's was an extra $80 for a HJ. Her fully clothed, just a HJ at the end. That's what was too expensive. Wasn't worth going for just the massage as I already had a very good legit remedial therapist who is better looking.

Marie sent me a photo via sms when I inquired. At that time, she didn't put photos in her ad. Just went back to check and I contacted her in January 2015.

Rates: $80 for a one hour therapeutic massage 

Age: Early-to-mid 20s.

Size and shape: 5'2", 50-55kgs, petite, long black hair, brown eyes, A-to-B cup breasts, dress size 8.

Ethnicity: Filipino.

Services provided: YMMV. Therapeutic massage

Value for money/recommend: Hmm undecided. It is a great massage and she can really target the troubled areas but my overall feeling is that of a regular thai massage for $80 as opposed to $60.

Description: Marie has a killer body and a face which for me scores a 6/10. She says she is filo but she looks quite maori.

Anyway she is quite sweet. My massage was pretty much 90% focused on my back with 10% of the massage time being on my front.

No tackle tickle just a firm sports massage.

When flipped over with the towel on my flesh rocket she did massage really low on my belly and I felt her wrist brush up against my stiffy. I am pretty sure she kept looking at it although the towel was covering.

I was a bit bummed that the focus was on my back and minimal time spent massaging my front...

Will I return?: Yes to see if I can score extras

Hmmm, yes, shame. That's the vibe I got off her...

Thanks for taking a few for the team and proving my gut feeling, music_247.

Why don't you concentrate on posting your own reviews rather than commenting. I cannot find your review of her could you please post the link?

I didn't review her, I saw her privately and since I didn't know she was advertising services publically I didn't bother as I could not morally provide contact details anyway.  The post is relevant because it shows she does do extras so it's a question of when she becomes single again as that would be why minimal services are on offer

Spotted Marie while out today. She's very ripped and buff from alot of gym work. Had a very dark fake tan and appears to have gotten implants too but can't confirm.
Still has a boyfriend.
Her latest ad has her working hours as starting from 1pm now so she may have quit her full time job.

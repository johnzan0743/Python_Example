Comments:
I saw an advert for private massage in Blacktown and TOFTT. Ad read, "EROTIC Massage by warm & friendly lady 7 days." Called, checked prices (100 hour, 70 half) and I mistakenly assumed this would be nude b2b for those rates and that accent. The location turned out to be a private residence in Doonside. Made the appointment, got the address and rocked in before noon to find a 35 yo+/- yo Thai of almost Indian appearance. She said she was from Phuket and had just moved down from the Sunshine coast this week. She had a massage table set up in the bedroom. 
Went for the 30 min option. Looking through the little face hole and rubbing her bare legs a bit, I was disappointed there was no pre-flip TT. Turned over and despite the hints of my hands, the kit wasn't coming off. I asked about the nude option, told her how good I bet she looked naked, etc., but she still said no and explained that's not how they did it in QLD. I kindly let her know the competitive market and the rates and shops in this our wonderful punting region of greater Sydney. She seemed surprised that the normal Thai b2b shop includes a pretty good massage, fully nude AND with a body slide. Maybe she's been working at a legit Thai shop in QLD, as I had to give her a little more schooling on the differences in the anatomy of the shaft and the little head. Choking a chicken, flog the log, etc., are not the terms to describe my preferences, and I helpfully taught her where the nerves are and how I thought the ending should proceed. Oh well, despite the distractions of the sounds of her young daughter in the other room, and numerous calls which she thankfully did not answer, I got over the line and took a quick shower before leaving.  While she was pleasant enough, and spoke good English, the value wasn't there at all and I won't be back.

"Thats not how we do it in QLD". Hope you told her that she is in NSW, and her location is not really one people will travel out of their comfort zones to visit given that level of service.

Thanks for taking the hit for the team.

Yeah, agreed Maxwell. I genuinely wanted to give her the "lay of the land" and told her to call some of the Thai shops to check the competition and market offerings. I let her know she would not be getting repeat business like this and as a PML, repeat customers are better than randoms. Don't know if these girls get misled by some of the asking prices on Cracker/Syd Backpage/Locanto or what, but unless she comes around, I doubt she will be in business too long.

She has opened a shop in Wentworthville.  Saw the add in gumtree with same name and mentioned she previously worked in Doonside and Queensland.  The ad says $60 per hour with oil.

A search on Gumtree still shows it under Blacktown 'Clear Sea Thai Massage' but the address details are 4/6 Pritchard Street Wentworthville. However that address also brings up a beauty clinic and laser clinic. Sounding likely to be legit to me.

Person's Name : Dia 

Establishment : Dia Thai Massage

Date of Visit : 29/10/2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 4/6, Pritchard Street, Wentworthville 0468 916159

Hours of Business : Mon-Fri 9:30am - 6:00pm, Sat-Sun appointment only

Rates : $65/60mins $50/45 mins $35/30 mins

Age : mid 30s

Size/shape : very petite

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : Okay, for massage

My experience/comments : I saw Dia this afternoon. The premises are behind a closed Blockbuster and there is parking on site. The door is kept closed because its air-conditioned, but just go in without knocking as there is a reception area with a couple of seats. The massage room is well set up with a table that has a hole for your head and and I noticed an electric plug, so it can obviously be heated.

On entering the room she asked how long I would like and I said an hour and gave her the cash. She told me to undress and put my clothes in a container while she went away to get change. She didn't mention anything about undies so I removed them, but there was a towel on the table so I thought it was best not to push things and draped it over me. She came back with the change just as I was doing this. Her massage was good, not the best Thai massage I've had, but perfectly acceptable. She started on my back and moved down, and had no hesitation moving the towel down to the middle of my legs, so my dick and balls would have been completely on view. She did a good job on my bum, and then moved to my legs, again moving the towel completely off them so she would have had an unobstructed view. There was a bit of incidental tackle brushing, but definitely not deliberate.

On turnover she didn't bother with holding up the towel so she couldn't see, as some Thai mls do, but she covered me with it again, and then always kept me strategically covered, although there was again a bit of incidental brushing as she was doing my thighs and an inadvertent grab or two through the towel as she was applying pressure to my upper thighs. Other than that the massage progressed according to the normal Thai formula. No clean-up afterwards though so you're left with a good covering of oil.

In summary, a fairly standard and legit Thai massage. She is a nice lady, and we had a good chat during the massage. I may go back if in the area, but there are cheaper places around for standard Thai massage.

Mods, you wish to change the thread details since her location and phone number have changed.

She gave me the handy when I asked on a recent visit in early Oct, but she insisted on an extra $30, which together with the 65 hour massage is well over local rates. She rents the massage room the Indian beauty salon there, so she is a little concerned on discretion. Had I known it was her, I would have given it a miss. She had used the name Nadia in an ad, but Dia at the Shop. Guess I need to improve my record keeping...

Thanks dickbrown, I presume she remembered you from your visit to her when she was in Doonside? I'm guessing she's trying to establish herself more as a legit ml now and move away from what she was offering at Doonside.

Hey Chaz, she did not act like she remembered me, and I did not remind her. I agree that she seems to be more focused on the "remedial" therapy, so routine happy endings in the room rental situation in the beauty parlor could cause a problem for her. Thanks

Thanks mate. I went and saw her again during the week and it was the same routine as my first visit. She only charged me $60 this time though. I'm wondering if becoming a regular will see her offer a hj. I have to confess I like the excitement of the uncertainty!

Yep, and she took regular trips back. She obviously decided that she preferred to be closer to friends and family.

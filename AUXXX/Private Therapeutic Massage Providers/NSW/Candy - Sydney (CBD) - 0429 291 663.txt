My experience/comments:  

Candy is a petite asian girl with a gorgeous body, her massage skill so so, but she's excellent when it is time to turn around. The venue is very relaxing as well.

Candy is very early 20s, she is very good with her hands, offers full r&t, naked, and has a really pretty face. She is also quite civilised and appears to enjoy her job.

This one was on the third  page...Sounds interesting
Anyone bothered to find out if she's still working.

What have we been missing out on!

I meant the 3rd page on the listing here.
It seems a lot of punters only read the first page.
As I said, I'm marking this down for the next time I'm in the city.

Spoke to a lady today and she quoted $80 f/b nude massage...
She also said she now has a friend with her.
Asked about f/s and she said no...but I'm not real sure about that from the tone of her voice.
I was going to go in today but I have a unexpected busy week with o/seas visitors.
I'll have to keep it under wraps for a week or two.

If anyone else decides to take a punt, give us an update will you.

I will be ringing up and making an appointment for this Candy next week...Might take a double as it has been a while since I have had two.
Anyone of late been here?
Will report back after I have rung.

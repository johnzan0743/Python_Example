AYURVEDIC YOGA MASSAGE is a unique style that combines deep tissue massage with coordinated breath-work and yoga stretching. With oil and powder, the session is performed on a mat for free movement and flow. The deep tissue massage helps to remove knots and adhesions in the muscle, releases tensions and prepares the body of the receiver for assisted yoga stretching. This technique will help dissolve physical and emotional blocks, promote correct posture, improve respiratory patterns, blood flow, vital energy and leave the client with a deep sense of well-being.

Hours of business: Contact Claudia.

Rates: $90-$130 depending on how far away you live from Claudia. She is from Brazil, lives in Bondi, and can only visit you via public transport so the cost goes up depending on travel time/difficulty to get to your place.

Age: 34.

Size and shape: 5'4", 65kgs, short brown hair, brown eyes, really cute face, great arse, dress size 8-10, C-cup breasts.

Ethnicity: Brazilian.

Services provided: Claudia is an incredible case of YMMV. Straight massage to overnight stay was offered to me. Whether she offers overnight stays to everyone - I have no idea.

Value for money / recommend: Home visit massage which cost me $150 - maybe value for money. An overnight stay for an extra $150 - definitely value for money. I definitely recommend the massage - it was great.

My experience / comments: I saw Claudia's advertisement on Gumtree and we text back-and-forth regarding the price, etc. I also asked if it was OK to have the massage un-draped to which Claudia did not have a problem. She also did not have a problem performing the massage on my bed. I will warn you though her English is quite poor. I was unsure if she understood everything I was asking. My fears were alleviated when she arrived and everything went ahead as I had requested.

Claudia text me a few photos of herself before she arrived which I thought was odd but showed potential. Put it this way, she looked in her 40s in the photos, but was cute as fuck and not a day over 34 in real-life.

She text me when she thought she was about 10 minutes away so I popped a Viagra knowing I was about to have an un-draped yoga massage which gets me in all sorts of weird and wonderful positions - I couldn't wait for the CFNM experience.

Claudia arrives bringing oil and some relaxing music. We go to my bedroom where I ask her if it's OK if I strip down nude to which she replied with a smile "of course!" God I love the open-mindedness and cheek of Latin Americans. I was rock hard already and Claudia kept stealing glimpses.

Onto the bed and the massage is great. Front and back. All types of stretches getting me into positions where I'm exposing my rock hard cock to her. There was no accidental bumping. It was all quite professional which made the experience even cooler.

Claudia tells me the massage is over and I ask if it's OK if I relieve myself. She says that's fine. I offer her an extra $20 for a hand-job which Claudia accepts. $50 for her to nude up which she accepts. What followed was a pretty intense and awesome hand-job with lots of deep French kissing. I cum, get my breath, and we lie back for about 20 minutes exchanging some pillow talk. I ask her if she wants to stay the night to which she replies "how much can you give me." I reply $150 to which she agrees.

However, I fucked up. It was late, I had work the next day, and I was tired - so I changed my mind and told Claudia it's OK for her to go home and that she could stay another night. I've never got around to that.

My "common sense" tells me Claudia was new to Australia and didn't know the market value for her service. Perhaps the price has gone up in the past two months. Perhaps she doesn't offer sex/overnight stays to everyone. I simply don't know. But, I thought I'd share my experience with everyone here.

I will get around to seeing her again, and I definitely recommend her service (even if only for the massage).

Thanks for reading.

Maybe Cartman's just a smooth talker. 

She does sound tempting, if I make it to the Big Smoke soon...

The ads are 6 months old.  What do you expect?  No need to write posts like this unless you are giving a new link to a current ad. 

As per other posts, she is now working in a shop.

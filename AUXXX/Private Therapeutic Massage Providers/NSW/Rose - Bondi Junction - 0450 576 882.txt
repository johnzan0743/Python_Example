The ad is for a massage happy hours...

Happy hours | Massages | Gumtree Australia Eastern Suburbs - Bondi Junction

Name cleft palate

Place private address Bondi Junction

Date Mid November 2012

Nationality Thai by birth Aussie by marriage

Service strictly bad massage

Cost $49 hr special daytime $39 hr alarm bells ringing

Aromatherapy and free oil salesperson...samples are plentiful and free

Ability 2/10
looks 3/10
figure stick insect boys chest
Attitude 1/10

This person advertised in Gumtree and lied about mostly everything else...

Stated she had years of experience...surprise surprise the Tafe Cert 4 was awarded some 10 days prior...

It was on display along with a lot of smelly aromas...

Place was clean and private room a little cramped
massage was very bad...just glad it was only costing $49

Never went near the upper legs or glutes

Was glad when it was over and relieved to pay the money and run...but boy have i paid for this punt...
car now reeks of m/oil
Clothes had to be thrown out after washing three times in boiling water could not remove the scent..

Should have relied on years of gut and intuition to make me live up to the creed...

Should have walked away but thought this should be a sacrifice for a free membership qualifying review...

sadly this one probably shouldn't qualify for anything but my own ignorance of intuition..

All the signs were there... no touching anywhere that one might enjoy that includes parts which are normally massaged

left me much poorer as clothes were thrown out at least $100 worth in the bin..

Ah well such is life.

Lawson st Bondi J. not a place to visit if you want relaxation...

I wholeheartedly agree james... just that certain punters seem utterly unable to post a positive review. Do these certain punters never have a good experience? Makes one wonder why they bother being here posting almost nothing but a continuous diatribe of mindless negativity and historical judgementalism...

Over to you, "Dr x"...

Was in bondi for work and dropped in. She was quite flirty happy to see a new customer.
Stripped and onto massage table draped in towel, whilst waiting for her to return.
Massage was ok with decent pressure and coverage, removing the towel for certain areas that needed work.
She was willing to massage the glutes whilst partially removing towel, which got me excited.
On the flip she purposefully lowered the towel below belly and just high enough so i could keep my modesty, but low enough for happy friend to peak through.
She continued to massage the stomach which was a real turn on and the chest whilst taking in full view the towel that didn't cover much at this stage, things were looking up.
Once she started on the legs moved the towel back and started to get very close with her inner thigh work. I commenced to manually start things off and was surprised she didn't object. All the whilst coming very close to the upper thighs, it was too much and ended up finishing myself. After which is provided a tissue.
She didn't seem to mind and after the session said i was very cheeky with a flirty smile. Is there possibility for anything more here?

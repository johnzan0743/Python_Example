My experience/comments :

Had seen her genuine massage ad a while ago, and had found out she does erotic massage as well. After another member on here mentioned seeing her for that, I decided to try her out for myself. Her apartment is a little hard to get to and also hard to find a parking spot depending what time you go there, I didn't find much issue. Don't be turned off by the apartment, it's quite daunting but she is very pleasant and easy to deal with.

She answers the door in lingerie, and she has quite a nice body and a big bum. Her photos are genuine, but a bit old as she has clearly put on some weight. She holds it very well though and still looks great. After a quick shower, she sits you on a chair and gives you a very oily lap dance, inviting you to touch her everywhere except for insertion. After the lap dance, she takes you over to her massage table (there is a bed there too) and proceeds to give a very erotic, oily massage. Her massage technique is good if you ask for it, but her erotic massage is even better, with plenty of under the body contact with the lil fella and lots of body sliding, reverse and forward. DATY was not discussed but I went for it and wasn't stopped.

The session culminated in a pretty big explosion from me, an intense one after the build up. She helped me clean up, then I had a shower and was on my way.

I don't know if it's worth $200 an hour with no extras. I'm not sure extras are on offer down the track as she is VERY particular about her rules even down to the way you text her (read her add).

Also, FYI she has a $150/hr special for new customers. I'm not sure if this was available when I booked, I only realised this when I looked up her add for this review.

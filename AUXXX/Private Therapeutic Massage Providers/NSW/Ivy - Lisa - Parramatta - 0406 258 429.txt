 Ivy / Lisa - Parramatta - 0406 258 429
				
Post Content: 
Saw Ivy (also uses name Lisa). She is Thai and offers massage at a private location in Parramatta. When I called and she quoted 60 for half hour, I mistakenly assumed it was a nude b2b private equivalent of what you get in the similarly priced Thai massage shops. Wrong. 

She is a plump, 35 ish (she said 25 yo), not pretty, but pleasant, with baby fat, and large boned for a Thai (not your classic petite Thai girl), with c cup natural, working privately out of apartment in Para. 

She started with clothes on FBM for 60, I assumed it would soon be nude b2b (maybe she was a little shy to undress while I watched). Nope, she wanted 20 extra for nude. You can get full service nearby in Granvile for less ($75) with more attractive girls, but I was already subject to the tyranny of thinking with the little head. Once she was nude I asked repeatedly about FS. She started with wanting 70 extra (no value- $130 total for a half hour of FS with a very ordinary looking girl). I offered 50 which she accepted. It was a bad call, so I'm warning you the value is not here. She did no CBJ, but got right on top and started self masterbation while riding my cock. She looked like she would come like that, but since I was getting close, I decide to get on top in mish. She continued to self diddle, but the she mentioned the time running out (!)- so she does a little bit of an acting show in the name of service. Whatever. I came in mish. Looks 4, body 4, service 4, attitude 4, go back? no.

Doesnt sound so good. A friend of mine really had a good time in with a Thai girl in a Parramatta apartment but his description was much more positive. His girl was petitie with A cup. Was there a choice of girls - he mentioned five girls all Thai giving both straight Thai and and more. Thought he'd seen the number in a paper, but beign from out of town couldnt remember the address.

No, she was working alone when I was there, but said another girl would be working with her later. From my bad experience, I won't find out. There have been a few other private Thai "shops" in Paramatta that seem to come in go. One was on Sorrel St, and another on Pitt St in a house now demolished a few months ago, south of Para Road. That one had 3 or 4 girls/women of varying ages working there. A plump Thai delight named Amy was there, for $90/half, she would do BBBJ and rimming (would not have to ask), and then want to DFK. No thanks. I think they still advertise and I'll report back when I found out where they moved to.

Not so.

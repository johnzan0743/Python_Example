Hi Ryan,

When referring to cracker ads, it's always best to copy and paste the content, since after a few weeks the cracker ad expires and no-one has any idea of who you are talking about. It also helps others spot if and when the ad is reposted with different names or contact numbers

Here's Laura's ad...





			
				Hi
My name is Laura and I am a 31yr old university student who genuinely loves sex, erotic massage and accompanying men to corporate events without any underwear on.

I am a 5 ft 8, size 12, strawberry blond DD cup with green eyes and a welcoming smile.
I have a discreet luxury apartment near Surryhills with easy 2hr on street parking or an indoor garage for longer bookings.

I enjoy practicing tantric sex or any other fantasies you wish to explore. Or I can dress up my amble breasts and shaven pussy in an outfit you request - Elegant evening wear, Sporty, cheap& naughty, Sweet & Innocent, Stockings & suspenders or as Bondage Mistress in thigh high boots.

Complimentary relaxation time with a beer or wine is enjoyed on arrival.

A 1/2 hour sensual or therapeutic massage with nude body to body & reverse body slide is $80 or 1hr is $160. Spanish and mutual touching included. Other extras are $50.

1/2 hour full service with all of the above included is $200 or 1hr is $300.

I don't answer private numbers, don't kiss, don't do Greek and don't do any unprotected services e.g. French. I take your health and mine very seriously.
I have a friendly nature and always treat people with care and respect. However, due to lack of privacy if I am out and about or only have a short time between bookings, talking on the phone is kept to a bare minimum. For an important question not already answered in this add, I am happy to text you.
To go ahead with your booking please text two preferred times you would like and I will confirm if one is available.
I look forward to meeting you. xx Laura

I say go for it!
That's why the forum is here; to celebrate our success or act as a terrible warning for others!

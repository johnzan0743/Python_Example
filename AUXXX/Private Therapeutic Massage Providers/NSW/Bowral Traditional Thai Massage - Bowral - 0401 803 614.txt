There is a new thai massage shop in Bowral - about 6 months old - i think it was on Boolwey Street - next door to Target.  

Does anyone have the phone number?

My experience/comments : This mature howeve quite pretty lady used to work out of Wollongong (Crown Street) a few years ago.  Very clean premises, two rooms (not enclosed) and no shower.  Easy parking out the front.  

She provides a really strong oil massage  - however no extras available to me. 

She had a young girl there also so not sure if extras are avaiable from her.

My experience/comments : Cathy has been advertising in the Mercury here now for a few weeks and I finally got the time to pop in and see her. Unfortunately she had a room at Piccadilly Hotel which is a dive in the centre of the city that also provides rooms to junkies , women escaping DV etc etc. So it's not too enticing when you're directed there. Anyway pulled the hat down and ventured in. Knocked on the room door and she ushered me in too the dimly lit room. Well she wasn't in her 30s as she said and wasn't very attractive either but it's only $60. 
So anyway stripped off and lay down and she started the typical Chinese  I don't give a fuck about massage , massage. After fifteen minutes of almost falling asleep in boredom she asked me to turn over. Wasn't even hard. She then got some oil and started to wank some life into my pecker. She still had all her gear on at this time so I put my hand up her top and started playing with her saggy b cups. The mechanical handjob continued , same pace , same speed , same grip. Eventually she did manage to make me cum and after quick clean up I was back out of there with hat down and feeling quite gross.
would I return ? No. Value for money ? Only 60 bucks and did drain the python and allow me to finally complete my 27 posts. That was worth the $60 üëç

My experience/comments:

Had my eye on Lucy/Chloe's ad for a while and finally the planets aligned and I found myself nearby with time to kill and a bit of money burning a hole in my pocket. Pinged Lucy (as she was calling herself back then) and got a prompt reply saying she was available. Somewhat optimistically, I arranged for an hour to see what The Punting Gods would bequeath me on this day. As to be expected the standard private cloak and dagger shenanigans apply - I'm given street address of an apartment block and instructions to message on arrival.

I get there and am told to wait 10 minutes. Bit pissed, as she earlier said she was available. I consider walking, but find somewhere I hope is relatively inconspicuous to loiter and cool my heels. Bit under 10 minutes and some dude vacates the premises. At the time I figured it was a previous punter but with hindsight I think was more likely her "security" (really her boyfriend I'd say). He's soon followed by Lucy. I'm pleased to see she looks just like her photos! 

In to her apartment I'm handed a towel and told to shower. Out of the shower and Lucy has already nuded up (had nothing on under her jacket it seems) and leads me to the massage "bed". Lying down, it feels like a futon over the top of some packing crates...

Lucy's massage is firm but with only basic skills. Plenty of oil is applied. I'm massaged for about 15 minutes before there's a bit of a token attempt at a body slide before I'm asked to flip. Front side, up Lucy does a better effort at bodysliding (and doesn't mind me muching on her boobs a bit) before it is all to quickly over and she's lathering up melboy jnr. with oil. There's then a brief pause while she thinks she hears her "security" talking to someone outside, which causes her to freak a bit. I sure couldn't hear anything, so either she is superwoman or it is voices in her head 

Lucy then proceeds to tug melboy jnr. surprisingly ineffectively, trying to get me off and out the door as quickly as possible. With bit of coaching Lucy does succeed in getting me across the line. Meanwhile I notice her pet rabbit has appeared and is looking at my enormous carrot coated in white sauce hungrily, licking its chops...

I think it is this rabbit which finally pushes my wierd-o-meter past the threshold I can cope with and barely more than 30 minutes in to my booking I decide to call an end to proceedings. No idea whether Lucy was going to try for a round 2 or whether that was all I was gonna get anyhow - I didn't stick around to find out.

WIR? Thinking back, it is kind of surprising a girl who sometimes advertises such an extensive list of fairly extreme (and pricey!) extras can be so average at the plain old R'n'T game. I've a hunch that the presence of the security/BF is limiting both services on offer and even the quality of those that are. Also suspect Lucy has a few roos loose in the top paddock. But it is the crazy ones that are the best roots right?  So maybe my curiosity will get the better of me...

What happened after you walked? Did you pay the hour fee up front and have the difference refunded?

What is advertised right now is just the tip of the iceberg compared to what I've seen her advertise in the past. Service list seems to change frequently, keep watching, there'll be things appearing occasionally that you'll have to google (or at least I did)...

Nah, no refund. I'm gonna be lodging a complaint with the SW ombudsman...

"Newtown/Redfern massage table" - that's going straight to the pool room!

 But I can't afford therapy 'cause I spend all my money on hoes... its an anti-chicken-and-egg scenario!

Perhaps off to go see a toothless junkie hoe for a velvety smooth BBBJ in some dark alleyway down the 'cross followed up by a Glasgow kiss a from her juice monkey husband/pimp with arms the size of your legs and sick face/neck tattoos who then relieves you of your wallet?

Most likely “feline” who has been reviewed previously. Based on the rabbit.. I had a pretty ok FS session with her maybe 18 months ago.

 Carolyne - Campbelltown area - Locanto ad
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Carolyne

Establishment : Private

Date of Visit : 12 May 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Locanto ad
http://m.locanto.com.au/nsw/ID_83684...Therapist.html

Hours of Business : contact her

Rates : $100 for 1 hr ($150 HE, +$25 topless)

Age : 45

Size/shape  Size 10, tall, firm full C-cup breasts, hard nipples

Nationality or Ethnicity : Scottish

Services Provided : FB massage, topless, HE

Value for money/recommend? : Too expensive for regular sessions but enjoyable

My experience/comments : 

I was aiming to see a WL but she was booked out. Went to see Felicity at St Marys but she was late and mamasan tried to press older Asian WL on me so I walked. A young WL I saw as I entered near 10am was “not available as she’s going to school today” WTF?

So horny me goes for Plan C and rings Carolyne at Rosemeadow for a massage. I had contacted her a few days before to see what she offered so still had her number. The first approach needs to be by Locanto message.
Her normal service is FB massage for minimum 1 hr and that was quotes as $100 plus $50 for HE and maybe $25 for topless. She may do nude for $200/hr in total but not for first time clients.

I rang (she knew me from previous Locanto message) and negotiated 30 min for $100 topless.  This took some negotiation as she wasn’t really interested in less than 1 hr sessions but relented.

I fronted to an attractive blonde Scottish lass (her accent gives me a hard-on) dressed in black top and tights. Her photo is also in her ad. Paid the negotiated fee and laid down naked face down. She began the massage on my shoulders but I reminded her it was agreed topless. No problem so she whipped off the top to reveal she was braless and her breats were very impressive. C to D cup and tipped with hard pea-sized pink nipples. Verrry nice I told her to get a smile. I didn’t press for a feel until later but that was acceptable.

She massaged my back for a while and moved down to buttocks but I had to suggest some TT to get things going. She was happy to comply and just needs to be told what is wanted.
Soon I suggested a flip so I could admire her mammaries and enjoy her face while we chatted. I asked if I could feel her breasts and that wasn’t a problem as was a feel of her ass (over her tights). She said she has had some bad experiences especially with younger punters who ask for more extras including sex. She calls that “naughty” and won’t entertain those requests.

So she was happily playing with my boner and balls when I asked if I could kiss her boobs. She told me that is on the naughty/banned list so that was that.

Her HE technique was quite good and was happy to bring me to near cumming and then slow it down but on the second peak I couldn’t take anymore and unloaded a good cumload on her hands which bought a surprised ”Oooh” out of her.
She cleaned me up and sent me on my way after offering a glass of water.

This is a classy lady and punters should go there with the expectation of nothing more than a HE, a feel of her breasts and ass …. But that’s the limit.

Carolyne may be moving soon as the house she is in is recently sold. Hopefully she might head to Wollongong (that was a possibility she said) or stay local.

Hours of Business : contact her

Rates : $100 for 1 hr ($150 HE, +$25 topless) +$25 extra for nude. 

Age : early 50's I would estimate

Size/shape Size 10, tall, firm full C-cup breasts, hard nipples

Nationality or Ethnicity : Scottish

Services Provided : FB massage, topless, HE

Value for money/recommend? : Abit too expensive but a must try

My experience/comments : Have been meaning to contact this ML for a while as had her contact details from a while bacjk, just was not in the campbelltown area. Was in the area late last month and gave contact her via message on her ad - got a response with a phone number so called her and made an appt - very easy

arrived at her place, it is a very open address with the neighbours out partying on the lawn next door with cars all parked at various houses. didn't pick a  good day for discretion! 

carolyne is quite a good looking lady. very pale but okay figure for her age. she ushered me in and i asked about a sensual massage. no hesitation as she said that was $50 extra and $25 extra for topless and another $25 for nude! too expensive but her tits looked nice in the top so I opted for the topless massage. 

her massage is soft and sensual just the way i like it. as she played her spiritual music, i heard people taslking in the next room which turned out to be the bathroom. carolyne told me she had some tenants staying with her. if only they knew what she gets up to! or do they? anyway it was only slightly therapeutic with plenty of teasing of the sack and soft massaging of the arse and arse crack. she asked me to turn over in a very soft sweet voice

over I turned, she massaged my legs and chest then smiled like a little school girl as she delightfully got to work on my cock. i rubbed her arse, she was waering a very short skirt, and moved up to her tits. no refusal. as she kept tugging and i could sense myself getting closer I pulled her closer and sneakily moved my mouth close to her tits, no refusal! so i moved closer and sucked on those nice hard nipples which she really seemed to enjoy. needless to say it was a very hot 10 seconds, which I could not hold out any longer and spurted all over the place with carolyne making cute little sighs as she milked me clean. she cleaned my up and put her tits away, and offered me a shower which I took. 

was a very hot session and I recommend to give her a try! cute little gem, just a bit far for me over in campbelltown. not very good for discretion as I left the neighbours all watched me get into my car and drive off.

The advertisement has been removed which happens often on such sites.

This is why members should ALWAYS put the phone number separately in the contact details.

She still has an add up, but she never advertises her number which is why it is not in this thread. You have to contact her through locanto to get her number, she responds in a timely manner.

I have been to Carolyne once, about halfway through last year.  I have not done a formal review of that visit, since by the time I became a member in early January this year it was already outside the time limit for formal reviews, but I will give a brief account of my experience to supplement the reviews that have been posted here.

I saw Carolyne's ad in the NSW massages section of Locanto early last year.  The wording was quite different from her current ad, and it was not at all clear from it whether her massage was purely therapeutic or whether it included HE.  I noted that she was also advertising tarot readings and similar New Age stuff in the "Esoteric" section of Locanto, which suggested that there might not be any sexual element in her service.

Anyway, I replied to her ad through Locanto, since she did not give any contact details, but heard nothing back for several months.  In the meantime her massage ad disappeared, although her "Esoteric" ad remained; I surmised that perhaps she was essentially a fortuneteller who had tried to branch out into massage for extra income but had then thought better of it.  Eventually I got a message from Locanto asking me to comment on "Moonlightlady", the name under which Carolyne advertises; I responded that I could not comment on her service since I had received no reply to my enquiry through Locanto.  I then got a second message from Locanto saying that they took a dim view of advertisers who did not respond to enquiries made through their message service (which they provided to give advertisers greater security), and that they would  send her a reprimand.

Not long afterwards Carolyne's ad reappeared, albeit with somewhat different wording that was a bit more suggestive, but again with no contact details.  Once again I made an enquiry through Locanto, and this time she responded quite promptly in a very friendly way, informing me that her service consisted of an hour's massage for $100, with an extra $50 for hand relief if I wanted it.  She also gave her phone number. I wondered if her promptness was due to a rocket she had received from Locanto.  I responded that I would make an appointment the next time I was driving up from Canberra to Sydney, since Rosemeadow represented only a minor diversion from the highway.

I have to say that I thought the total price of $150 for an hour to be a bit steep, since in Canberra one can get a one-hour massage with HR from two Caucasian private operators for $120 (clothed in one case and fully nude in the other).  I wondered whether the $50 was for nude HR, but I did not make that enquiry since she had not stated that in her reply to me, and I feared that I might offend her.  Despite my doubts, I messaged her from Canberra and made an appointment for the next day when I was driving to Sydney.

I arrived at the address she gave me in Rosemeadow at the appointed time of 5 PM, as it was just starting to get dark; I noticed the prominent "for sale" sign in front of the house, which threw me a little.  Had she given me a phony address?  That was something I had experienced a couple of times in the past from MLs who obviously did not want to see me but preferred to play games rather than give me a straight answer.  I knocked on the door, and fortunately Carolyne really was there to welcome me.

My initial impression of Carolyne was very favourable.  She in no way looks like a typical hooker, but appears rather shy and demure.  She has lovely long blond hair and a quite pretty face, looking like the sort of attractive mature woman that one would like to meet at a social occasion.  She also has a pleasant and polite way of talking, her accent seeming to me English rather than Scottish.  She invited me into her massage room, which was obviously also her living room and perhaps also her bedroom.

I undressed and stood waiting for who to do likewise, but there was no sign that she was going to remove any of her clothing for the massage, and I was a bit too shy to ask.  That was a bit of a let-down, since she looked as if she had a rather voluptuous body under her t-shirt and skirt, with nice wide hips and large breasts.

I lay down on her massage table on my stomach and the massage commenced.  It was a very light massage, basically just rubbing, and was not really sensual, in that there was no gliding of her hands between my buttocks, no touching of my balls.  In fact, after about 30 minutes of repetitive light rubbing of my back I was starting to feel rather bored.  At one point I heard the sound of a man's voice quite close; Carolyne giggled and said that it was her "noisy neighbours", but the sound was definitely coming from inside the house.  Was this a husband or boyfriend lurking in the vicinity?  It was somewhat disconcerting, and did not improve the mood.

After I turned over the massage continued in much the same way, with no brushing of my penis or any similar attempt to make the experience more sensual.  Boring, boring, boring. On the other hand, she was quite chatty, telling me a bit about her life, which went a fair way to offset the so-so nature of the massage itself.  She is a rather delightful person, with a shy but bright manner that is quite endearing.

The hour was coming to an end, and she finally began massaging my penis, which she had not touched until now.  The penis massage was pleasurable enough but rather mechanical, nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, I was left with the distinct impression that she was a bit of a novice in this area, with not much experience in handling a penis. Physically that was a minus, but psychologically a distinct plus, since I always prefer to have my penis massaged by a demure amateur than by a hardened professional.

At the end something strange happened.  When I began to ejaculate, Carolyne exclaimed loudly "Is that it?"  I was left somewhat disconcerted, wondering what to make of her outburst.  Was she expressing surprise?  Or was it disappointment?  On the one hand, that was the sort of surprised exclamation made by a young inexperienced girl the very first time she saw a man ejaculating.  But that surely could not be the case with Carolyne, who was a mature woman who despite her demure manner must be reasonably experienced.

The alternative was that she was expressing disappointment with the rather unimpressive dribbling produced by my aging prostate and weak bulbo-cavernosus muscle, which of course was something pf a blow to my sensitive ego.  I suppose I have to bite the bullet and accept that this is the most likely explanation for her outburst, that she was totally underwhelmed by the lack of the powerful spurts that she was no doubt looking forward to.  That interpretation seems to be supported by the previous reviews of Carolyne, which have referred to her delight in the impressive ejaculations produced by men who apparently are a match for the Egyptians described in Ezekiel 23:20 (New English Translation).

If it was disappointment, it was shortlived.  She took me into the shower and remained there while I washed, which was a nice intimate touch.  During this time we continued our conversation, about her life and mine.  Finally I dressed, and it was time to leave.  She came to the door to bid me a fond farewell; she leaned forward as if to give me a kiss, but then abruptly drew back.  Was it some vibe I gave off that caused her to do that?  I said goodbye and headed out into the darkness of the winter night.

The next day I texted her saying how much I had enjoyed the massage; that text now appears in her Locanto ad as the comment from M, except that she has replaced my original word "orgasm" with the less explicit "feeling".

Initially I thought that I would not return.  Although Carolyne is precisely the sort of woman form whom I most like to receive a penis massage, ie an attractive, mature, rather demure woman, the opposite of the hardboiled sex worker, I nevertheless thought her price too high for what she offered.  $150 per hour for a clothed massage with HE is really too much, given that nude HE for that amount is readily available, and taking into consideration that Rosemeadow on the outskirts of Sydney is not exactly a high-rent area.

However, after reading the reviews on this thread which confirm that she does perform a nude massage and does allow a certain amount of touching, albeit at the rather steep price of $200, I think I might give her one more go when I am again making the trek to Sydney.  I must admit that I find the image of the two of us standing naked facing each other, with her massaging my penis while I gently tweak her nipples, rathe enticing.

Her locanto ad has been deleted or expired, so I presume she is no longer operating, at least temporarily.  Her main activity is as an esoteric fortune-teller, and I suspect she went into the massage business only temporarily to earn a bit of extra cash.  Although she is a very nice person, I thought she was over-priced for the service she offered.

I actually began posting on this site at the beginning of this year, so I think four complying reviews is in five months is reasonable.  In addition, one complying review I did, of Katy at Chinese Point Massage in Canberra, seems to have been removed since it does not appear on my profile; I know it was initially posted since I received a private message referring to it.  Apart from complying reviews, I have posted information on other ladies that I have seen at various times.

Before I began posting on this site, I had been seeing massage ladies fairly regularly (on average about 10 per year) from the 1990s onward, so I think I have a fairly good grasp of prices and services.  As I am now 70, I do not feel the urge to go for a massage very often, and when I do go it is usually for nostalgic reasons.

The review has not been removed. You posted it in the Massage Parlour section of the main Forum when you were a Paid Silver member.

Person's Name: Julie (it changed from the first time I rang)

Establishment : Private in Casey Canberra

Date of Visit: 18 March 2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 0426 287 082

Hours of Business: Day time

Rates: 1/2hr = $70, 3/4hr = $90, 1hr = $110 (oral + $30)

Age: Late 30s

Size/shape: Slim, good body for age

Nationality or Ethnicity: Australian

Services Provided: Massage with optional oral relief

Value for money/recommend?: Good value but a bit talkative

My experience/comments: The massage was good but she wanted to talk about everyday things which was a bit strange.  Alright as an introduction but then having someone give you an exotic massage while talking about the GFC in not right.  I probably wouldnt go back but I wouldnt discourange others from trying her services.  It was a bit far out from the city as well.

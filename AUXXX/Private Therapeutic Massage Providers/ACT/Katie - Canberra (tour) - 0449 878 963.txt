My experience/comments : Saw Katie's 'Aussie bombshell!' ad and decided to TOFTT in the absence of any reviews.  In short, an overpriced mediocre experience.

Katie was at a Northbourne Avenue hotel and I had no problem finding the place.  She is a nice enough woman and quite attractive, if not exactly as advertised (ad said 28 but she looked closer to 38), and we made the usual small talk as she began the session.  It soon became clear to me though this was going to be a disappointing massage (her ad said 'erotic body rub' so maybe a massage was optimistic), being neither firm and therapeutic nor particularly sensual.  She spent a long time on the legs and back without really seeming to put in too much effort.  The bodyslide was unsatisfactory since she was using moisturiser or cream rather than oil, so her boobs dragged rather than slid over my skin. Katie did leave her long hair down and I enjoyed having it fall across my back and shoulders.

Over halfway through the hour, she began the tackle tickle and this wasn't too bad, but again fell a bit short as she just fiddled with my ball sack and made no move to get Little Richard aroused directly.  After the flip, she rubbed the cream into my chest and made a pass or two over my groin, before another average bodyslide.  Her breasts are small and soft and I played with and kissed them for a bit.  She got into a 69 and I felt up her pussy, the lips open and hanging low, while she worked on Little Richard.  It was obvious she wanted to get me to cum ASAP but I wasn't quite ready for that.

I eventually got her to kneel between my legs and jerk me off as she looked down at me in a pretty sexy way.  That was that.  It wasn't the worst punt but I left feeling I'd paid about a hundred too much for what was provided: a weak massage/rub and an ordinary sensual experience.  I wouldn't try her again.  Maybe I'll stick to the quality sure things for a while.

There seems to be a distinct lack of good RnT ML's in the nation's capital... or is someone able to prove me wrong?

I think that's pretty much the consensus, snapper, very sparse not to mention quite dear by Sydney standards at least.  Which means some of us are more prone to take a punt on touring MLs or fly-by-nighters, not always with any success, with the odd exception (e.g. Chilli).

Vader,

Agree completely with you. I just wish that Nicole (one of the WL's I frequented) comes back into town (hope she hasn't been deported). I wrote a review on her the last time I saw her. Definitely bucks the trend concerning the usual WL garbage the ACT sometimes gets...

She's trying her luck in Wollongong today. Obviously you boys in Canberra aren't keeping her busy ðŸ˜‰

Services Provided : massage, oral and full service 

Value for money/recommend? : yes

My experience/comments : 

Thought I would try someone new, found the ad in CT. gave her a call and organised a time to attend. 
She works out of her house, she was friendly and very chatty. She is attractive for her age and keeps in very good shape too. 
I'm not a fan of the Asian massages so was a relief to find her. I am a regular at Belco massage clinic and although aabi is more expensive she is probably better looking and you get oral on top. 

Massage was good, she talks a lot so if you don't like that then might not be for you. She did smell of smoke which was a turn off but got over it quick. 
Massage went for 30 mins then got a bonus of about 15 minutes when she started to tug me, she then put on a Condom and gave me a good head job until I came about 5 mins later. 

Overall good service would go back in the future.

So you got 50mins total for $100 (with BJ)? That doesn't sound too bad!  Do you know her hourly massage rate, aj? Apart from the smoke stink, is her place clean enough?

I've seen the CT ad for yonks but her hours (daytime on weekdays only) and location unfortunately are inconvenient for me. Might make an effort to check her out now that I know she isn't a dud.

Yeah about that. I wasn't paying full attention to the time but it was unrushed I was expecting her to say times up hurry up which I hate and is a turn off. But she was a trooper just did what she had to do. We were very chatty so maybe that had something to do with it? 

I think it was $150 for the hour but don't quote me on that as it was never my intention to stay that long. 

The smoke was only when I first walked in it hit me but it went away quick. Overall place was clean and tidy I didn't think it was messy at all. 

Yeah it just worked out I was in the area and I would see her again

Person's Name : Aabi

Establishment : private 

Date of Visit : May 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0401246175 | CT ad

Hours of Business : Mon-Fri

Rates : $160/hr

Age : 40s

Size/shape : lean, athletic, size 8-10

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian

Services Provided : RnT, CBJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, not really my type but good service and attitude 

My experience/comments : I had a rare window on a weekday afternoon to see Aabi so grabbed the opportunity to make a booking. She works from home, which is bang in capital suburbia, so maintaining a low profile may be a concern for some. I didn't encounter any of her immediate neighbours, though passed a few locals as I sauntered across a small park, having decided not to pull up in her driveway.

Aabi was not quite as I'd pictured her. Her hair was not only blonde when I saw her, it was also pink -- not my favourite look.  However, she was very friendly and welcoming and it was easy to dismiss that minor issue.  She was dressed in gym clothes, and not quite the sexy outfits Suzie in Macgregor likes to tease us in.  Still, I was there for a massage with a modest extra, not FS (which she also offers), so I wasn't fussed.  The table was set up in her lounge, which prudently had the curtains drawn.

We chatted while I stripped and Aabi asked me what sort of massage I was after, advising she is a qualified therapist so can do a proper sports type if that's what was required. I was quite happy with a relaxing sensual massage and she got started on it without any of the dilly-dallying that typically precedes one by Suzie (I mean that in an endearing way). During the massage, which was quite good but I have to admit my preference would be Suzie's long flowing strokes in this respect, we discussed a range of subjects and it was no different to what you might expect with a strictly therapeutic provider -- none of the new age stuff that Suzie is into though. 

Unfortunately, there was barely any contact with my tackle during the massage, let alone any proper tackle tickle to warm me up. After the flip, Aabi went for it more directly. I prefer a prolonged build-up usually so Little Richard took a bit of prompting to awaken fully.  Once he was up, Aabi put a raincoat on him and began a pretty good BJ. Now this is where Aabi left Suzie for dead... mainly because the latter doesn't suck me off so I have nothing to compare it to. (I do live in hope though...!)  Aabi's approach to the job at hand was not particularly sensual or erotic, but was very methodical and effective. She didn't rush me and her technique was ultimately successful.

After a quick clean-up, I dressed and bade Aabi farewell, with just over an hour gone.  All in all, although she wasn't quite my type and the experience was not as good as I'd hoped, I had no regrets and could even see myself returning occasionally for something different if her hours and location were more convenient. Certainly her personality and positive attitude made it a very pleasant way to spend the afternoon. However, I don't expect I will make a special effort to return.

I found her attractive enough for the booking, but not really my type for FS. This is based on my personal preferences only, not a reflection on her.

Her bottom felt quite firm -- sorry, I left that bit out.

Read #3 for one assessment. The best thing would be to make a visit and judge for yourself as perceptions of looks etc vary between individuals.

Aabi still advertises from time to time in the Canberra Times.

My visits to her were too long ago for a full review here (her services may have changed) but in the two times I visited I found it odd that she would strip from the waist down but wouldn't take her top off. I was free to play with the girls as long as it was all under the jumper she was wearing. 

Overall though, at the time, I was happy enough to visit twice. One word of warning, though... if she hasn't advertised the day of your call, she might just give you a hard time for responding to an old advertisement (I got grief for calling re an ad that was 2 days old)

YMMV but I did have a delightful time with this talented woman.

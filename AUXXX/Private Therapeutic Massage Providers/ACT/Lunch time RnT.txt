(American) Sarah, now Natasha apparently, is based within a relatively easy walking distance in Turner (well, she was anyway, haven't seen her as 'Natasha' so she may have relocated with the name change). See thread under ACT PMLs.

I would consider that as a blessing in disguise. Easy opportunity to get a quick promotion to keep my mouth shut about punting activities of a SES

Sounds like potential for unlimited intel for North Sydney! We expect nothing less than a comprehensive review of every WL and ML within 2km north of the coathanger... by the end of January please...! Love this 'retirement' gag...

It crossed my mind briefly to TOFTT early this year but I'm not brave enough to duck in with the lunchtime foot traffic right outside and find out!  Way too exposed for my liking.  I'd be surprised though if there's any systemic funny business going down, but you never know.

There's one in civic with a discreet rear entrance, haven't seen the front of the shop, but there are signs in the loading zone behind blades meswear on bunda st, just enter the laneway, and the massage shop is on the backwall straight ahead and slightly to the left, the sign/door may be obscured by trucks or utes in there, but you'll see a white sign with red writing

Not sure if this thread is good to also talk about your seemingly 'normal' thai massage or even non thai massage places that people know do RnT. Not sure if that is even allowed as they are meant to be non sexual establishments but would be interested in knowing which ones people have had success at?

Gotcha, bit misleading when the thread is asking about lunchtime rnt rather then a review. It was ok for people to respond to that one so i guess that person had their stripes as when i asked its a throw away question.

Anyway i will just sit back and read to get intel on future punts and just contribute the few times a year i get to.

If anyone would like to hear of places i have had success then happy to share if you pm me, if thats allowed...

Not quite. The forum always likes to encourage new members to avoid bad habits, so your Q's got treated more brusquely in the hope
that you get off to a good start in forum life.

There is no further value I can see in this thread so it's arrivederci.

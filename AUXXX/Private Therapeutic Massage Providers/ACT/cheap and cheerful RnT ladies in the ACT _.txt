 cheap and cheerful RnT ladies in the ACT ?

I would spend every possible cent and every last second available to me if there were Canberra places with the same write ups as,

Willoughby Rd, Crow's Nest
Tiandi
Pink whatever in Pennant Hills

There simply doesn't seem to be a place in Canberra where you can walk in for a massage and negotiate for extras. Put another way, in those famous words,

what this place needs is a 50$ HJ !

There are some local privates that provide a damn fine service. I have enjoyed

Linda (Garran)
Mata (Reid)

and I am sure I will again, but is that it ?

Chrisindy's sounds a fine place but it is difficult for an elderly hypocrite to be seen in Fyshwick. The place has a well earned rep so it's not an option for those that feel they need to keep up appearances. It is also expensive by Sydney RnT standards.

I don't really want a fancy venue & a someone who expects to be paid as they look. Nor do I care about company. I want a friendly pair of titties to stare at while she is down to it.

It would be nice to find a plain or reasonable looking woman, probably getting on a bit, who knows what men want and enjoy providing it. In and out in 20 suits me to down to the ground.

Is that too much to ask ?

My experience/comments : 

This is the same house that "Kim" operates out of - http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f125/k...0-959-a-19763/

I called and made a booking during the day and was told, as Antares mentioned, to park in the garage and come to the back door. This is good - really discreet - but there were some tradies workng next door gawking - I think they must have seen quite a few arrivals and exits throughout the day lol. 

Anyway I came and knocked on the back door and no answer! I knocked 3 more times and no answer. At this stage I am shitting myself thinking I have come to the wrong house so I call the number again - no answer - so I leave. I get around the corner and the phone rings, with a lady telling me "OK I'll call her and get her to open up". I headed back and knocked, this time it opened right away and I came through. 

Was shown through to a double bedroom by Diana. i was offered "shower and toilet", choosing to partake in the latter. She was not much in face department but when she stripped off had a fantastic slim body with some lovely C cups. I chose FS 1/2 hr for $100 - she started off with a great front to front bodyslide and CBJ, then slipped on a condom and went into cowgirl. I didnt last long and had about ten minutes spare - she rounded out the time with a great back massage including B2B. 

Overall a great experience, kind of awkward booking but got over that. Needless to say though I didn't get Antares' open back door lunch treatment!

Interesting ................ Sounds like either Momasan and Papasan have several daughters or, they are renting a room/s to girls  .  Hey Jonny, did the bedroom have a heap of stuffed toys piled up to the left of the bed head?

haha nah I didn't notice any stuffed toys, just a heap of pillows, but there were two bedrooms. maybe Dianna and Kim are the same person, physical description seems to match-I didn't check her name when I actually met her. was Kim wearing black contact lenses?

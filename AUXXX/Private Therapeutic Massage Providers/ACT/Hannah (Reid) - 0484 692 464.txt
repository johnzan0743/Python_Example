My experience/comments : feeling a bit randy on a Friday night I thought I'd take a punt on a cheap cracker ad (see above). Quick back and forth and I find myself face to face with the "Korean" Hannah. Firstly she is definitely Chinese, not Korean (I speak Chinese), and secondly, the photos were fake. 

She wasn't bad looking and seemed friendly enough so I didn't leave. Wish I did though.

"What you want?"
"1/2 hr massage (like I said in my message"
"Suck?"
"I've only got $80"
*in Chinese:*
"He only has $80. What can I do about that. Jeez. Only $80."

She then waited in silence and watched me undress, which is never fun, and put tissues down for me to lay my snake and beans on.

Pretty crap massage followed, all fingers, all digging and no oil. No background music. Plus SHE LEFT THE DOOR OPEN WHILE MUTTERING TO HER ROOMMATE THE ENTIRE TIME (in Chinese). After 5 mins of this torture, she told me to flip over, and started the rub. It wasn't terrible but wasn't great, bit of struggle to gain access to her chest, and I was constantly distracted by her muttering "only $80, jeez, he has so many clothes, why did he wear so many clothes?"

About 5 mins into this, she stopped and said "ok? All done?" I was like "naahhh mate not at all", and on she went. Lots of sighing and staring with a bored look and memories of my first bj got me over the line.

It seems there are a number of cracker ads that mirror this one (I think the hint is the bold font in the ads)  and I think it's all the same story.

Somehow I doubt she offers everything in her ad. It wouldn't surprise me if she doesn't even know what's written in her ad.

Anyway lads, don't want to rant too much. Give this one a miss.

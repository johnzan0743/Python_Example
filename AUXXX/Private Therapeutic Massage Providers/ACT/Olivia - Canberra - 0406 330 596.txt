Canberra Times add: AMAZING erotic Tantra Massage, Blonde Olivia, (no sex). City, until Wed. Website. 0406 330 596.

Olivia visits Canberra a few times each year. Saw her in 2007 and experienced a lesbian double with her and Natasha. That was good a good session and DATY featured on both ladies. Have seen the tantra massage add for a few years and decided to take one for the team 

I rang her on Sunday May 1st and arranged a 1:30 pm 1 hour booking at a cost $200 . After showering I laid down on a bed. Olivia removed her dress and kept her bra and panties on. A tame massage began on my back as a conversation about the Royal wedding began. I had not watched it and Olivia found that quite bizzare. She loved it and had drank champagne with her elderly parents while watching it.The discussion continued about the 1981 Royal wedding and also Grace Kelly and her wedding. I did not find this enthralling. The woman can be a bit airy fairy. 

After the flip Olivia took off her bra and later asked me to remove her panties. Only very limited touching is allowed. The rest of the session consisted of me being stimulated and then asking her to stop just before the point of ejaculation. Then there was a final round of stimulation when Olivia said this time I could ejaculate but I said I would hold back as I thought that was the point of tantra. Olivia respected that. 

With the session over we then began a discussion of what tantra is all about and I inquired about how Sting is supposed to make his love making sessions with Trudie last several hours because he is a proponent of tantric sex. In response Olivia gave me the name of three books that she thought I should read. One is called 'Multi Orgasmic Man' by Mantak Chia. She said I should read this before I had another session with her.

In summary I will  not see her again. The massage is neither amazing nor erotic and I like to do full body touching Her service is way overpriced.
As far as erotic massaging goes there are better options at Chrisindys or you could wait for Ella or Chilli to revisit to Canberra which they do each month.

Olivia has visited Canberra over the years and have seen her twice. Saw her in 2009 & 2010.  The second time I was gearing up to go for a lesbian double with her and Natasha but just ended up with Olivia. 

The first time I was curious at just how erotic the massage was.  After showering I lay on a portable massage table, Olivia put on some relaxing massage music and commenced the massage in her underwear.  I didn't really find the massage very erotic though and then it was time to move to the bed for the grand finale.  Olivia allowed only light touching of her body and no sucking or kissing on any part of her body.  Olivia got into a 69 position with me and gave me a toy to use with strict instructions for external use only!  lol She gave me a bbhj whilst in the 69 position and I just got to slide the slim dildo around "with no penetration".  She seemed more interested in meeting my gf and introducing her to the art of sensual massage from a female.  The more we talked, the more I got the impression Olivia was a lesbian.  To her credit, Olivia had one of the nicest pussy I have ever seen, small and plump and I would have loved to DATY.  Had a shower and left again - thinking the whole service was overpriced.

The second time around I was going to satisfy my urge to have  a two girl massage.  As I had seen Olivia before, I thought I would arrange it with a couple that I was familiar with at least one of the gals.  In the end I thought the price was too high and rather than cancel the whole thing just had another massage with Olivia.  I did meet Natasha briefly in the kitchen of the apartment though and she was quite an exotic looking Eurasian.  Went through the usual routine and left with even a stronger feeling that Olivia would show more passion in her work if I was female and the service was overpriced.

agree with the first review, this lady is indeed a tad airy fairy. talks about rubbish and thinks she is most upperty. would be ok if she was hot, but she isn't, and her service is pretty average. way overpriced.

You jd316  are a real gentleman.

The Royal _expletive-deleted_ wedding ! The conversation you describe is not only anaphrodisiac but anti-erotic; more like what you'd get from your old duck, on that unsurprisingly rare trip back to the ancestral mansion (or dump as the case may be).

How did you manage to choke down the righteous indignation at such nonsense, especially when your paying for a steamy time with a hot lady ?

Which relative of Wendy from Never-never land could she be  ?

Dame shame Jack can't write it up, or as ABC says, that you weren't a girl.

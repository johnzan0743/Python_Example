Ad from "crimes":

KIM attractive, sexy Thai,  sz 7, busty, fantastic body rub, fantasy hot kiss, bikini model. 0423 620 959. Chisholm.

I phoned up and made a 30 min apt, Kim has good English skills.  Located in a private house in Chisholm.  I was instructed to park in the garage and come to the back door.  I arrived, back door was open and the family was cooking lunch  mmmmm this is a bit different.  Looked like parents and Kim the daughter.  Mum and Dad were quite welcoming and all smiles then Kim took me through to a bedroom with double bed.   She asked me to undress and said she would be back soon, no offer of a shower.  Once Kim returned she took her clothes off and gave me a very good firm massage.  This was followed with a very nice slow body slide (nice contrast ) combined with good TT.  After the flip more TT then a very nice CBJ to completion.  Kim used wipes to clean me up and a towel to wipe excess oil off my back.  No sign of a shower.  Kim has a very nice body, couple of tatts and lightly trimmed only at the Y ........ perfect .  She was good to talk to and good value for money in my mind.

Mate,

I give up, I am still confused.  $100 for 30min FS, yet you paid $100 for Massage CBJ and Body slide.  If you wanted to stick it in, is $200 for 30 min?

OK just to clarify:

When I phoned, Kim initially quoted FS prices, speaking quite quickly and from memory half hour was $100.  I was after RnT so I asked re massage and she said $80 half hour.  When I was in the room with her I asked re CBJ and she was happy with additional $20.  So for me today it was $100 half hour massage, body slide and CBJ or,  I could have had FS for the same $.

Thanks for TOFTT Antares,  I like the idea of being able to park in the garage and enter through the back of the house whilst in the burbs,  a bit off putting having to meet the parents first though

I assumed "back door was open and the family was cooking lunch" was a euphemism for anal sex with finger fucking her bald twat. You live and learn.

These thread should be read in conjunction with  http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f125/d...hisholm-19824/ .  Not clear if this is a private situation or a shop covertly operating out of a house.

This is what worries me about punting in the suburbs as an unlicensed brothel secretly operating under a house in the suburbs is seen as illegal. And only recently, there was a raid in 2 other suburbs for falling under that operation. 

Illegal Brothels in Canberra Suburbs Holder, Lyons

That said, thanks for the review but considering you're met with other company who are related and are content in operating with this WL, I don't think I want to risk my dignity in the case that they may be running an illegal brothel and thus don't want to contend with the police or community members around who may know me at hand and my punting habits.

Yes call me paranoid but better to be safe than sorry.

I'm with you 100% Cupcake on this. 
Canberra's a small town. Plus imagine trying to explain why your car was parked in the garage of an illegal brothel, as it was raided. 
I'd rather park around the corner and take my chances, than have the car stuck in the shed!

Yes, I am with you guys Lofty and Cupcake in your concerns, as soon as I read the other review, the alarm bells went off.  I don't think I will be back.

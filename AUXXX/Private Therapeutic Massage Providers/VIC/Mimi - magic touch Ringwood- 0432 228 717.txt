 Mimi - magic touch Ringwood- 0432 228 717
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Mimi

Establishment : Magic Touch

Date of Visit : Feb 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0432 228 717

Hours of Business : 10-8

Rates : 120/30 mins

Age : 30's

Size/shape : 8-10

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : Massage, FS

Value for money/recommend? : Yup

My experience/comments : Saw an ad in the usual spot, and decided to give them a call. A very well spoken asian lady answered the phone, the rates sounded a bit high, but I concluded that it must be an inclusive price that she gave me. I decided to make a booking and check it out. Got there, rang the bell, and  a milfy lady opened up, wearing a very tight figure hugging dress. She led me into the room, closed the door behind us and came up to me, throwing her arms around me, and grinding up to me with a kiss. Good start. I gave her the cash, and thought I'd just see where this goes, so didn't ask any questions, or say anything about rates, service etc. SHe took the money, and left me to strip.

She was back within 2 minutes, gave me a half decent back massage, towards the end started playing around the crack and sack, turned over, qucik leg massage.She stopped, and got off the bed, and said to me - This is special massage, then started to take her gear off. Now I must say, body wise, she looks better with the tight little dress on, she has had a baby, by cesarean, and her surgeon has done an appalling job - she should sue that mutha fucka.

Nevertheless, she has am attractive face, and a great personality. She gave a good BJ to start with, good suction and depth, and a lovely tongue movement. After this she mounted me in CG, moved onto doggie from there, before we finished in mish. She has a tight kitty, which did surprise me, and it seems like she genuinely enjoys this. 
I was offered a shower at the end, and I was out of there - to return another day of course.

So far, I've found the girls here to all be a in the late 20's and up age range, no sub 25 girls so far, but all good at servicing, and very friendly, and they all happen to be tight where it counts.

The mamasan here is quite a hot milf too, I've seen her before, just can't put my finger on where exactly, but I'm sure I've had service from her. She says she doesn't do room service here, only reception.

As usual, if you decide to take a punt here- Don't Fuck It Up. Shut up about the site and the reviews, and if you don;t get the same service as the next guy, suck it up and move on, don't tell the girl that you read that someone else got a bj or fs etc.

Have fun boys

One more thing. This joint is in a really good location- nice and discrete, easy to come and go without being noticed, it's very easy to work out if it is being watched, but with the wrong attitudes and behaviour, it's also very easy to bring the activities to the attention of the neighbours.

Where is the ad link? Which "usual spot"?  There are a million usual spots.
Address?

Don't Fuck It Up. Shut up about the site and the reviews, and if you don;t get the same service as the next guy

If you don't give the full contact details others will fuck it up I guess.

Yes Hotty I can read, and  I have a phone.  But it is pretty normal in this forum to include the hyperlink to the website/Locanto/other places of contact/etc  as most others do rather than referring to "the usual places".  If you give a good review (which you did) then support the lady you have seen by providing good contact and background information as to her contacts. Sounds like you didn't get rid of all your testosterone, with respect.

As this is a Private, the telephone number and suburb allows adequate contact details. I suggest everyone just tone things down and be less abusive to each other.

I sort of agree with you Wotan and of course I respect your comments however what I find always annoying is that if the ad is posted on line then why not share the post.
I have had phone numbers before and the response generally get when calling them blind is "where did you get this number"?. 
I hate replying with "Der I think it was locanto or backpage...one of those anyway. I would rather be more specific as I think it ads credence to the call."

Trythardaussie I understand where you are coming from however the main issue is the privacy of the Private provider as a lot operate out of their own dwellings and rely on initial email or contact via the advertising site. 

Another issue is that links and advertisements lapse (as these have and also the one which you quoted for Snow on 21/7/2014  https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f120/...51/#post143524 #11 ).
If it was originally included in the advert, the phone number allows contact and the suburb/state informs the our members of where the provider is. In the event that the provider did not disclose on the web or newspaper advert then only the suburb/state should be provided.

Of course members can always post the link and the content of the advert at the same time to overcome that issue however I note you did not with your Snow review. If the private is silly enough to declare sensitive things in print then they are in the public domain already.

The best response to "where did you get my number" is that a mate who had seen her had told you.

Members who are really interested in seeing the provider can always search the internet for the phone number as a new advertisements may have been added. If none, PM the reviewing member and ask for further details.

I would normally just say, I saw your ad on the internet. Simple really. I'm not specific about the site. If they push it, I have said, "I think it was locanto or cracker, can't really remember" I have never been hung up on, or told to fuck off or anything similar on the phone.

If you don't like the intel, then stop reading the review as soon as you see there is no link posted in the template. You have a phone number, a name, and a suburb, I think with a bit of creativity and initiative - like simply saying you saw the ad online not specifying a site, you can get the rest of the details by calling them. 

Alternatively, like Wotan has pointed out, feel free to PM me, or whoever the reviewer is, but please, do also feel free to be willing to share some intel of your own. 
I've shared info on a little gem with quite a few members on here via PM, playing 20 questions with them, as soon as I asked for something in return, about 90% of them simply stopped replying to me. Not cool. Enjoy the reviews and the intel, stop looking for reason to put the reviewer down, I would understand if I gave no contact info at all, but really, I'd take a phone number over a ad link any day.

Person's Name : Coco

Establishment : Magic Touch Ringwood

Date of Visit :  March 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0432 228 717

Hours of Business : 10-10

Rates : $120/30 mins

Age : 30's

Size/shape : 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean

Services Provided : FS, BJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yeah

My experience/comments : So, got word about a new ML working here. Decided to check it out. Got in, greeted by the mammasan with her nice boobs calling out to me. Into the room, and shortly after in walks Coco. Decided I would stay. Had a quick shower, and then back into the room. Coco cam in, stripped, then  grabbed some wet wipes to give me another clean. I was a bit confused by this, but pretty soon it was cleared up - when she made a big deal about cleaning my ass - she motioned that she will be licking my ass - good start.
On to my belly, and the cat bath started, light tongue strokes, felt good. Eventually she got to the crack, very light rimming, and not really getting in there, but still, rimming I did not expect here. Good BJ, while she was down there. Flipped over, and I must say, from this position, the BJ was not that good at all. Too fucking erratic and fast.

On with the dom, and we fucked in all positions. She does like it deep, and she likes it fast and hard. Fucked for about another 15, before getting her to blow me again. She told me to cum in her mouth, and I obliged.


Good enough session to take the edge off, shower accepted, and I headed out the door.

Sorry - no link to an advert.

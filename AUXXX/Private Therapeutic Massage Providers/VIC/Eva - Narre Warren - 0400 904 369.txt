WIR? Maybe to try for more services or to see her friend Lilly who looks more sexy

Works out of a private house in Skye with another Filippino. She claims to be 35, but looks older than that. I asked for a 30min massage, which includes a HJ for $50. Massage was decent, but not great. Lots of attention to the nut sack whilst I was lying face down with gentle caressing strokes which had me thickened up before it was time to flip over. Asked her if she could remove her bra which she agreed to for an extra $20.
HJ technique was good - not too hard or soft and some ball tickling with the other hand. Managed to get me over the line pretty quickly which was good as I normally take forever to cum. 
Upon leaving, I saw her Filippino friend Lilly who was about the same age, but was more attractive so I might try her next time.

Eva

Early May 2014

Contact-   Locanto- 0400904369

Hours-  11am-7pm

Rates- $65/ 45mins of non massage

Services Provided- Crappiest Masage I've endured

WIR- Fuck No

Experience-

I texted around 9am for the 11am appointment. She was prompt replying and locked me in for 45 mins for $65

On arrival at the house- the door opened and I couldnt see anyone- I heard a voice telling me to come in. As I walked in Eva came from 
behind the door. Now i was fully in the house and she was securing the door. I copped an eyefull of this old battleaxe.
She is a worn out old piece of work with make up thrown on like an arse clown.
If It hadnt been such a long drive- I would have walked but I thought she would atleast give a decent massage.

The room was freezing. She turned on a small column heater and left the room. I thought she could have at least turned it on
when i made the appt 2 hours prior as these things take ages to have any effect.

Im on the table and Eva starts a pathetic application of oil to my back. There is no effort involved just her tracing her fingers around
neither sensual or comforting. Onto the legs and she at least increases pressure and then
uses her nails to scrape my ass cheeks. Any other day and Id be into it but after the shit back rub and cold room
Im not enjoying.

I turn over and shes doing the same rub of oil all over evetywhere but the member. I ask the question because 
I wasted my morning on this troll and I may as well get something out of this. She says she never does that. So ive driven an hour 
and shivered my arse off for this shit massage. I wouldnt mind if she had given me decent massage for money i paid but frankly shes ripped me off.

I hear some high heels walking in the room outside and ask if Lily can finish me off. 
Eva suddenly offers a hj for $30. I never hit a woman but looking at her in the cold light of day she could have been born a he.Either way I am done with this fucker. I think it can tell and it leaves.

In comes Lily. Now she is a nice looking lady.Probably 40
pretty face- I cant make out her body as she is wearing a alping strenght jacket. She apologises as the ducted heating is broken. I suggest she finish me off. She says she has never done that. I say I have had a dissapointing time with Eva and am a bit stressed - she says shes shy but starts to play with her hand on my cock and the other fiddling with my balls. She has long nails with a french manicure and the sight of her pretty hands on me has me to full attention. She asks if she is doing ok and again has never done this so doesnt know what to do.

After a minute she starts a rhythm that is to my liking and she lets me slip a hand into her jacket to cup her arse. Im a bit taken aback when i locate it as it feels like a very large round one. She finishes me off nicely. I say goodbye and give her the $30. Did not sight that fucking oxygen theif on my way out so I left happy

I see the other waste of space Lilly, is still advertising in Skye. They must have parted ways. Both are a waste of time and money.  

As for monsoons, there is a posting on Locanto from someone saying it's a waste of time also.

She has worked in massage parlours previously and knows the ins and outs of it.

Ordinary massage followed by the worst hr, which was hurting me and I had to ask her several times to take it easy. 
She has an easy going personality and that is about it,  light touching of her legs was the only touch allowed.

I'm not sure how she is still going, I've not read one decent review about her, and she is expensive . She advertises heavily on locanto but her prices are too high for what she brings to the table imo

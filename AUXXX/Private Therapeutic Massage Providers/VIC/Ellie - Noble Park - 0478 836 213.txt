My experience/comments : I've been a bit busy in the last month so didn't get a chance to post the review earlier.
I finished work early so checked out the usual site for anything local to where I was working.  I contacted Ellie and she had a free spot for half hour so I booked it and got sent the address.  Arrived to a massage parlour located inside another premises that's on a road with a decent amount of traffic.  After a 5 minute wait I was led into a room and told to undress and hop on the table.  From the look of it, it's only recently been fitted out with still a bit of work to go.  The room was clean though and the towels on the massage table also looked and felt fresh.

To the important bit, Ellie provided a decent massage with a good amount of pressure to work out some sore spots.  She was dressed in a black tank top with skin tight jeans.  The casual brushes hinted that more was on offer.  One thing that was annoying was she still answered the phone whilst massaging.  Unfortunately her next client, a regular had arrived early and he was wanting to start earlier and extend his booking so there wasn't time for any extras though from her brushes and body language, there'd definitely be more on offer next time.  She works with another ML who I have also been to see and will review in another review.  

Unfortunately I haven't been back to see her again but will try to sort that out in the near future.

No its not her in the pic. The "Elle" used to work and was probably the owner of the long dead "Keyspa" in Moorabbin. The other ML has worked in joints around sth eastern suburbs for a long time from Centre rd clayton to urbanspa in bentleigh and few more.

yes HJ and exchange massage is available and regs. get even more .. I  have not seen them for a while but I did drop in a few weeks earlier but they were too busy.

The place is half rented from some mechanic

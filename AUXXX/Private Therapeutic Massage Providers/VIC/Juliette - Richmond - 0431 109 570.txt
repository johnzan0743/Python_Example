My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

After trying a few times to make a booking all the cards finally fell the right way.

Juliette was good on the phone and after seeing her pics I was excited. 

Turned up and I was greeted at the door by Juliette.

No I don't claim to be a doctor but I'm certain she has had or even still does have anorexia. 

She was very skinny and looked very worn. She might even be much younger than she looked. Not what I had hoped for from the pics but I followed through anyhow.

She led me upstairs to a consulting room which was hers.

The massage was just. It was all over very quickly. I was flipped over after about 25 min. She was very quick getting on with the job. She oiled me up and I was massaged and had cum with in 35 min. Now I don't like to continue the massage after blowing so I cut it off there.

No shower so I just wiped myself off with a towel and I was on my way.

Too expensive but I didn't have time to find anyone else that day so I followed through.

Was a quick service. The HJ was ok, bit of bum play but overall I was very disappointed which isn't ideal after a punt. 

I would steer clear guys. Not worth it. 

Oh and as I left she gave me a brochure and business cards to promote her business so I could get cheaper HJ's. They went straight in the bin.

Happy punting

$300 all up seems a bit steep for this service.

Jackyboy...can you confirm you paid $300? You only stayed 35 mins?

I hope Brauninc doesnt read this...he will probably need an ambulance if he does

It would have been cheaper to book a Jetstar flight to Sydney, get a root at 269 Cantebury Rd, grab a lunch and coffee, then fly back.

Yes I did. 

I committed to the appointment and paid up front. 

The massage would have went longer but after I blew I don't enjoy the massage as much so I stopped it there.

If you left early you can't complain about the time lost. $300 is ridiculous for 1hr HJ/nude. The most I have paid was $100 to get a girl naked in a  RnT shop and that was too much! Her Ad says extras up to $400. FS must be on offer for $500+hr. I wouldn't have bothered at that level. She doesn't look like a super model in the photos.

STOP STOP STOP doing this for the fucking sake of us all, it's like feeding a fucking poker machine. STOP STOP STOP paying these fucking crazy amounts of money for any service, when the standard price is less that half quoted, even in Bleak City as the lovely Caroline Wilson calls it.

Crazy isn,t the word .Totally insane .I put a post in gold yesterday 40/half hr massage & she wanted $100 for a works burger .Quick negotiation down to $70.
So $110 for 30mins with a good looking 30 yr old Milf on first meeting .
Shows what happens when there are 9/10 massage shops in one suburb .They are looking for business .
Supply & Demand !!!!!!!

While I agree 110% with you guys about the ridiculous prices being charged  in Melb, we have gone off topic here. This is a review thread for Juliette, so we need to get back to reviews. 
If anyone wants to continue this discussion, feel free to start a new topic in General Discussion, or let me know and I will start one with the relevant replies from this thread included.

My experience/comments :

Found Ashley (not her real name) on Locanto. After some back and forward texting she sent me some photos that were clearly not her, but she insisted they weren't fake. The photo she sent me had the nicest pair of breasts you could ever imgaine, so when I turned up and eventually discovered that she had implants - I wasn't amused    I decided to go for it anyway, she was nice and not bad to look at, about a size 8/10. I chose the bbbj option, her original price was about $150 but ended up agreeing on $100 as a first timer. 
Her technique wasn't great, I kept on having to tell her to slow down, once she did (very briefly sadly) it was actually really good. But her implants was a real turn off for me so she had to work pretty hard to get me over the line, it was with some satisfaction hearing her complain of a sore jaw as I was leaving   

Overall not bad, i have no idea about her massage skills and I'm not sure if i'll return purely because of the implants, it just doesn't do it for me, otherwise I would. But location wise she's great because there's not much decent action out this way

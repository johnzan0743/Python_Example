My experience/comments: Firstly hard to get an appointment, when you do, you have to speak to some bloke, who is quite guarded. So organised a time and off i went 2 days later to a private house. Once there i met Jasmine, who seemed really nice and is a pretty girl, she said let me pleasure you with my sensual massage that will be $75 per hour to relieve all your tensions, pity that is rehearsed.
 ..
She sets you up for a real sweet massage in a room that is really set up. Very quiet girl, that seems to know massage, she gives a really good massage, from head to toes she remained clothed until i mentioned to her that she would look great with her clothes off, but image this, the skimpy dress did not cover much. She stayed dressed unit the Flip, whereby she proceeded to undress and expose a great body in need of touching which she did not allow. She continued with the front massage until it was time for a plums tickle and HJ. Oddly she was rushed for time and then proceed to rush me, which meant the little boys had to get going, that was a let down, but i would really like to know if anyone else has experienced this girl and share with us.

Sorry guys i was to add this in but thought about it for a while and confirmed with a buddy who went there too an important part...stay away unless you are wealthy....she will do the nude and play abit as she says it is a $100, to that point if you do the maths 75 +25 is 100, must have had a blond moment to miss this... she confirms this then you pay at the end, big mistake,.....she says that is 100 on top of the 75, you say what, she says that is what you pay, i have it all on camera.... so be aware there is security cameras every where even in the room, it was not very visible at first.......what a rip off.

The ads on gumtree and locanto are very misleading. Cheaper to go to z brothel. They claim she is only 19 in the ad and they have two obviously different girls in the photos supplied! I sent a text and was told her hours are 7 days a week, 10am to 11pm! Slave labour?

I can confirm that there is a security camera in the massage room, the guy who lives there watches (and records) every session.

There is another review on her in the new members section but it didn't get posted here because the guy got no extras so it didn't qualify as a review.He mentioned that the "pimp" got really aggressive when he questioned the camera.Maybe a discreet phone call to the authorities might be the answer to this germ of a man.

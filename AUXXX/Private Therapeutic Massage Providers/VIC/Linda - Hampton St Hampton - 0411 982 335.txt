My experience/comments : 

TOFTT here.  Popped in late afternoon on the 7th without a booking.  Linda(?) told me the price of $60 for the half hour.  Money sorted, stripped down and on the table.  

Initially, I thought it might work out to be good fun as she spread my legs, but at no time was there even the slightest hint of any extras on offer.  No "accidental" brushing - on the flip a towel was straight over the semi hard on without any comment at all.

The massage itself was OK, but I will not return unless there is clear intel on at least a HJ.  Mores the pity as it is nice from time to time to have a change up from the AMP scene.

Went along as you never quite know with these places.  Started by draping my top half and gave my legs a good massage then moved the towel down and did my top half before the flip.  Overall it was quite a good massage but sadly I don't think there is anything else on the menu at this venue.  I don't think I'll return.

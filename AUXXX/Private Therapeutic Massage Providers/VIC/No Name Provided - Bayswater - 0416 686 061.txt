saw their ad on gumtree and rang the number, a girl answered the phone, I asked about extras 
and was told they dont do it!!

how eve thought I would take the risk and made an appointment yesterday !!
it was an old house. both the girls were good lookin. looks soo dodgy!!
i thou I have hit the jackpot, one of the girls led me to the room and ask me to undress and lay on the bed, 
which I did with pleasure, she came back after couple of minutes and started the massage.
it was actually a proper massage, nothing sensual to it nor accidental touches!! she didn't even go near my crack or anything!!!

any how after the flip, She started the massage with my legs and completely ignored mini me!! like it wasn't even there!!  so couldn't play the waiting game anymore and I asked abt the extras and no was the answer!! bummer!!! after that I tryied  few dfrnt things I've learntin years of punting to check if it's a first time thing, but NO!! 

so it was a bit dissapointing!! but  for $50 half an hour, it was an okay massage!! 
i wouldn't go back, nor whould recommend to anyone!



ps: dnt mind all the mistakes here if there is any cozz did it on the iiPhone! 

cheers

Value for money/recommend?: Yes on both counts!!

Saw Jenny's ad on Gumtree, which didn't really offer too many details, so thought I'd give her a go. Called and made a one hour appointment with little trouble, and was on my way. 

Arrived to find she is close to the intersection of Hammond Rd and Webster St, so there is a lot of passing traffic. Although there are no tell tale signs of anything untoward going on at the premises, so instead of the walk of shame, it just looks as if you are just visiting a friend.

Was greeted by Jenny, and escorted into one of the bedrooms in the house. At a guess she would be late 30's, and quite attractive. She was wearing a short dress which had me thinking/hoping that more than just a massage was on offer. My description of her is a little vague, as I have a shocking habit of not paying too much attention to the look of ladies when first visiting with them. Whether it's nerves, deep seeded shame or maybe a combination of both of them. But the excitement of the unexpected sinks in and hinders the processing & retention of information. 

Jenny leaves me to strip off, so I take it upon myself to decide the jocks can come off. She arrives with me laying on my front awaiting the action. She oils me up and starts her massage, which is not overly firm for the whole, but she does have a nice touch and it was a combination of relaxing and sensual. Not too much crack work, but enough to build the anticipation. Flip over and she oils up the thighs and gives the occasional "incidental" cock brush, which has him growing before too long. I could see that the offer wasn't going to be made so asked the question for a HJ and it was accepted for a $20 fee. Bingo!! She worked the shaft and balls well, while doing it in a relaxing and sexy way. She definitely wasn't trying to rush the job, which was a pleasant change from some others. She allowed touching over her clothes, didn't try to push my luck for anything more. With the combination of her handy work, and the feeling of her arse, it wasn't too long before I was done. Off she popped to get a wet towel, cleaned me up, and I was on my way.

WIR: Yep, for sure! Not only does she offer a great service at a good price, she is attractive to look at, and very friendly and easy to talk to. There maybe more on offer, but don't we always think that after we strike gold on our first visit.

got a booking today for 1 hr. ended up being an old granny who trains Jenny...? (so she said). I was looking forward to jenny... so I left my jocks on. nice lady, good to chat to, but shocking massage... spent literally 1hr on my back, 5 mins on my legs every now and then, no flip... Apparently she is moving in a months time, but Jenny will continue there. place was clean, but the whole house smelt like cigarette smoke... old lady used way too much oil also. walked out with my clothes smelling like smoke... not sure if I'll come back for Jenny or not... she said Jenny is 25 and a student but out at the moment.

That sounds shit Jonah. Did you get the old birds name? Maybe I will just avoid unless I know Jenny is working. 

Even though I am useless at estimating age, there is no way Jenny is 25. I might have gone a little heavy in my review by saying late 30's, but i doubt I got it wrong by over 10 years! But then again I still think I'm 21 in my head, so maybe 20-40 is all the same to me. I'll report back after I make another booking.

Person's Name : Jenny

Establishment : private

Date of Visit : March 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Same

Hours of Business : Variable Mon-Sun

Rates : $60 - $20 for HJ

Age : 36

Size/shape : 12

Nationality or Ethnicity : Caucasian 

Services Provided : Massage- HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 
You're on the money Bob- she's mid to late 30's and a nice curvy 12.
Very pleasant lady- likes to chat and good to have someone you can talk to who enjoys footy, a drink and is down to earth.
Massage isn't therapeutic at all just a rub of oil on your body - no tickle or arse play when you're on your stomach- maybe once she knows you it comes but not on my first visit and as Bob says once flipped - it's up to you to ask for the HJ. $20 and she did a nice job -correct pressure and rhythm so she had me shooting in 5 minutes. 
She still works at Rosebank Ave Clayton on alternate weekends ( as Linda) 
Doesn't appear anything else on offer but just my first time so never say never.
Actually , did run across the older lady and 'never' does come to mind in this case.

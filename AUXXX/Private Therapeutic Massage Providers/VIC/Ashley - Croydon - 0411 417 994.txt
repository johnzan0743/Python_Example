Person's Name : Goes by Ashley


Establishment : private address / townhouse



Date of Visit : late 2018



Contact Details/Address/Weblink : https://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_...RN-SUBURB.html



Phone : 0411417994



Hours of Business : not sure



Rates : 70 + extras



Age : I'd say 40's (not 21)



Size/shape : 6/8 fit 



Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian



Services Provided : Massage and BJ 



Value for money/recommend? : Okay. 



My experience/comments : I saw the ad and it sounded good and the pictures used were to good to be true..  Anyway it was easy to book a time and within the hour I was there out the front and waiting. 
I called and she told me which townhouse number and I walked up to the door hoping that the pictures were on the money.  As you guessed they defiantly weren't her in the pictures used for the ad, but I was like fuck it I'm here now. 

She took me upstairs and she pretty much got her gear off and asked how long.  I went with a 30min massage which was $70 and lay face down on the bed. The massage was okay, after about 20 minutes she asked if I'd like to turn over and if I'd like a BJ. I went with the BJ ($70)  and I asked her to use a condom and she got one, put it on and started sucking.  She wanted to fuck me but I wasn't up for it (not with her). She went hard at it for 15 mins and was having a good old time. She kept sucking my balls and licking all the way down to my arse.  I blew my load and she wanted to keep sucking. 

Hot towel clean up and I was on my way. 

Not going back again.

Yes, this is what these adds on Locanto prey on. Photo's are all BS and even if you text them they lie.
You say she had a 6-8 size fit body so at least she was ok in that department. Was she pretty looking for a 40YO?
Next time I would suggest you walk if you are not happy with what's on offer.
Only this way we can clean up the Locanto act.
Cheers

Have to agree wholeheartedly with Jassy. 
Fact is the script from the ad has been written by someone with a good command of English. Clearly likely a pimp. If it's an older Asian lady. I use the word lady advisedly.

The way to stamp out these fraudsters is to arrange their days so they have many phantom bookings. If you have ever been ripped off then it is in your best interests to expose these time wasters. 
Great resources lead to shutting these guys down.

You request a face pic. If they refuse you know it is a scam. Book them on your burner then block the number.

I'm based around that area, & considering the East is atrocious for price of extras, a girl as hot as in the photos would only work the area if she was going to the tafe nearby - even then she'd be working private (or at least a high end operation) charging Waaay more. 

We all hope to strike it lucky, but 
affordable price + available bookings = 
Fake Photos

Right click on the Locanto photos and select the Search Google for Image option. Scroll down the page that it takes you to to see where else these pics are posted on the web. Easy to tell if they are fake pics...

Person's Name : Ashley

Establishment : private

Date of Visit : 17/2/19

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : https://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_...RN-SUBURB.html

Phone : 0411417994

Hours of Business : unknown, best to message and ask

Rates : 30 mins/ $70, 60 mins/ $150

Age : 35+

Size/shape : Petite with solid C cup tits and a meh ass 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian 

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Not recommended 

My experience/comments : Felt pretty sore after a few rough days at work so I decided to try out a RnT. Had a geeze at locanto to see what was happening in my area and found Ashley. Fired off a few messages and I had a booking set up for later that night. Arrived at the street and texted her to let her know as she wished to direct me to the location. Parked outside and was told to take my shoes off outside the door before I entered. I was then told to open the door and go upstairs, make my way to the last room where a disappointing lady stood in the middle of the room. She wasn't that unacctractive but her ad said she was 24 which was a lie but honestly i was expecting that anyway and you get what you pay for in these circumstances. Sorted out the money ($70 for a 30 minute sesh) and was told to get undressed while she put away the money by the time she came back up i had finshed stripping down and she told me to lie down. What proceeded was a pretty standard massage with long strokes and not too deep, with a bit of oil as well. Overall the massage wasn't very great. Then came the flip and i was offered a CBJ for an extra $50 or $70 for BBBJ i paid the extra $50 unfortunately and she sucked me for about 2 mins then took the dom off and continued with the HJ, she also gave me a few sucks without the dom on so if you are cautious about unprotected sucking i would give her a miss, really would not recommend the extras if that was the standard. I ended up coming in a tissue and then she wiped me up and the whole thing was over. Got dressed and left $120 lighter. 

A note on her ability to speak English, She wasn't too bad and was decent enough to hold a conversation.

Would not recommend for price. You can and will find better for a little more $.

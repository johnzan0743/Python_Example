My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

This lady works from home which is a nice new unit down the peninsula.  Wanted prices above for extras so I politely declined.  She does do a very good firm massage which is a cut above what most try to pass off as a massage these days.  Too expensive for me to try anything else.  I think there is much better value to be found else where.

I've got it. If you check the Victorian Standard Labour Rates Handbook, under Section 5.6 Manual Labour - Massage, Private Providers, it states under subsection ii) Exceptions to Standard Rates:
while the maximum rates apply to all providers, insofar as the provider may term him (or her)self as "Goddess" or "Tantric Queen", then all bets are fuckin' off.

Made the mistake of seeing this woman. 
Took an hour to get the smoke smell out of my nose.
$75 for the massage
$50 for the tug
Neither of which were any good.
She has a shower there you can use. 
Don't be fooled by any pics. She is a bit veluptious and un attractive

Not the same lady I saw.  Definitely not a smoker.

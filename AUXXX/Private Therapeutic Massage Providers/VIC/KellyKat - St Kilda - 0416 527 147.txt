I've seen this ad of Kelly on locanto for quite some time and was wondering if anybody has seen her and if she if worth seeing. 

Any info would be greatly appreciated

Yes many tears ago.

She is Russian, tiny and petite.

Not bad service, not the best. Worth a punt but must be 5 years since I have seen her.

My experience/comments : 

This was my second visit to Nam. First time no extras, but she did promise a happy ending if I visited her again. Who I am to refuse a lady? 


I texted Nam to arrange a time with her and received a very quick reply with her availability for that day. Time agreed on and booked.  Just one thing to be wary of here, she sent me a txt 30 mins before my booking time asking me to confirm. No problem for me but could be a worry if you happen to be with the Gestapo or similar nosy others  at the time.

Arrived a little early luckily enough as I found it almost impossible to get a park near her building. Fluked a spot after 10 mins on Inkerman St and strolled down to her room right on time. She is situated in a small commercial building with a "staff only" carpark, and a green sign on the door that says "Wellness Centre". Climbed a small flight of stairs to a small reception area where Nam was waiting for me. There seemed to be a few other "therapists" at work there, but didnt see any of them and no signage to give a clue as to what they did. 


Nam is a very very attractive Thai girl, black longish hair, very petite and slim and was wearing a black skirt over leggings, with a V neck tee that exposed plenty of tit. Gorgeous face and beaming smile, although a little quiet in nature. She showed me to a small but cosy heated room with massage bed in the middle, a desk and a bookcase were about the only other furnishings. She left me to undress and returned after a few minutes to start the massage. Legs were first, long flowing strokes from ankle to groin, going perilously close to the boys without making contact. Really loved her touch doing this and after a few minutes there were a few decent glances of my crack that had me tingling. At one point she climbed on the table and in traditional Thai style was kneeling on my legs while stretching my body. She then moved to my back , then back for an encore with my legs. Flipped then straight to the legs again, this time some full blooded touches of the boys and one or two of my ever hardening rod. She stood behind me to massage my chest and rubbed her tits in my face as she reached down my body. She asked for $30 extra for HJ which I accepted as she oiled me up and went to work. Very good HJ technique,with plenty of play with the boys, then eventually going to a two handed tug to bring me to completion. No shower on premises but nice clean up with tissues and a warm wet towel. I enquired about, nude, topless, BJ etc but all met with negative response. She was ok with me touching her outside her clothes inc tits and puddy tat.
Have my doubts that anything other than HJ will be on offer in future due to the close presence of the other massage therapists in the building.
All in all a good punt, and definitely will be paying the gorgeous Nam another visit.

Massage 7/10
Tug 8/10
Environment 7/10

Hmm, I had made an appointment with her earlier this week, and the whole day she didn't answer her phone or replied to txt...guess it was a blessing in disguise as I got to meet Sasha @ TM instead. But I'll try to tee up Nam again...

Person's Name : Nam

Establishment : Incall

Date of Visit : 13/5/2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 7 Market St, St Kilda - 0402 613 889 

Hours of Business : 11 Pm till 8 Pm

Rates : $70 for 60 Minutes

Age : late 20's

Size/shape : Size 8, Good Body

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : No

Value for money/recommend? Yes/No

I've been with Nam twice before and after reading her review on this forum though I'd give her another go as I was hoping she would give some extras being a regular. 
I arrived in the afternoon and as usual she has a smile on her face and normally wears V-neck t-shirts with huge display of boobs/bra. 
She didn't ask for money upfront and left the room for me to get changed. I quickly undressed and lay nude with my face facing down on the massage table. The room was a bit too bright for me as she had a tall lamp. Other than that there is a small dark glassed window in one corner of the room which I feel leads to another adjoining room and fear someone is watching the show. Please be aware of this window and let us know if you have any more info as it looked sus.
She has a good massage technique and her massage style is not typical thai but a mix of lomi lomi. She massaged the legs and back well with accidental brushes to the groin area and moves to massaging the chest where she engages some boobs that feel sensuous.
Time to turn around and she covered me with a towel. Bit disappointed and she moves to massage legs etc. and leaves the groin area covered at all times. 
After the massage finishes she cleans up with hot towel. I got talking into her about giving some extras and as usual she denied. She kept shying away when I would insist and ask me to stand up so that she could wipe my back. I touched her boobs which are definitely natural but she wouldn't allow me to get under the bra.

Over all good massage but no extras. 
If anyone has any other experiences with her do advise as she is good looking and has good massage skills but would do anything extra

why would she say she doesn't do extras if the first review from "nextlife" says he got HJ? and you have been 3 times now?? doesn't make sense to me.

I've seen her and she didn't to hj but I may be a case of ymmv.

That window is high up on the other room so unless they have a ladder they can't see anything, I checked.

She is beautiful though and gives a good massage

@de_caulfied - I went there for the first time and was too shy to ask for extras. The second time she promised me extras in the next visit. Last time I went there again I got declined.
I think she wants customers but politely wants to decline their requests for extras.

Also the small window is something that is waist high. Check it out next time you are there. The window has dark tints that prevents you from seeing the other side.
Its something new.

forget about the extras then lol. that window sounds very doggey. But she promised you extras? did she remember you from the 1st visit? I guess thats why it can never hurt to ask before you even begin. I mean if you are there just for the massage then it must be pretty damn good?

Thanks for the info but this is why we are here id say!

It sounds like it's worth going simply so that afterwards you can say that you're back from Nam...

Sorry, had to be done.

Seems like Im the only getting any action from Nam. Ive been 3 times and got hand relief twice. First time was a no go but she promised it would be available on the second visit and she was true to her word.

She told me she is terrified of being busted...she's just starting out on her own so its understandable she is cautious. I think I helped my cause by not asking about extras in my texts leading up to making a booking and pretty much acting like a legit customer to begin with. She wont reply to texts asking about extras and sensual services. So treat her gently and be patient...I can guarantee you it will be worth it.

Has anyone noticed the waste paper basket beside her desk? Each time Ive been to her its been overflowing with tissues...if you want to know if she is doing extras just have a sniff...

I was looking for her a while ago too. I think she moved to the outer SE suburbs and was working out of a home or shop there. She also had a facebook page set up but I cant find it now. Her number has since been disconnected...

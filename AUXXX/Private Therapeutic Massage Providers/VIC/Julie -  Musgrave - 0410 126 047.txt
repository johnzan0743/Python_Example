Just made an appointment with an australian girl advertising on gumtree. Seems new on the scene because I've never seen her ad there before, an believe me, I do check.
she was totally booked out for today (so she says). 
If any of you guys have seen her, can you tell me if she's worth the time and money.
she sounds promising on the phone, but I guess they all do.
she quoted 40 for half hr and 60 for the hour, which is pretty standard for a straight massage.
If nobody has any reviews on her then I will get back to all you guys after Friday. 
But I sure would like to know if anyone else here has ha the pleasure..
happy punting fellas.

Hey Donk,

It sounds like there could be more on offer so take an extra pineapple with you. You should also probably take a variety of grapes along with some oranges to be careful not to overfeed the prospect. She is possibly either fugly  fatumous   or an absolute beginner without a clue. I also suspect she might be a little too good to be true. Book well ahead and check out the addy before venturing out to punt. The ad certainly seems encouraging.
Good luck.


Biggus.

This girl is an absolute sham. What a waste of fucking time. Made an appointment by voice mind you. She said she was busy at the time with a client so she would text me address and details. 
That was three days ago. Called and texted since and hasn't responded at all. Guess its another little girl just testing the waters to see if she can hit the small time. 
Guess ill move on. Gotta go see marina the Russian now, that's not so bad. At least I know what I'm gonna get....yummy.

Been away for work so no chance for me to get out and about.  So decided to keep it local for tonight. This lady has now advertised on Gumtree as Julie and after a couple of attempts to contact appears to be playing games again. No point wasting time and energy. So after some advise from Biggus made a time with another well know lady. Let you guys know how it goes.

Its obvious isn't it. Phoning, texting, bullshitting!

Person's Name : Julie (Laura is now dead RIP)

Establishment : Rented massage room in a legit therapy clinic in Mulgrave

Date of Visit : August 2013 last week on a weekday at noon

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Gumtree Ad same number as heading

Hours of Business : 10.00 to 17.00

Rates :$55 hr

Age : I'm guessing late 30's

Size/shape : about 5'6",medium with a heavy base (would have loved to explore)

Nationality or Ethnicity : Caucasian

Services Provided : Relaxation Massage

Value for money/recommend? : For the price, yes. There were no extras, I asked and was told clearly and politely but the massage was good.

My experience/comments : After heaven knows how many messages, I finally got a response. Apparently, the delay was because she was still in the process of finding a good place hence the on-off... Anyways, I asked how much cash I should get and the response was very specific - no hesitation so that was one wicket down. Anyways, asked for the address, did a quick google search and turns out to be a legit therapy place in Mulgrave so cross checked and she said she rents a room there then traced that to gumtree and voila, the clinic did advertise to rent out a room recently so put 2+2 together.
Anyway, get there at noon and she was there. Not bad looking but nothing great either. She was wearing jeans which was a first for me so second wicket goes down. I get to the room and it was warm, scented and some sort of Indian chant playing over and over again. Lights were low and I saw a tissue box right there. Just right there in front of me (There goes the cover drive) so I'm now interested. She lets me undress (not much talk at this stage) and retuns back. The massage table is very comfortable. You can actually have a good rest there. She starts from my left leg almost from my toes and works herself up. Didn't cover me at all (another cover drive). Fairly good medium massage with some slight nail drag (not sure if this was accidental or intentional) but its one of those things that gets the antenna up. On the one hand, I was trying to relax on the other these signals were driving me nuts. 
She started on the left leg, then did the right leg then the back and then she moved up to my head and ground her jeans into my hands. Damn those jeans were rough and thick. When I loosened up my hands, she moved to the side crap!. Anyway, a good massage and then she asks me to turn over and puts a rolled up towel under my head. I can see her now and she's not bad looking but not the sexy kind that would release the rocket. I had half a hard on. I was looking at her, she was looking at my hard on while massaging my chest and stomach but nothing.
With 10 mins to go, I asked the question if there was any extras and she said no without thinking. I said sorry, I had to ask and she says no harm in asking. If you don't ask, you never know.
My verdict: It's good just for the massage no doubt but I left with the nagging feeling that there definitely is more but perhaps familiarity and a quiet time might be the key.
WIR - I think so. I need to clear my doubts 

P.S. I would be interested in someone else's review and opinion.

Congratulations on your persistence Prolific indeed! It would appear she has adjusted her prices. If she is starving a pineapple would probably be seen as tempting. Indeed!

Love the cricketing parlance  and try as you might to get those googlies down the wicket she has hit you for six not sex and its over the fence and out!!!

More to be had here for sure. Agree with nextlife old snuggles knows the score she is certainly running away from someone or something as indicated by the name change. Perhaps her bosses at Telstra? 

And yes why would someone change their name unless they were a punter or a wl being a little nordy!

Post Content: 
Just giving this punt a little more thought I am certain the run around and caution this lady gives is probably a symptom of something that has happened to her in the past.

The laws and regulations in Victoria suggest that she probably won't be keen to be doing any extras in the massage room attached to a legitimate setup.

The fact that she has a tissue box is a good indication that it is on. But probably only to her regulars. the fact that she has a tissue box in the open suggests that the tug is on.

Now what happens is she probably has some regulars as she is subletting or renting a room from another business she needs to earn the finance to pay that overhead and possibly has regulars from her previous place of employment or if she was working from home her disposition probably has changed. (Read partner pissed off with the constant guys coming (literally) and going from the residence.) This theory could be checked out by a punter. 

Now as for the approach never ask if they do extras. This is the way to get shutdown quickly. Especially if they are used to understanding the colloquial meaning of that phrase.
If someone thinks they will get past first base by asking an overt question like that they will mostly be disappointed. 

The best approach is to be aware of special things such as the awareness of where she is looking. The prospect of having your five fingers of friendship extended were pretty good until you asked the question.

What I do is ensure I have an erection upon the vicinity of the massaging hands when they are massaging the stomach or upper legs. and then after the therapist notices the raging hard on you ask the question by pointing to your erection and saying can you do him or something similar. Sometimes they will say "No I don't do that!" and then you can start pleading begging or suggest to them you are happy to pay more. As soon as they hesitate or say oh alright or how much more the  bargaining is over and you just have to pay whatever they deem reasonable and of course be mindful that you don't pay any more than around 25% to 35% as a tip on top. So to speak! This of course applies to the hour massage. i.e. a $70 to $80 massage is okay to pay $20 or $30 but if you pay more once you build a rod for your own back and perhaps other punters. The thing to remember is the minimum amount without being mean should suffice. The sliding scale approach is the best. That or the I've only got $20 and busfare works most times. just make sure you park the Beemer around the corner! 

Now if you can ask and receive without having to pay extra that is a great thing. 

It happens to some of us a lot but just be aware not to abuse the situation. 


Now Mods perhaps the title of this thread should be changed to reflect the lady's latest Nome de plume!

Sounds like good advice to me, especially the "Can you do something about this swelling ?" bit.

Thanks for pointing out that the name Laura has been laid to rest.

On the money Jada further back on this thread is the report on this lady so guys pay attention. I know I sure am now!


You can thank the effervescent Pacific Brown for the review and Jadaya for the find. Posts should remain separate due to different locale and mob numbers.  Good job fellas. that is what this forum is about! 

Person's Name : Jenny

 Establishment : private

 Date of Visit : March 2013

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Same

 Hours of Business : Variable Mon-Sun

 Rates : $60 - $20 for HJ

 Age : 36

 Size/shape : 12

 Nationality or Ethnicity : Caucasian 

 Services Provided : Massage- HJ

 Value for money/recommend? : Yes

 My experience/comments : 
 You're on the money Bob- she's mid to late 30's and a nice curvy 12.
 Very pleasant lady- likes to chat and good to have someone you can talk to who enjoys footy, a drink and is down to earth.
 Massage isn't therapeutic at all just a rub of oil on your body - no tickle or arse play when you're on your stomach- maybe once she knows you it comes but not on my first visit and as Bob says once flipped - it's up to you to ask for the HJ. $20 and she did a nice job -correct pressure and rhythm so she had me shooting in 5 minutes. 
 She still works at Rosebank Ave Clayton on alternate weekends ( as Linda) 
 Doesn't appear anything else on offer but just my first time so never say never.
 Actually , did run across the older lady and 'never' does come to mind in this case. 


So it would appear that the summation was almost spot on. Donk will be kicking himself. Never mind fellas its on from now on just got to line her up and have the cash ready!

My experience/comments : Nice enough lady , texted a few times the days before I visited - got texts back saying she was booked out for he day .
The day I visited said she was very quiet - so who knows . Located in a room in a Chiro clinic - which was different .
Massage was so so - more of a body rub , told me to undress and was not covered so expecting something . A little bit of sack brushing - but that was it . Forgettable massage so I did not bother to ask for extras .
She has definitely been around - said she has worked at massage shops around the area for 7 years and decided to go out on her own now .

Her actual massage skills are clearly lacking though which is annoying when you are after a genuine massage.

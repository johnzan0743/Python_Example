I noticed an ad in Gumtree about 4 weeks back which said "sensual  relaxation from Aussie Girl" but had no phone number. I sent her an  inquiry from Gumtree.

After 4 days Jess replied and provided her number. $70 massage and she sort of confirmed that there are extras available.

She  works from a very run down house near box hill hospital and parking is a  nightmare. Took me 20 minutes to find parking so if you go to see her  please keep this in mind.

Jess opened the door. 1st  impressions plain looking aussie girl. Into one of the rooms which has a  sort of broken portable massage table. It was shaking quite a lot when I  climbed up and during massage twice she had to relatch the locks as it  started to fold while i was on it...

Massage was  nothing special. Average technique and the oil she used was very sticky...

The offered nude exchange massage for $50  and I agreed to it. She stripped off to show off a ok body ... c cup  tits which sagged a bit (she did say she has 2 kids) and a size 12 body.  Gave her a bit of massage. One thing which annoyed me was her prickly  legs. One of my fav things is to run my hands on smooth silken sexy legs  and her legs needed shave ..... prickly legs are a big turn off for me.

Asked  her to turn over. Didnt mind me  playing and sucking her tits.

Got back on the wobbly  table and she brought me to an orgasm with expert HJ - good technique  and control and enhanced by the fact i asked her to bend down toward my  face and i sucked and kisses her tits while she jacked me off.

Overall paid $70 plus 20 for HJ and 50 for exchange so not cheap. She has a friend who also works with her ,,,, planning to try her soon.

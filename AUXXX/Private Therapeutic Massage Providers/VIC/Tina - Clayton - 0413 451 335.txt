Guys I'm not really sure what to say about this one, thought I'd write a review for anybody curious so they can save their hard earned coin.

I found this ad  on Gumtree (also on the L but can't find it at the moment) after looking for a massage place near me. It was kinda close by so thought I would give it a go. Being fairly new to RnT's at the time curiosity got the better of me and I thought I would try one from a private residence.

Wasn't expecting too much even thought it might be an actual spiritual massage. So called her up, she sounded ok on the phone, talked a little about what happens in the session and booked in a time. After the phone call I was certain it was just all legit.

Time for the appointment, she texts me a few hours early the address and to park in the driveway. So I turn up, pull into the driveway and ring the doorbell. Tina opens the door she's about late 30's, average looking with a some stomach. We say hello and leads me into the room.

Told me to take off all my clothes. We started kneeling facing each other and talked about chakras and all that bullshit. Then we start the "massage" if you would even call it that. Half of it I was kneeling up and she'd do all this "spiritual" stuff (walking around channeling stuff, occasionally touching my "chakra points" . And when I did lay down she did some sort of body rub but girls on their first day would do a WAY better job, it also felt like she used half a bottle of oil (fun to get off later ). Also nearly forgot but the whole time there was this whack ass music playing!

There were no accidental touches or came anyway near close, I didn't mind though I was so weirded out by the experience I just wanted to get out of there. So we finish up, I have a shower to get off all the oil. As I was leaving she mentions something about her being naked next time because she can channel better with body contact and she'll also do it cheap for me. I might write that another review for that if you guys want, this one's getting a bit long.

In my opinion she was a bit cuckoo her head was waaaayy up in the clouds. The whole time she just talked about spiritual animals, interstellar, dimensional bull shit. I tried to have a normal conversation with her about everyday stuff but it didn't happen. She definitely believes everything she's saying and I even asked her where she learnt all this. She told me she was all self taught and just went with the flow, so don't expect a lomi lomi massage or anything.

So if anyone out there who saw this ad and was curious , save your money. I learnt the hard way so you don't have to

I once booked her and had to terminate the session because she was getting quite wierd. There was also someone else in the house, so privacy was not guaranteed. Thanks for the review.

Here's the story of my second encounter with Tina. First I want to say I'm not proud of myself  and I'm hoping you guys learn from my mistakes.

So about 2 weeks after seeing this crazy lady I thought I would go back and see what this B2B was all about. After alot of deliberation (trying to tell myself I would be insane to contact her again) I text Tina for another appointment and we arrange a time for that week.

Same as last time, pull up in her drive, ring the bell. Say hello and leads me back into the room, hand over money and clothes off. This time she gets naked too but leaves on a g string. Honestly trying not to be offensive guys, seeing her naked turned me off completely. You wouldn't call her fat but you wouldn't call her curvy either, she had a big stomach/beer gut and small tits, flat ass and no curves. Not being rude, I was curious on seeing what was under her clothes and just giving the guys out there who are in the same position a warning.

We start kneeling again and go through same stuff as last time. Walking around channeling energy or whatever, touching chakra points. Then we start the "body to body" channeling. Pretty much to sum it up shortly, she pretty much humped me.

She tells me to lay down, usual oil massage with legs. Then gets into cow girl position and starts moving her hips, then reverse cowgirl. She then gets on all fours and leads me to go into doggie. Just to remind you guys, I am completely turned off and can't get it hard at all. I think fuck it, I paid I might as well try. I pull down her g string and spread her ass cheeks, still nothing. I got the impression that if I was hard, something might've happened. Because a few times, she would get me to kneel upright and massage my legs with her head down there.

We finished up, I'm covered in about a litre of oil. She offers a shower but at this point I just want to get out of there. Quickly get out of there and drive off. I still feel alot regret after writing this review 

 Like Anygivensunday mentioned in his earlier comment, she's very weird. And not I'm saying crazy in a harmless way. Being around her, you can tell she's mentally unstable and I was pretty worried about my safety. No matter how curious you are, please be careful

My experience/comments : I was thinking it can't be as bad as he makes out so decided to see for myself.  Arrived on time and was led into a room where I stripped off and waited for her to return.  From here like other reviews it got really weird and very wtf.  She kept talking about out of body experiences and kept asking if I was feeling it.  She admitted the feeling is like you'd feel on ecstasy and even went as far as offering me one for a fee to help get the feeling.  Throughout there was the feeling of someone else in the house with constant heavy footsteps back and forth.  I have to agree with jacky, best to stay away.

My experience/comments :
I wish I had if seen this before I made a monumental error. As mentioned she is so caught up in her web of confusion, she believes her own garbage....So, I made contact and she was quite accommodating. So made and confirmed time and I like have a massage for 2 hours, so she was quite ok with this. I have now learnt that you really should get some clarity as to what is on offer. The innuendo suggests a very sensual and erotic experience.....humbug!!! This lady is an absolute nutcase. As a healthcare professional and for over 20 years , no not in any form of sensuality, be upfront with people who are spending their hard erant gains. Suggestions of all manner of things were made. Well, after instructions on disrobing and laying on a yoga mat, the farcical experience began. 5 mins of energy channelling and spray of a magical mist, oh lord, this is going to be interesting. I then get asked to kneel and cuddling and more spraying of the mist continues. It's to rid my aura of negativity.....This mumbo jumbo continues for an hour or so. Tina then tels me she suffers from back issues. I offer to help as it's what I do, shit gave myself up....
She takes off her tank top and proceeded to thrust her breasts at. But no touching. Just adjust my back....so I oblige. She thanks me and we continue, accidentally brushing of the privates..
Ooh here we go. WRONG...Tina then says she has to see you a few times to get whether your aura is genuine....Well....80 or mins in I get up, wipe myself down, get dressed pay her 250 and walk out.....Harsh....yep. Being new to all this it seems I'm not reading things well....it'll happen.
In all seriousness, my humble suggestion, keep a wide berth....I will in time figure all this out...

I wish I had if seen this before last week.....There is no point to reviewing Tina. I saw her ad on Locanto and made a booking...She believes her on BS....If she does it because she actually believes in what she does I suppose all well and good. If not she is in reality obtain funds under false pretense. On contact she intimates a level of sensuality never seen before. ' I'll blow your mind was well as other things ' she said. What was not mentioned is that you'll need to frequent her a number of times so she is able to get in touch with your aura....Folks we use these services for a reason. There is a level of vulnerability in us all. So to take advantage of this in my humble and possibly misguided opinion is so wrong.
My suggestion..... Caveat Emptor. Be aware and on your guard with her.....Nutcase? I don't believe so. However providing a non genuine service...well that's another matter.

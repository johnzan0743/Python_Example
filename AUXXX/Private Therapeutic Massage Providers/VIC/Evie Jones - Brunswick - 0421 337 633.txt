My experience/comments:

After watching a couple of Evie’s BJ vids on onlyfans and decided I had to experience it first hand.
.
Booking was pretty smooth, she made sure I was aware of the deposit policy on her website, but her messages were friendly enough.
.
Started with the standard shower and she was naked waiting for me when I finished. She has a trim little body at the top with some hips to hold. I like a trimmed (not shaved) pussy.so that suited me ok.
.
Had a friendly chat for few minutes.before she suggested we start the sex stuff. The kissing was very light (but not my thing anyway) and the BJ was as good as I expected﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿. I’d only booked for 30 minutes so was a quick round of her riding me and then some missionary with bbbj/cim finish (my favourite).﻿
.
All in all it was a nice experience and she came across as friendly and easy to talk to. The things that standout, her body was nice and smooth, warm on a cold night, and the Bj was great.﻿
.﻿
WIR - maybe but I feel like I’ve been there done that now and would try other options firs﻿﻿t﻿..﻿﻿﻿﻿

My experience/comments : 

I had to travel to Geelong as I do a lot of work around town there.
Bought the advertiser on the way in and thought I would test my luck out before return back to Melbs around 3pm.

Had a look in the massage section and found the ad "Massage close to CBD, Mary 0413 320 369"

Thought it was worth a shot made a call and she gave me the address and will see you at 3pm. 

After work rocked up to the house and was greeted by an ok looking massage lady and she introduced herself as Mary. Her engrish is not that great but she asked me have I been before and of course I said yeah I have seen you before in garden street that's where I was working . 

Turns out there is another place in garden street an unnamed brothel she said with 2 to 4 girls working there. Interesting I thought will have to find out more. 

Anyways back to the massage started by exchanging the cash handed it over and got naked and layed on the massage table which is set up in the kitchen, yes kitchen which looks straight to her front door. 

She starts with a light massage around the back then straight to the ass crack and gooch. Plays with the balls and ass no real massage at all but kinda fun.

Then I lift my self off a bit and she goes under for the grab and play. 15 mins later tells me to turn around. 

A little rub around the shoulders and neck then sits herself next to me straight for the tug.

She answers the phone while tugging me which is annoying but still got the job done in the end.

All in all not to bad but not a massage more of a splash and dash to be honest. Be careful if you do go as there is a construction site right next door and it's kinda the walk of shAme she told me there is parking at the back next time I come.

WIR: for the price it's cheap if you want to unload and go.

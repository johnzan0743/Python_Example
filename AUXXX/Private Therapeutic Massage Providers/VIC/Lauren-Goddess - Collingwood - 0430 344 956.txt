Arranged via text and was given directions on the day. Parked at Bunnings as instructed, no problems. Buzzed the door and was greeted with hug and taken upstairs. Lauren is very warm and nice to talk to. It's a hippy tantra style practise with all the energy and chakra stuff candles incense etc. 3 rooms and a sauna plus shower. Had the shower and we go into the room. I sit next to her on a chair in a towel and she explains about breathing and being in the moment as she has her hand on my leg. I'm an open minded guy and patient so I don't mind if we lost 7 mins with this intro but that's just me. We get on the table and it's very relaxing her boobs are big for her frame and she does a nice B2B with lots of moaning and tantra breathing exercises this went for a while it was very good but not exactly mind blowing. Eventually she gets me to flip and there's lots of edging with the HJ and all this breathing stuff was still going on it's funny for someone so spiritual and calm the HJ build ups were kinda rough bordering on clumsy lol
eventually she indicates that she is going to 'release' me and I had no choice but to go with it as she is way to hot and good at what she does for me to control it and hold off.  Very satisfying finish and she enjoys watching you enjoy it too! I was kind exhausted after and actually dozed off while she gently ran her fingers up and down my shaking body. I head for the shower and we cat on the way out about her 6month European backpack trip with no plan or itinerary she was about to go on! I think if you were a devoted regular you might get a bit more tailoring of the package and more touching on her. It would be expensive to find out, however.  I actually thought I was getting nude B2B so I was a little bummed. All in all I don't regret it.. I'd say 1hr would be enough.

Lauren usually operates out of Mullumbimby in the Byron Shire of Northern NSW.

She was touring in Victoria when you hooked up. She charges less when competing for work in NSW.

Lovely lass. She has been working for a few years now very experienced and rarely tours.
Def YMMV literally as the further out she tours the higher the rate goes. Very pragmatic gal.

Hey SR, are you sure that’s not a different Lauren? This one’s been in Melbourne for most of 2018 operating out of Collingwood, now she’s in Europe for a few months. And coming back to Melb.

Can definitely confirm 
https://m.locanto.com.au/melbourne/I...-w-Lauren.html

Works and lives just out of Mullumbimby. I have had her number in my Punting phone for a while now. I have seen her in Byron Shire.
 In her Locanto ad she has put touring with limited dates available so that should confirm the facts as they are.

Now the story is a lot of WLs and PMLs have moved north to NSW and SEQ . There are many who move around and are really worthwhile seeing. Mostly the move is North of the Vic border to warmer climes.

I travel all over and first saw Lauren in Northern NSW. Very astute worker and delightful lass.
She is not cheap and clearly likes the Melbourne atmosphere when it comes to earning more money.

Some prefer higher turnover and others quality over quantity. As punters we just want it all for as little as we can bargain for. This only works for certain types of working folk. 
When you read WNN don't try and haggle. They assume you are dumb and just tell you to FO.

Lauren is delightful save for when you haggle. She is lovely but no fool.

 However to answer your question most in the Byron Shire are gypsys of one sort or another and can work and live in translocated places for extended periods of time.
It is however quite clear she is on tour. Hence the above ad composition.

Give her lotsa business and she may turn touring into settlement.

SR.

Apologies for the very delayed response Jason. I have not reviewed Lauren as I was not a member at the time I saw her. It was a few years back when she was in her late 20’s for the second time I think...

I was just reading through the threads and discovered I had not read this on since my last post on it.
It would appear Lauren has emigrated from Northern Neutered Males to Melbored.

It usually happens in reverse but there you go.

She is rather delish but very straight when it comes to what’s on offer and her pricing regime. As suggested before she knows how to press the buttons without lowering her fee. She does a fair bit of travelling and is worthwhile seeing at least once.

If only I had more time. The ones you see mean there are others you must miss out on. Well for that time slot anyway..lol

SR.

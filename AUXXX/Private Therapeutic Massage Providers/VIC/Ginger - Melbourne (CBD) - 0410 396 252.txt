My experience/comments : This... this was like a flashback to the days of the mid-late '90s. Clean place, attractive girl, nice scented candles... they've actually gone in for a bit of effort on the massage side rather than it being a smelly dump. Hoo bloody ray. Thought I was getting YoYo, ended up with Ginger. She's a very attractive girl, bit of haggle led to nude massage for +$50. Again, flashback to the 90s... Ginger can actually give a decent massage, and also knows when to switch it from decent to sensual.

Ginger would also have the softest nipples I have felt in a long time. Quite amazing. No sucking allowed, only gentle touching, but the clean room, the clean towels, the scented candles, a pretty girl, a good HJ, good way to spend my lunch break.

Ginger works Mon, Tue, Thu-Sat.

WIR/can I recommend? Yes.

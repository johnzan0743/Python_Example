 Olivia - Melbourne - 0430 816 177
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Olivia

Establishment : Private studio

Date of Visit : 3/8/12

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0430 816 177, also advertises on locanto

Hours of Business : Unknown, seems to be afternoons

Rates : $110/hr sensual massage

Age : 30s-40s

Size/shape : laaaarge

Nationality or Ethnicity : Claims Indian but I would have guessed Polynesian

Services Provided : Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Difficult to answer -- see below. In short: WIR? No. Others may like it. 

My experience/comments : So, after a lot of messing around, I finally got a chance to meet up with Olivia -- not the most attractive face or body in the world unfortunately. We had agreed on a sensual massage beforehand, and she asked me for hard, medium, or soft. I said, "Well, seeing as it's sensual, how about soft?" The massage I received was to soft as living immediately adjacent to an airport is to peaceful. If that was her soft massage, avoid medium! She also had an odd method of dividing the body in two longitudinally. Did my left side, then an intermission (see next paragraph), then my right side.

Once she'd completed by left side, she then did a lot of exploring of my crevasse, tackle tickle, and some lomi lomi techniques. There was also this unusual (for me anyway) of tapping her fingers on the inside of my thighs as well as my shaft whilst doing the underbody slide. When I looked, it was like a violinist's fingers. It was actually very very nice, and quite sexy. She went for a bit of anal play, which is not my thing, but on the cards for those of you who like it. Made me think less poorly of the remainder of the massage.

Come the flip, and she gave me an OK handjob, but again did not seem to know when to stop, even when I asked.

Definitely fully clothes at all times on her part (I asked)

So, that's the deal. I'll not return, but it might be good for others.

I saw Olivia about a week ago. I would agree with all that cl said. I too asked for soft and she nearly wore a hole in me she pressed so hard, so I don't think she is a great listener. The looks are exactly as described above and to be honest I won't be returning. Just not my type and not my type of massage either.

She will get her gear off for extra cash but I wasn't keen to go there I have to say.

Apologies for the confusion but there is an error resulting in your earlier reviews not showing up in your posting logs, which we are currently looking into.

Apologies again for any inconvenience.

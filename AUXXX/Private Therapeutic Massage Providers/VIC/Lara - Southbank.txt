 Lara - Southbank
				
Post Content: 
Lara advertised a little on locanto as a French / Masseuse. She is about 30 and of African origin from France. She speaks perfect English. She works out of a unit and directs you via locanto contact with my locanto. She gives a very nice oil massage. She is a solid girl who is visiting here and usually works through the afternoon.

I'm loathe to post her number as she doesn't advertise it and prefers email contact via locanto.
70 per hour with a happy ending. She allows touching up top and provides a shower.
She is a rather quiet but nice person.

WIR: yes.

Hi,

Is this Lana, or is it someone different? I've been trying to arrange a hookup with Lana for a couple of weeks now; finding it very hard!

Are you able to describe where roughly in Southbank she is?

Cheers

There's a few ads on Locanto from 'french girls' eg 

( http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_3...-Pleasure.html
http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_2...-masseuse.html
http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_2...-masseuse.html )

but none of them sound like Lara.

Excuses like "She doesn't like reviews", "She doesn't have a phone number", "She ...." for not posting reviews are hard to understand since this is a site for punters and not providers.

To paraphrase the  advice to forwards near the goal, "Review farken!"

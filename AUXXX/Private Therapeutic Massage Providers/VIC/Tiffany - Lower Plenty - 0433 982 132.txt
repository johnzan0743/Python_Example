I saw Tiffany's ad(include pic- look like Aussie age mid 20's pretty) on gumtree few months ago and now has been removed.  I rang her couple of time to make an appointment but she said she only book new client for Monday, other
day for her regulars. Unfortunately, Monday is my busiest day of the week for me, so therefore I would like to share this info with you guys. Some of you could have been her regulars clients?? or just a one off visit?? Any reviews or feedback would be great. cheers

She provides a massage. Lomi Lomi is her best.

She goes under and over the body. 

Price roughly $80 I think

No extras

Tiffany has an ad on Adoos but her mobile is now disconnected and the shop has removed any mention of her from the premises and the website.
I suspect it was due to her publicity from sites that she advertised on annoying her business partner and owner of the biz she worked in.

Acupuncture and chinese medicine clinic - tcm lower plenty melbourne 

The above link is her ad on Adoos. Pity she appears to have gone out of biz before it took off.

Rang and spoke with Daniel her old biz partner yesterday. He said she is practicing elsewhere but did not know where. I asked him for her contact number and he gave me her disconnected mob number. This bloke is clueless. Before I release the bloodhounds in search of this lass can anyone who has had a massage lomi from her inform the thread if the underbody strokes avoid or contact the family guys. Might be worthwhile looking if she is not aversed to a bit of tackle tickle and ballbag brushing.

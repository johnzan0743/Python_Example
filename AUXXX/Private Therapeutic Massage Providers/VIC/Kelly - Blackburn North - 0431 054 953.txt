[COLOR=#333333]i saw her ad 'sensual lomi lomi massage' on gumtree and decided to give it ago, made an  appointment for a sat afternoon. she gave me the address over the phone and she did sound like a nice chick.
when i got there she offered me to have a shower, which i happily accepted! it was a brand new shower they had done inside the shop right next to the massage room, so after the shower i went back to the room and waited for her on the massage table.

then she came back and started the massage, shit load of nice warm oil started flawing top to bottom on my back and she did have a great touch too!! it did feel like a real slow lomi lomi massage. there was times that she rested her big melons on my body while her hands rome all over me!! i was like 'chi ching!!!' i really thought i had hit the jackpot there!!! after about 40mnts into the massage she asked me to turn over. by this time mini me was at full attention!! BUT!!!! for the next 20 mnts she completely IGNORED it!!!  i asked her about extras she said she doesn't do it!! WTF!!!

But it was a great slow sensual massage. so if you are after a sensual massage without the tug, this probably is the place for you!! if you need anything more than the massage, dont bother!!

I found Kelly's massage to be a mediocre lomi. I was fully naked at all times and she had no issue with my cock being erect while she massaged my front. In fact, when I went limp after she said no to my HJ request, she went back to caressing my upper thighs- encouraging another hard on. She's a late 20's larger Aussie girl. Probably size 18. There are 2 other girls in this shop, Flo- @50yo large aussie lady who gives a fantastic Balinese massage for $80/hr - I much preferred Flo's effort. Flo offers a Lomi for $100 too and hers is far superior to Kelly's. There is a third Aussie girl here early 20's and actually slim. $100/hr for her for possibly the lamest attempt at lomi I have had. It was a mind numbingly boring waste of my time and money for a very basic application of oil to my body. Didn't get her name.

I stopped going there after that shit massage from the thin girl. I let them know that she was hopeless and Kelly offered a half hour free on my next visit but I'm not interested in Kelly's massage either.

Gotta agree with all that has been said. Kelly seems to like the idea of arousing her clients, but doesn't want to finish the job. It's like going to the pub and only drinking lemonade.
And Flo does give a cracking lomi, not much to look at, but very sensual massage. Haven't seen her finishing talents yet, but it does seem like they may be available. There are better places to blow $100!

I'd read reviews of Kelly when she was in Blackburn (http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f120/k...4-953-a-16684/) and saw an ad on Gumtree (Lomi Massage Mooroobark Kelly 043105**** | Massages | Gumtree Australia Yarra Ranges - Mooroolbark | 1032990164)
I also put two and two together and realised I'd seen her mum in Croydon a few years ago before she went to Perth (http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f268/c...8-926-a-24479/)

I thought I'd give it a go as I'd enjoyed Connie's massage even though it was a DIY

Kelly is a bit overweight but with a nice face and great personality. She works in a bit of a dive shopping complex in a shop that still has all the signage of the old business (all curtained off). Inside she has portioned of a nice massage cubicle with nice lighting and music.
Made th appointment but had to text when I arrived so she could open the door.

I undressed and waited starkers on the table.She cam in and started the massage, lots of nice warm oil started flawing top to bottom on my back and she did have a great touch too!! it did feel like a real slow lomi lomi massage. there was times that she rested her big melons on my body (still in her clothes) while her hands roam all over me. It was really sensual with some nice "accidental" brushes downstairs. After about 40mnts into the massage she asked me to turn over. More sensual slow massage all over with some slight brushes. I asked about extras but was told no (fully expected that). She said I could DIY - so I did gently and slowly for about 10mins until I couldn't stand it any longer. I was given the tissues to clean up but I missed a bit when she went back to massage and she had to clean me off properly.

Personally I don't mind the DIY if the massage is really sensual - which this one is. Plus i love looking at her boobs while I go at it.

I'll go back again! Kind of hot that I've done a mother and daughter!

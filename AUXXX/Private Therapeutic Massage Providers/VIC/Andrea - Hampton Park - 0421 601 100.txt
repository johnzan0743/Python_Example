Haven't tried but I enquired with her about a double massage.
She said its $60 an hr single and $130 for a double ( I don't 
understand why it's more than twice the single rate)

Here's a link to her Gumtree Ad ID 346714276 : 
**Full Body Rejuvenating Oil Massage** - Melbourne Region health, beauty, fitness - Gumtree Melbourne Region Free Classifieds
It shows her rates & types of massage provided. Seems a legit massage only service.
Interesting though that she thought it important to mention her age. Good marketing.

"Massage Hampton Park

    Massage by a female was advertised on Locanto and I tried my luck, I got to the place at the specified time and was taken to the study room with a massage table. I got undressed and the girl came in and asked what type of massage I wanted, and I opted for the relaxation massage.

    The massage felt like a lady bug was on my back walking up and down, she didn't even go close to my thigh. She was very generous with the amount of oil she was putting on my back. Upon flipping over she didn't bother to grab the towel and it came off, she put the towel back and ran her hand around a few more times and it was all done. I asked for extras but was told no.

    Looks 2.

    Massage skills 1.

    Damage $40.

    If you see the ad, don't bother and waste your time. "






The above was a review of her from a punter about a month ago.

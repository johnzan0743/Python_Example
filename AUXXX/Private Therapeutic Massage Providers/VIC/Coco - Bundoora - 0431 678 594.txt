My experience/comments :

I think 2 girls work here, they used to advertise on Locanto, but a buddy tipped me off on this one because he knew I have a thing for Asian girls with unusually big boobs.I made a call and a response came back about 1hr later -'you want massage'? Coco was free then so I jumped in the car and headed over to Bundoora. a pretty chinese girl met me at the door dressed in a track suit so I couldn't see her body, she led me to a small room setup with a massage table, left so I could get my kit off, and came back to begin quite a firm professional massage. a word of warning - she uses baby oil, if I go again I'll take my own coconut or jojoba oil, it soaks in better, and as there is no shower on offer, the wet towel clean up will get it off easier - later I still felt like I had been swimming in an oil tank. On the flip the universal sign got agreement from me so her trackie top and bra came off and some nice DD naturals got a workout on jnr. I think Spanish is her specialty. while she has been here a year or so conversation didn't exactly flow, but between her boobs and oily hands I was able to shoot my load. Coco cleaned me up with a wet towel which didn't do much to remove the baby oil - no shower was offered. ever the gentle man I thanked her anyway and took my leave. WIR, if I do it will be with my own massage oil and quite possibly a box of baby wipes!

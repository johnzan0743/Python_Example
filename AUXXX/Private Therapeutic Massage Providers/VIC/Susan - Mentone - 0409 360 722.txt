Hours of Business : 9-6 (But not sure)

Rates : $60 hr

Age : 40's

Size/shape : Small size 12

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian

Services Provided : Lomi Lomi - Shiatsu No extras

Value for money/recommend? : Ok for a straight massage

My experience/comments : 

Rang Susan and arranged appt for that afternoon.  She works from her unit in Mentone, with a table setup in the lounge room. No shower facility offered.
I decided on trying a Lomi Lomi, so left me for a couple of minutes while I undressed and got ready. Took everything off and lay face down. On her return she placed a small towel over my ass and between my legs then took my legs and spread them as wide as they would go. At this stage I thought there might be more on offer but alas it didnt turn out that way.
The massage was quite good but she was a bit too chatty for my liking , there was nothing sensual or no "accidental" touches or brushes. Turned over, tackle covered with a towel and finished off the massage.  I asked the question regarding any extra services but was stone walled with  "No, not ever"...

 WIR. Dont think so, but all in all not a bad massage but found her to be a bit strange, or maybe eccentric is a better word for it.

You got it right first time, strange is the word!!! She is, how would you say......fucking nuts!!! 

Went last year, she chewed my ear off with just crap, then sang very badly for me, and I found it very odd that she had a photo of herself under the massage table, right below the hole for your face, so you had to look at it if you had your eyes open. I had to hear about her audition for some lame singing show, and this story went for ages!! I think there are a few screws missing.

To her credit, the massage was good. She seems harmless and friendly enough, but there's definitely something missing there!!

I also have fallen into this trap. She was telling me how she was going to be riding a horse on some tv show or movie or some shit.

Lady was absolutely crazy. I did an hour and was the longest hour of my life

I too have seen this strange girl. She did all the above. Picture on the floor, singing shit and she stood ten feet away from me if I wasn't having a massage. I had to put the money on the kitchen bench and she just stared me down as I was paying her..... Very fucking weird. Never going back..

Prolific things cannot be that bad that you would contemplate visiting a loon! I suggest there are much better ways to have a decent punt along with perhaps seeing a shrink.

Now unsure why after reading the above posts that you would for one moment contemplate seeing this obviously self obsessed karaoke kook but perhaps you should understand that the only thing you have to gain apart from a feeling of insecurity and weirdness is the loss of an hour of your life along with having shed some weight from your wallet. Now if you want to waste your time and money that is what Clubs are for. If you want your todger tossed then research further by reading through the pages of this forum and you will find challenges more befitting your quest along with punts that pay! After all that is what this forum is for. Otherwise you can send me your money and I will punt Prolifically with it possibly purchasing pussy periodically posting postscripts for your perusal perhaps. Or not! This is just this man's HO. 

BTW getting a hard on would be the least of your problems whilst attending this masquerade of a masseuse! 



Biggus.

Biggus, not sure I can explain this but the loony part is what makes me want to experience it. The reviews say massage isn't bad so nothing lost but she seems to be miles different and that is where the curiosity is for me.

Realy! give it a miss Prolific...I've been there...she's very wierd...I could say if i enjoyed the experience and she was wierd, but she is over the top wierd....Give your money to someone else. Check out my new review on Massage pozitiva... she is worth your money without all the wierdness.

I thought if she was harmless perhaps I could experience the weirdness too but from comments above it seems it may not be the case. Perhaps, I'll skip.

A sage and extremely wise decision Pro. There are plenty of great punts out there to be enjoyed without paying money to ones you won't. Read the reviews thoroughly and punt with certainly and both heads and review. Most of all enjoy yourself.

Person's Name : Susan

Establishment : Private residence in Mentone (bayside Melbourne)

Date of Visit : Dec 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0409 360 722 (found in a local paper)

Hours of Business : M-F 10-7 

Rates : $30 half hr

Age : Mid-late 40's

Size/shape : Small....possible size 10-12

Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie

Services Provided : Lomi Lomi massage and that's it....No extras

Value for money/recommend? : If you can handle her singing at the end

My experience/comments : 

Woke up with a bung shoulder and looked in a local paper at a cafe I was in while I was down that way with work for the day.  You walk into her unit and there's a table right there in the lounge room.  She ushered her dog outside and started what was a continuous flow of verbal shite for the entire 30min.  Completely covered the fella to avoid any accidental contact and from there I knew it was a mistake.

Its an ok massage she does (Lomi style) and my shoulder did feel a lot better the next day.  Towards the end of the massage she starts doing this primal type of humming, which moves into singing and then before I knew it I was ready to cover my ears.  Clearly takes herself very seriously and definitely doesn't offer any extras.

WIR?  Nope....not my cup of tea whatsoever.

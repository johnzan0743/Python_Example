My experience/comments:

Had trouble actually booking Ebony from the get go. It finally happened and I went to her apartment in the CBD.

Immediately I mentioned how she lied in her ad about the photos being 100% accurate. She said it was a "safety" isssue. Strike 1. 

She was okay looking but I do have a thing for busty, thick girls so I  stayed, even though it ended up being a waste of time. 

She offered extras but the entire service was a mess, which is why I am writing the review so she can be avoided. 

She gave me a very quick massage on the back of my thighs and calves then went into a dry tug which I ended up stopping. She stopped perhaps twice to answer her phone, once to actually take a call, and pretended like nothing happened.

Note: She mentioned she was doing this for school fees to become a nurse. I didn't buy it.

WIR: We all know the answer to that: Avoid like the plague.

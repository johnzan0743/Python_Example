My experience/comments : Saw one of her ads on Gumtree and wanted to give it a try as the price was really good for 1 hour, I needed a professional massage (without a happy ending) so I booked her for 1 hour. I arrived and she greeted me at the door, very friendly sweet girl. I was asked to strip down and keep my briefs on.

Massage was fantastic and she was very VERY professional except for one moment during the massage she pulled down my briefs all the way without asking me and massaged my bum with a lot of oil. She apologized for getting too much oil on my briefs and asked me to remove them. She apologized again and again to which I responded "It's ok, not a big deal' , these girls worry too much lol

45 mins on and the flip happened, nothing sexual throughout the massage but she did make some contact with my penis here and there as the day was very hot to be under a towel, she said she usually uses draping but allowed me to just lay there naked without any draping. Asked if she would offer me a HJ for extra but she responded that she will never do it to no surprise, her ad clearly states it and she doesn't seem like the girl who will do anything sexual....YET

I took one for the team I guess? If you want a fully therapeutic massage that will make you feel completely relaxed and recharged then go for her , but warning you will have a raging boner at the end and she will NOT take care of it.

My experience/comments : I've visited the usual R'n't's in my area (Wantirna) and too be honest I'm bored and was longing for just a good value massage. I came across Sribrah's post and decided to give it a shot. I told myself $50 for an hour massage is bloody good value and if by any chance there is an offer at the end to have some fun I'll take some extra cash just in case. 

Setting up the appointment was easy and received very prompt polite replies. I arrived at her house and it was super clean. As soon as I walked in she asked me to take my shoes off and she gave me some slippers to wear as I walked to the room. Once in the room she asked me to take everything off apart from my underwear (that's when I knew for sure there would no happy ending at least for this time). She asked if I wanted soft, medium or hard and I went with medium and the massage was perfect! Just the right pressure to get some knots out but still relaxing with nice scented oils.

When she asked me to flip I didn't have a boner but was semi there. She def did touches/grazes of my balls and dick but they were less obvious then you're typical R'N'T place but touches that you would not expect in a professional massage setting. I may be reading into this but I got the idea she was giving me enough to go on implying there may be more on offer if I became a regular. Either way, I will def be a regular because I walked out of there feeling like a million bucks and my wallet was also better off. $50 for an hour is fantastic for what I just got. 

I have already rebooked for $90 min same time next week so will update you all if there is something else on offer

It is amazing what repeat visits and building a rapport can bring. Especially if you feel there was a slight hint.

Good review James, do report back to us what happens next week  I had a similar experience as yours.

I think soon enough she will realize that she can make twice as much as she makes in a day by offering sexual services. But she doesn't seem like the girl you can turn.

Even if she never offers anything sexual it's still incredible value for money, her massage skills are second to none I've ever had before.

My experience/comments :Hi guys.I was looking to have a legitimate massage, so i read old posts  and noticed that there was a thai massage in ringwood east that was legitimate with future possibilities. So i texted the number and made an appointment for mid morning for 1 hour. She no longer does 1/2 hour massages.

Arrived at her unit but couldn't find a parking spot, so i let her know the situation and she told me to park inside the property which i did. I was about to knock on the front door when NOI opened the door and greeted me in thai and let me in. Exchanged pleasantries and led me into her massage room, told me to remove all my clothing but leave my undies on. After a few moments she returned and directed me on the massage table draped me before commencing the massage. 

At no stage during the 1 hour massage was there an inkling that more might be on offer, even though i wished there was. NOI asked me to flip and once again fully draped and removed draping as required. Affter the massage was finished she cleaned me up and asked me to dress. Paid her her fee and left the room. Before i left NOI gave me a cup of thai tea which i drank and a hot hand towel to wipe my hands. She then asked could we do a photo together and would i mind if she put the photo on her facebook page. I said that would not be a problem.

WIR.  yes absolutely. The massage was first class and for only $55.There is no doubt i will book again shortly as she is a very nice and beautiful lady.  I will go with no expectation of receiving a hj but should a miracle happen and future visits result in a hj, that would be a huge bonus.

cheers

Had a look at her Facebook page and she seems to have many good reviews and has high ratings.
Think it would be difficult to turn this one she is probably already making good cash. Also looks like a nice clean setup.
Great smile 
Hope you wore a disguise for the photo shoot 
Cheers

She has a big client base now and I tried to book her couple days ago for a massage and she's fully booked out until Monday 
Not surprising because her massage skills are top notch. I'd rather have a massage from her for $50 than a sloppy massage from an asian RNT with a tug for $50

Hi guys.

So i decided to book again, firstly as i wanted a massage and secondly to see if hj was available.

Basically the massage was like my first one but i felt that she was a little more relaxed this time. Whilst she massaged right to the top of the thigh/leg i cant honestly say it was sexual,pleasurable yes but nothing that i could say would indicate any extras.

We spoke about a different things in life and she informed me that she is now open 7 days a week and she has employed another thai girl who would look after me if she was busy. I was very polite as i am always but was reluctant to ask about a hj in case i offended her. NOI asked me to book 90 minutes next time to which i agreed.

I guess the thing is that her massage skills are first class and i had to tell her to give me a medium massage as the hard one she started with was a little painful. On my next visit i will ask if she does extras and if she says no i will apologise profusely. Once again, NOI is a lovely lady and i will continue  to see her when the need  arises. I just hope that she says yes.

cheers

Won't hurt to ask. I'm sure countless punters have asked her/offered her money for extras already.

Her ads clearly say "STRICTLY NON SEXUAL" for a reason

I wonder if a 90 minute upsell is code for anything?

This experimenting stuff can become expensive.

Try it and report back the outcome to us

I too wanted to ask about extras on my first visit but I didn't want to offend her.
Noi is a very lovely girl . On my first visit she gifted me some grapes and a bottle of water to take home.

Can I first say this was one of the best massages I have had.

But seriously guys, she is a professional. She is married. There are no extras here. A lovely lady who does a great massage with good conversation.

Don't be a pig and hassle her. She is 100% legit.

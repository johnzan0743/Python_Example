I find as soon as the words Tantric are involved, the price is high and all you get is a HJ and soon $250 down the drain.

My experience/comments :
I saw Ella few weeks ago in collingwood at her shop upstairs, she was a very friendly girl over the phone and very pleasant personality and looks in person. she took me in to her room and ask me few questions to get an idea about what I'm after!!  I got undressed had a shower and waited for her n the table. she came back and started the massage naked!! it was more of a reiki sort of massage for the first 15mnts. which is not my think but I patiently waited, then she started the massage and it was very avarage relaxation sort of massage. before the massage started I told her that I'm a big fan of Lomi Lomi massage and she said she will combine bit of lomi to the service, unfortunately there was nothing sensual to the service, I even struggled to get a hard on. after I roll over she started the tug and it wasn't a cock worship as she promised at the beginning!! it was just a typical tug that u would get at a Chinese massage place, and I was only allowed to touch her back(FUCK MY STUPID BRAIN!!) after spending $250 It was a money down the drain!! 

from what I've learnt after that from gem in seaford ally hasn't bn in the industry for long!! if u r not worried about the looks I recon gem is a much better service for that sort of money!! to be honest I haven't really doubt anyone worth that sort of money. I personally think most of the girls in $150 range does a lot better service with a great lomi lomi massage......

I've said it before and I'll say it again, "tantric" is code for utter waste of time and money.

jadaya, thanks for the review - bit up in the air as to see Ally or not.

while  I have experienced "tantra" massages that have been somewhat a waste of money I have also found some rare diamonds that ive had very satisfying sessions with - its just few and far between... 

I cant just condemn all "tantra" to be a rip off... the rare diamonds have been far too good to loose hope.

just what works for me

I know what you mean simple-love,  don't rule her out just because I didn't like her!! but I wouldn't personally recommend her to anyone based on my experience. having said that you might enjoy her service!! as we always say it's very YMMV.

Another good review mate.
I called Gem last week and found her very bubbly and enthusiastic on the phone.
Was thinking of making a visit this week,but is she not a stunner??
Coz ur review depicts looks aren't great????

Hi Guys, 

Locanto advert looked promising, girl was claiming to be slim and attractive. Asked for text photo which I received, again smoking hot Asian girl. Went to cbd Vibe Savoy in Spencer St. Got to her room and guess what? Different girl, 5 out of 10, slightly overweight and frankly I could not be bothered even seeing her nude let alone asking for extras, so I walked out of the room.

I am sick of these fake ads misleading punters that they are beautiful when they are not. If you get mislead, don't stay, walk away so they learn. Also we should avoid all ads that don't provide photos, they need to step up as we are the customer! Yeah!!! I feel better now with that speech

Yeah that is not on and good on you for walking out as i'm sure a few of us would have still honoured the booking even though they were clearly misleading!

My experience/comments : Found this masseuse on the net, and since my usual was closed and I was horny as a sperm whale, decided to try it out. I was led, step by step to the cnr of Eliz & Collins - then to 103 Eliz - the Formule 1 Hotel - nice n skanky! Finally got to her room, and it was tiny, but set up ok for the purpose.

Susanis attractive enough - didn't seem to be fully conversant of the ways of R&T but not dumb either. Massage was pretty good, and in no doubt about what was going to happen later.  She asked if I would come back, but I told her that she was expensive compared to others nearby, and that I wouldn't, even tho she was nice. She wanted to know where these other places were coz she wanted to get a job there! What am I? Employment Classifieds???

The then gave me the coup de gras that was meant to change my mind - if I brought a condom next time she would gibe me a BJ! LOL! 

Not very good VFM, but not bad for a bit of variety.

nocto

Yes if you are going punting, you should have a backup place that you know is alright. Then make the call if you have been mislead to fall back to your backup.

Mary does massage and waxxxing out of her small 2bedroom unit in Endeavour Hills.

Physically she seems to be carrying an injury perhaps she's had a stroke.
She is around the 50 mark and is okker Aussie but pleasant. Like your mum.
She does not provide an effective therapeutic massage. The room is filled with 
clothing bric a brac and the table is in the middle with no room for her to maneuver 
around. There were no extras and that was fine because I would not want any from 
someone who reminded me of my mum. It was actually painful as she tried to move around the
table constantly knocking into rubble around the room.
$30- 30mins. No would not recommend to anyone

I saw mary when she worked from Narre Warren. Worst massage ever! I believe she has been trained but it was terrible! I got HJ and CBJ for about extra $30. She wasnt very good at that either!
As per previous poster...not recommended!

I remember this lady when she worked out of shop in Dandenong, she was a shocker, the massage for 30min would be the top half of the back, flip and then the front top half, would not go near the plums and trunk, so agree with the others give a wide birth, i decided virtually at the flip it was not going any further and said i have to go, she was what seemed to be shocked. Anyway visit at your own peril, would be interested to know if it is me she just could not go near.

Iceman...I saw her at that time when she was just moving into that shop in Dandenong. I remember her telling me she wasnt giving any extras in the shop due to the more public profile ansd also her kid would be in the shop a fair bit.

Saw a new ad yesterday on Gumtree which looked interesting.

MASSAGE FOR THE EXECUTIVE | Massages | Gumtree Australia Kingston Area - Patterson Lakes

Executive massage performed by Female therapist offering head to toe massage Call for price and available times. Upon booking a mobile number will be required to secure your time slot Call Holly on 0497 378 804

Called and made a time for today. On route received a text saying she was free and if I was early that was OK. Arrived as advised at a new and gated community at Sandhurst (Near Patterson Lakes) and given the code to open the gates. Arrived at the house (new) and was greeted by Holly at the door. Blonde MILF in great shape wearing black compression pants (slight camletoe) and a tight t-shirt.
Had a great massage, no towel and plenty of deep groin work with many incidental brushes of the nuts. After the flip she seemed to enjoy me rubbing her arse and started pressing her tits against parts of my body whilst massaging me. With 15 minutes to go I started wondering and asked if she does whole body and sensual. She replied by saying what do you mean and I said I think you know. She then said, you will need to tell me exactly what you want.
This startled me a bit so I thought four things may be happening here:
1. She is not too smart (can't be, she is an articulate and smart woman)
2 She doesn't know what a fully erect penis is begging for (working in cameltoe pants and rubbing t-shirted tits against me I don't think so)
3 She is new and cautious
4 It was a Fun Police set-up trying to get evidence of solicitation.
Caution got the better of me so I said not to bother and we finished without a finish (ha that rhymes)
Within minutes of leaving she SMS'd me saying it was good to meet and come back soon.
I replied that if she could learn to read minds we could have a better booking. Have received no reply.
Not aware of any recent Fun Police activity targeting PML's lately so not too sure to know what to make of this.
If she is indeed a Keeper she would be a very welcome addition to the Melbourne scene.
Any ideas, personal experiences or speculations Guys?

Why wouldnt you have asked if she provided extra services such as relief or natural release however you want to say it?
Without being too specific  or just be straight up as she can only say NO or offer once she knows your NOT the fun police

Person's Name : Holly

Establishment : Private

Date of Visit : 29/05/2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0497 378 804

Hours of Business : Not sure

Rates : 30 mins - $50
           45 mins - $70
           60 mins - $90
           + extra $50 for HJ (In G-String)


Age : around 37

Size/shape : Blonde hair,About size 10, C cup natural tits,

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian

Services Provided : Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Not really

My experience/comments : 

Rang Holly to book, couldnt get hold of her but she texted me back 30 mins later. Arranged a time for the next morning but I was to call her before the booking to get the address.Texts were going back and forward all night...she changed my time 3 times before we settled on 11am. I got more texts from her the next morning and she changed the time twice more! So finally we agreed on 10am, I was to drive to her street in an estate which has a gate and pass code is needed to get in, then ring her when I arrived to get the code. All that went without a hitch...phewww!... and I arrived at her front door just after 10am.

Holly greeted me at the front door, almost new house, clean and tidy. She is Aust,maybe 37ish, about 5'5", athletic size 10 with large hips. Curly blonde hair and quite attractive.Very friendly and chatty. She showed me to a room with a massage table, low lighting etc and left me for a few minutes to undress.
She started the massage on my legs, no towel to cover, and pretty much straight into the brushing of the ball sack, and crack. Very light touch, pretty much a nothing massage, just a bit of a tease. Flipped over, more brushing etc ...I asked if HJ was available.. she said $50 done in her G-String. She stripped off to reveal a fantastic tan, great real tits with long dark nipples. She jumped on the table between my legs and gave a very good HJ to completion. Lots of ooh's and aah's while she wacked away. Doesnt do much for me that stuff...its obviously fake but hey, she at least made an effort to make it pleasurable. Quick clean up and on my way. No shower offered.

WIR...probably not, I paid $100 for 30 mins +HJ ...I guess it was not really worth that much.

I had a massage with Holly today.

Description is as the other two have mentioned. 

late 30's, blonde curly hair, about size 8. Fit Milf.

Greeted at door by her with tight tshirt and leggings on. As she turn she had her g string popping out the top of leggings.

Massage was average but she did start straight on the legs with some crack rubbing action.

$70 for 45 min and + $70 for nude with HJ. 

Great body, rubbed her beaver a bit but she was adamant no fingers inside. Think I could work on this after a couple visits.

Good technique with the HJ with some more crack rubbing and ball stroking involved. 

I would go back. Cute, friendly, average massage that got better and a good finish.

Shower provided after asking.

Think she has a couple kids at school so this might be the reason behind changing times etc.  although I must say I called this morning as was booked and on the table within 45 min.

Not certain why there would be any concern about individuals in a private situation worrying about solicitation. Unless I am mistaken if it takes place in a private situation as in on Private property as opposed to a parlour or club or public place such as a street, park etc then there would be no chance of a case for solicitation able to be proved. 
Police do not set up as private workers then give someone a massage dressed provocatively and then wait for someone to solicit a sex act. Whomever would suggest that as a way of catching potential criminals obviously has no clue about the limited resources of Vic Police not to mention the costs of setting up a private situation. Solicitation must take place in a public place or a parlour to be an offence.

This PML is just doing her bit to keep everyone guessing. She probably is more worried about council than anything else as council feels it has the right to spend ratepayers money catching "illegal workers" doing their thing but usually at places which have a DA for providing services other than a sex related service.

IMHO I doubt that anyone would set up a private situation who did not expect to be offering extras for tips if they dress in a certain way unless they are clueless. Most PML's you ask upfront and the majority will say yay or nay before the appointment or address is issued. Those that are wary because they don't do extras and try and get the client in under the art of the tease and the never never no way! Who or what do you take me for? been there done that (DejaVu)

This is why it is called punting. If it is a sure thing then it isn't punting. If there are no certainties then it is a punt. Happy trails.
Remember there are many potential Milfs and PML's or WL's who try for a time and then decide it is not for them. That decision is sometimes precipitated by the actions of punters. Be mindful there are ways to treat newbies and that is always gently so as not to scare them away unless their service really warrants them not being in business.
Conspiracies abound!

I may have to eat my hat along with a serving of my words. VicPol it appears has enough limited resources to set up the boss and sidekick at "Tiffany" massage in town. The bosslady got done for living off the earnings of a sex worker. The VicPol staged a four day operation would you believe to bust those Chinese Criminal masterminds masquerading as Vicpol at work. Apparently the planning meetings were done in the local watering hole. As were the celebratory drinks after goofing off for four days and then busting the Mamasan mastermind in her massaging moments. Incidentally the worker was released after arrest without charge. Was she "A mole"? Answer is self evident!
FMD VicPol need to get some real crims. But being Keystone cops can't workout WTF they are!

BTW Chances of getting a conviction if it goes to court and the defendant pleads not guilty are not great. But as the State of Victoria will bring all its might to bear the chances are this CML will plead guilty and save taxpayers a shitload of cash. Well hopefully but it could be interesting if she pleads "Not Guilty " Your Honour!

Wonder how the VicPol spend their time with all the intelligence which probably includes this site. 
Wonder if those members (VicPol) should arrest themselves for whacking off on the job! 
I can just hear them now. " Sorry your Honour I refuse to answer that question on the grounds that I may incriminate myself! "

Just went to see holly today. If you haven't been then save your money. She's not worth it at all. Looks great. YES! But what a shifty woman. Texted in the morning and made a time. Time confirmed and then called and spoke on the phone to confirm details. Asked how much and was told 80. 
Now I'm not a stupid guy and if your quoting those figures you automatically assume its for an hr..
So I rock up and yes an attractive girl mid thirties answers the door and leads me off into a clean room which must double up as an extra lounge. 
Get my gear off get on the table and she comes back and starts her massage. 5 minutes in she decides to tell me that btw its 80 for forty minutes. I lift my head and politely say, I assumed it was an hr.. No no, it's forty minutes. So I say well I should have confirmed and then she keeps goin with a very ordinary massage and no rubbing of any crack. 
On the roll she rubs me down gets very close to Stanley but doesn't touch. I tell her she's welcomentonmassage him too since she's so close to him.. She says yes she can but THAT'S AN EXTRA..I ask how much and she says 150 with her nude and you can't touch her pussy. 
So now there's ten minutes on the clock. I tell her that that she's out of her mind 80 dollars for forty minutes and an extra 70 for ten minutes of you nude and I can't touch the oyster. Ill give it a miss. I'd rather go home and satisfy the missus if she lets me or its off to beat the bishop....save your money for a better deal...some of these chicks think that gold flakes come out of their pussy and we can't touch it...this is one girl that won't see my money again. It is her loss because she could've got more out of me on a weekly basis if she had a head for business rather than a pussy for a cash grab...

I have a feeling that Holly or Judith is just a greedy MILF who believes that guys are stupid and there to keep her in the manner she has become accustomed to.

Reading between the lines I would say that Nextlife snaggles has been very generous in reviewing this scammer See Gumtree ad reviews.
She at least got on the board. Now if you are stupid enough to use your own ABN and then pretend you don't know who you are first name on the ABN is Judith then you really are dumb as.

Think    had it correct in the first place.

Overall Rating: 2 stars 2/5 
Just average but expensive
Holly( Judith) was very hard to contact to make a booking, then once made was changed three times by her. Very frustrating. Massage was just ok but on the expensive side.Thats probably the reason she ...doesnt include prices in her ads.  



Now I thought this review was spot on save for it gave her a higher rating than she probably should have got. So of course what does she do write a glowing review of herself.
Simple really adopt the tactics of Holiday Panic. If you look at their latest ad I used some reverse Psych on them. people like this are as dumb as shit.

The reason I am posting this is so that members can figure out for themselves. If it walks like a duck. If it quacks like a duck. If it looks like a duck. Well guess what It is a fcuking DUCK dear.

Read the forum. Trust the forum. Don't believe anyone who is clueless enough to return to see someone who def does not represent VFM and indeed who obviously is a scammer.

The raison debtre of the forum is to supply intel. Putting the intel together on Judith/Holly it is smart to trust the posts and heed the warning signs.
This is one greedy Mother to be avoided. Simple as that!

Business must be great for this woman as after numerous attempts I've given up.  She does reply on occasion but usually it's along the lines of "too busy - call be back at 9:00 on Wednesday (or whenever)".  On a few times I have tried to contact her at the time asked and still no response.

Felt like a massage and its local so why not,as mixed reviews
Greeted at the door TIGHT BLACK PANTS nice lady great body
Was taken to room $90 up front! 50 min massage!(LITTLE EXPENSIVE) had great chat more about our interest with kick boxing!!! which she clearly has done for many years!(!hence her chiseled  body) unfortunately the 30 min chat took the edge off what i originally wanted out of my massage!! nothing offered from her!!! nothing asked of from me (although i wanted to towards the end but to much talking)
Walked away happy and would go back again for the same experience as she was a friendly girl as we both had similar interests.

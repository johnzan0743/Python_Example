My experience/comments : I heard about this massage lady from a mate and thought I'll give it a go. Sent her a text asking for a 45 min massage which she promptly replied and booked in. I made the trip down to her place which looks a little ordinary. Knock on the door and Francis opens up. She invites me into the massage room which is actually also her bedroom. She asked me if I had any health issues while she took some notes. She ten left me to undress and jump on the massage table. She returned and started the massage. The massage was awesome just the right pressure. On the flip, I asked her if she would do a sensual massage which she agreed. Nice long strokes and teasing around the little man. Just before the tug, I asked if she would take her top off which she agree to without a thought. She stood over my head and gave me a great tug while I her tits were on my chest and I was feeling her arse over her tights.I blew my load and she cleaned me up. She left and came back with a hot towel to wash off the oil, which came off easily. A good value punt.
 She charged me an extra $10 for the tug however it may be a YMMV. Another quick tip is that her partner is home sometimes generally after hours so be careful if going there late arvo early evening.

 Sharni - Highett - 0497 489 722
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Sharni

Establishment : Private home

Date of Visit : October 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0497 489 722

Hours of Business : Daytime til about 7pm

Rates : 100 ph +

Age : late 30's I would say

Size/shape : Slim 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Phillipino I reckon..

Services Provided : Sensual lomi massage

Value for money/recommend? : overpriced / nah

My experience/comments : sharni sounds nice on the phone, was picturing a hot blonde woman with a hot tan, big boobs and sexy clothing. spoke about this lomi sensual massage, she made a point of saying it is all about the connection between us. thought hey this could turn into an awesome massage.

Then sharni opened the door, she is okay looking but was not expecting what would appear to be a phillipino lady. she is naturally tanned, tight black leggings and black singlet with shoulder length straight hair.

massage was with a small towel covering me, but her hands were very teasing and 'sensual' during the massage. when massaging my legs she made a point to rest then toughly against her soft boobies, which still had the singlet top on. I was doing the best to improve 'the connection' between us... oh yes, wow your hands are really amazing, it's getting hot in here, the usual wiggle of the butt with sigh of satisfaction when she got a bit close, but no cigar as yet

on the flip she dimmed the lights further and smiled at me. small towel still covering my mountain. she massaged under my body taking her mouth quite close to the towel, that was hot to look at, but as the massage got further and further into it, i realised that that was pretty much as close as I was going to get, and didnt want to straight ask for a handy this time, so pretended to enjoy the rest of the massage

she soon finished. i showered, then she offered me a loyalty card. yeah good luck with that one. she then said she can do a more sensual one next time for $150 with her topless. but i still got teh vibe that perhaps hand relief was not an option.

anyway - nice enough girl and would be great if she actually did hj, but too pricey for the service she offered me. 

anyone else had success with this one?

For a moment it sounded awefully similar to Jennifer. Slim, filo, singlet top...

Might have to give this lady a go!

I was tempted after seeing her ad on Gumtree but it looked a little too legit. Thanks for TOFTT

I think this person is a waste of time. I haven't visited her but I have spoken to her a few times on the phone. First off she advertises under 2 names on gumtree which is always suspicious. She talks on the phone about her different levels of "sensual" massage. They go up to $250 per hour with her in a g string but no genital touching at all. She won't be seeing me and my money anytime soon!

It's pretty simple.If she's too expensive don't see her and if enough blokes do that she may well drop her prices to something a bit more realistic.

Surely she would do a HR if she offers topless?

I called her up for an appointment and since she couldn't fit me in, she referred me to another masseur who operates in St Kilda, next to Club Cali. This is the website for the joint:

Enliven Lomi Massage Studio

Person's Name : Hailey

Establishment : Enliven Studio

Date of Visit : Nov 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Enliven Lomi Massage Studio

Hours of Business : Daytime til about 8pm

Rates : 100 ph +

Age : mid-late 20s

Size/shape : size 8-10

Nationality or Ethnicity : Filo/Aussie mix

Services Provided : Sensual lomi massage

Value for money/recommend? : A little expensive for what it is...

This masseur was also a Filo/Aussie mix, mid/late 20's a few tats, not bad looking, nice olive skin dressed in leggings and crop top/singlet. She gave me a great lomi lomi, but I didn't ask for extras. I did see a box of tissue there, so anything's possible. She was very nice and personable; during the massage she covered my ass crack with a small sarong, but after 5 minutes she took it off; on the flip she also covered my crotch with that small flimsy cloth. I reckon more could be on offer once trust is gained, but at $100 an hour, and with TM down the road...

Oh, apparently Sharni works here sometimes also. Furthermore, confirmed that Sharni is not Jennifer - despite same ethnic background, location, etc. I've got an appointment to see Sharni this week - she is literally a few minutes walk from Jen's...

I have seen both Hayley and Sharni recently.

Massage is ok with plenty of teasing. Overpriced for what it is.

However they speak English !!!

Sharni is DEFINITELY not Jennifer. Forget Sharni and go see Jenn, twice the pleasure and less cost. You'll wonder why you ever went to see Sharni.

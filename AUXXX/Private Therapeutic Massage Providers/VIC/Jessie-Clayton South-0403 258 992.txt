Found this lady's ad in the local Leader newspaper and hadn't seen it before so I thought I would see what she has to offer.I was quoted $50 for half an hour which seemed too high to not offer something extra and she said that I could come straight away so I made my way to Clayton South.When I arrived at the house I realised that I had been there before some years ago and thought that if I had not returned it must have meant that I wasn't that impressed with the service.I nearly kept driving but for some reason decided to go in anyway-I should have kept driving...
There were 2 late model Corollas in the driveway,which indicated to me the presence of more than one asian woman (when I booked,I could hear other voices in the background).There was also a derelict old Commodore on the lawn and a pair of workboots on the doorstep,which indicated at least one male resided there.The door was opened by a reasonably attractive asian woman in a short,tight dress and I was shown to a back room with a bed.Walking through the house,it was clear that it was someone's residence but I couldn't remember if this lady was the one I had seen there a few years ago.
In the back room I handed over $50 and she asked if I wanted half an hour or....and before she finished the sentence I said half an hour.I imagine she was going to offer me some other service for less time but I didn't wait for her to finish the sentence.Anyway,I lay on the bed and waited for her to return after she hid the money.Upon her return she commenced the "massage",which consisted of her brushing my belly and legs about 3 times and then going for my dick.Oil was applied and she tried to wake my dick up-at this stage I realised that I should have laid on my stomach to start off because I knew that once I had blown I would be shown the door,regardless of how much of the half hour remained.
After about 10 minutes the doorbell rang and she then yelled out to someone,which turned out to be another lady that I didn't know was there and they had a conversation in their mother tongue outside the bedroom.I didn't need to understand the language to know what was being said-I knew that I was going to be out the door asap and another bloke would be lying on this bed in a few minutes time.
Sure enough when the lady returned she resumed tugging at a furious pace because everyone knows that the harder and faster you pull a penis,the quicker it ejaculates.I was having none of this and told her to slow down,which she did for a few seconds and it was clear that I wasn't going to win this battle.After a few more minutes of barely average tugging and some nipple biting she had me over the line and then,before even cleaning me up.asked "Do you mind if I finish now?".If figured that any answer other than "Not at all" would have been met with a bad attitude and an even worse experience in the remaining time,so that's what I said.
She fetched my shoes and then rushed me out the back door but I made sure to get her name as I was leaving because such a fine service provider needs to have her name out there.All up I was there for no more than 15 minutes so it wasn't great value.
Incidentally,this house is literally around the corner from the much reviewed Cindy and I'm surprised there are no reviews of this woman or premises because it has been operating as such for quite a few years now.
Unless you're up for the challenge of trying to get the full time you pay for from someone who doesn't want to give it to you,avoid this house and go and see Cindy instead.

Hi,
I found her ad in Herald Sun on a Monday. They have a series of classified ads in the Health and Living section.
Cheers

South Melb Nextlife.
When I said to Pete extras were available that was the impression I got not what I experienced.

It seems I have been a mug and Marie is actually Liz/Marlene/Lucy.
Nextlife has identified her. See his entry at Liz East Bentleigh 0431678101.
Sorry for posting a misleading review but I took her at face value.

Hi Guys,

FWIW I took one for the team last week.  Rang - made the booking all pretty normal.  Was really looking forward to a non asian massage.  Well I guess that is exactly what I got!  A lot of massage - come flip time, while staring at my boner, she quietly says "I don't do this anymore".  Mores the pity could have become a regular.

I made a booking with her last Friday but had to cancel due to work and sent her a text asking if I could reschedule to next week. Five minutes later she called me giving me an almighty spray for cancelling.  She was going on about people doing this to her all the time and why its a pain in the arse that she has to wait until next week to get the $80 from me. WTF??
Will be giving this one a huge wide berth

A word of warning, I am pretty sure she is on drugs and she has infections and gets sick regularly. She smokes like a chimney and her place is a mess. She can go completely psycho and is annoying as hell.

Very big call to say "She is on drugs" either you know 100% or not... Suggest be more mindful with your claims. If your experience punting with this girl is poor then let your fellow punters know about it.

The only drug I'd be willing to bet she's on is estrogen, not because she's in menopause, but because she's a tranny!

Why do you say she is a tranny Waylaid? She didn't look like one to me.

Fwiw - when I visited her place was very tidy and while her chatter was a bit here and there (which massage girl isn't like that - you are not there to discuss TS Eliot) I certainly didn't think she was on drugs and inho not a tranny.

One thing for sure, she cannot spell. The word "Europe" is basically the same in most European languages. 

On the other hand, maybe she was educated by one of our teachers who cannot spell or use correct grammar these days.

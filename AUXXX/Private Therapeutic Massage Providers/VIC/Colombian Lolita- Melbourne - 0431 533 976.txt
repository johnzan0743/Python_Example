Value for money/recommend? : maybe pricey 

My experience/comments : Saw pics and decided to book. Upon entry was told to get ready and face down on table while she left the room. A few minutes later she returns and starts the massage. Not really much of a massage but there was the occasional bump of the little fella. Then the flip came and I was surprised to see she was already topless and more of the same weak massage then she started the tug. Maybe I was horny and she did let my hands roam a little which got me over the line.

You can get nude HJ with DATY, cat bath, body slide and a brass marching band from $70/hh and $100/h in the suburbs if you shop around, so $140/hh for a topless tug is OTT.

For a couple of years now there has been a group offering young and attractive girls (generally non-Asian) at these prices. Extras on top are both limited and expensive, and I steer clear of them for that reason. You can pick the ads a mile off:

Photos are generally taken in newer apartmentsFaces are pixelated outPricing is $140/30 and $250/60Disclaimer about no sex, no extrasOften offer used panties for sale, and non-sexual fetishes

I reviewed my one visit to this stable a few years ago and upon reflection would not recommend.

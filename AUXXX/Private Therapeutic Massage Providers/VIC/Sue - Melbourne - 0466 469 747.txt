My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.) Visited Sue yesterday for the first time as rarely see a Fijian Indian advertise in Melbourne. Called and made an appointment. No hassles with messages and call backs as a receptionist handles calls and bookings. Arrived and greeted warmly. Small appartment with partitioned massage booths. Not all the way to the ceiling so noise may be an issue. Great massage and not long into it before discussing add-ons (HJ Nude CBJ). Went with the Nude HJ for an extra $80 and enjoyed a lot of attention and mutual touching. When returning from the shower saw a super cute Asian girl. Will have to go back for that.

Throw in the complimentary 3FF, DATY and GS (which was a first for her and she loved it) and it makes for a good visit!!!!!!

So is she a solo private operator or is it an apartment operating as a parlour like so many in the CBD?

Yes,I did read your review,that's why I asked.Three girls and a fluffer is hardly a "private massage lady" is it?

This is decided upon by the moderating team. In cases like this, it is considered to be closer to a PML than an Establishment. Strictly speaking it isn't either, but this is the way we have always treated such reviews.

Sorry Toomuchtime, I should have typed "Three Private Ladies and a Fluffer". Sounds a bit like a crappy movie starring Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell.

When Sue was on Hoddle St, there used to be a girl called Sarah.

Used to give great sensual massage. She is caucasian and medium built with decent breasts. Does anyone know whereabout of this ML?

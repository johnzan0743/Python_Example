My experience/comments : 

I replied to Mardis Gumtree ad and received an email back within 30 mins. Was able to arrange a massage at my house the next day 6pm. She explained she only does massage part time and can only come after work.
She arrived on time ...tiny little thing...massage table she was carrying was almost as big as her.Took her a couple minutes to set up, paid my money up front , stripped off and onto the table. The massage was quite firm but very monotonous, just moving from one part of the body to another then repeating the sequence. Correspondence prior had indicated full body massage was on offer. Sadly this was not the case. She only massaged my back and back of legs and I even had to ask her to massage my glutes. (Which she did quite well). Didnt ask me to turn over to do my front. After some time she indicated the massage was finished. I looked at the clock...45 mins...I had paid for an hour but I didnt care. I was glad it was over.
Would I book her again? Absolutley not.

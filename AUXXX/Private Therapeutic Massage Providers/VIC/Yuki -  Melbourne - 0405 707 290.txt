Post Content: 
Person's Name:Yuki

Establishment: private

Date of Visit:10/06/2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 0405 707 290

Hours of Business: 11am - late

Rates:$100 / hr

Age: 23

Size/shape:8-10

Nationality or Ethnicity: Japanese

Services Provided: Massage + Happy Ending

Value for money/recommend?: Sexy girl with the smoothest skin, same price but a bit more could get you FS. 

Comments: Usual procedure, go in and greeted by a middle aged Mamasan. Shown into the room which was very clean with dim lighting. Walls were actually not paper thin which was good for  Asked to strip and get onto the table. In comes Yuki and after some chit-chat "have you been here before" and "what do you want?" she stripped and then began the massage with long soft strokes and some tickling coming ever closer to the family jewels. She did this thing where she breather warm air onto my neck which mad the little fella awaken. On the flip and with some oil she dove strait into a HJ but it was a bit hard for my liking. It took a while and in the end I was glad it was over as it was getting a little painful. She needs a lesson that fast and furious is not a way to make a quick finish. 

WIR? Only to try someone else, given the price I would go for FS at another establishment.

Mate,

This sounds like a commercial massage venue, it has a mamasan, rooms etc.

Could you please advise which business this is, which city and suburb it operates in.

Cheers


Chalk

My experience/comments :  Saw Maya recently while I was in Melbourne and i'll admit the I am a novice at the Melbourne punting scene. I've seen mixed reviews of other providers from the Ally Thomas stable and unfortunately this was not particularly a successful punt for me. So consider this a continuation of those mixed results.



Booking Maya was relatively easy but there were a few times where contact was a bit hit and miss. I asked if my preferred time was good for her only to not get a reply. I know we had agreed on a time but I still like to get that final confirmation text just to make sure. Even when I arrived at said time and I sent a message it was close to 15mins before I got a reply. I was so close to walking when I was given instructions.



With how the booking went I probably should have. I said in the template that "we didn't click" and that may be all it was as I'm not the most outgoing guy. But for the list of services that were "included" in her massage service it was only the CBJ that was delivered on. I kinda like to go with the flow in a booking so I didn't really press her on the other stuff as it would have felt forced, therefore probably would not have been enjoyable for either of us anyway.



So to sum up, Maya is quite attractive, slim with nice features but for me the service was very lacking. Maybe massage is not her thing, maybe it was me, who knows. I'll just chalk it up to "you win some you lose some"

Boy what a rip off. I would be mad too madman. 
$250 for a shit massage and a CBJ?
Yesterday in Preston I got a BBBJ with a drop dead gorgeous girl for $80 all up. Admittedly it was 20 mins and no massage, not an hour, but 20 minutes is long enough for me.

bryan - 'Would you care to share the gorgeous girl in Preston jersy? HAHAHA"

Mickle & bryan, Yes I will write a review of Chanel when I am ready and have time.

Seems funny getting prodded by you 2 punters Mickle & bryan to write a review.
I just checked my punting diary. My full reviews over the last 2 years and 3 months is as follows:
2018 - I wrote 30 full reviews, not comments on other peoples reviews, actual reviews of girls
2019 - I wrote 24 full reviews, not comments on other peoples reviews, actual reviews of girls
2020 - so far I have written 6 full reviews, not comments on other peoples reviews, actual reviews of girls

So in the past 2 years and 3 months I have reviewed 60 girls. So as you can see I write plenty of reviews.

I just checked the total between the 2 of you and I suggest you start writing a few reviews yourselves, as you are still bronze members. 
Because when I do write my review on Chanel, it will be in the therapeutic massage forum. 
So get to it fellas, write a few more reviews yourselves and eventually you will get silver membership and be able to read my review on Chanel.

Cheers, happy punting fellas, and keep those reviews rolling in.

Magnificently put Jersy.

Critics who are too lazy to write a review or simply live their punting life vicariously through others deserve to be reminded of their place in the scheme of things.

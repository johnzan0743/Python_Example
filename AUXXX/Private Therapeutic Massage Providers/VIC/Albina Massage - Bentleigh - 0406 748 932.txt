Saw her a couple of months ago in Caulfield I think.
Excellent massage where I was covered with a huge sheet the whole time except for the area being attended to.
It was all very legit but extremely arousing none the less. She gave me a frequent flyers card and told me that on subsequent visits she "goes much deeper" once she gets to know the client. I haven't been back but it begs the question.

Yes i must say after looking at this ladys website that it appears she is fairly clueless as to why she has had such a reaction.
She posted some fairly suggestive pictures on her webpage and just doesn't understand why guys would think she does more?...

Gimme a break. According to a kiwi friend she did more than just massage but this is possibly why she left NZ. The fact is she couldn't make a go of it and used the Shaky Isles as a stepping stone to Oz. just like the Chinese do. It is easy to get into NZ and then get a passport and fly into Oz with the TTMRA as the hello welcome mat is out.

I don't think this girl is here to do anything other than what she wants and pleases her...bugger the boys appears to be her motto...but you know what they say...cash is king.
Frankly I wouldn't bother as she is not that hot in person.. and her pics are touched up and she has heaps of makeup and a stylist photo shoot...

She is rather plain looking in person. Having met her and deciding not to bother, more than anything perhaps us mug punters should realise that individuals out there that are willing to exploit our Governments lack of border controls by coming in the back door so to speak should really be shown the front door as the last thing we really need is another exploitative body draining taxpayer funds supporting their lifestyle ambitions because they can lie and manipulate the system but not anyones cocks... at least not here and not anymore... 

The reality is she did far more for certain individuals in NZ than she is willing to do out here in Oz.
The prices she is charging are based upon a R'N'T service in NZ not a standard practice of any style of massage seen here.

As for the Reference well that says zip about her and makes you wonder why she has a lawyer writing references..

Anyway you guys can check it out for yourselves and see the reasons to avoid this type of individual who is FOS and just wants to milk the men of Oz as the Kiwis had no cash...
She is a Prick teaser and she knows it...why else the pics on her website...she is far from stupid or ignorant.

So best thing fellas if you want to keep the cash is avoid Albina Khalilova and her excuse for service...

To be fair on her she is upfront to a degree about exploiting punters as she states she does not do nude or erotic massage...at least not at the moment she feels threatened by websites like this one...

Question arises why have pics on your website that are suggestive?... Some of which have now been removed...

There are alarm bells ringing here when Russian brides get to come and live and exploit this land without having a Groom to show for it.

The one thing Russia does well is work the mind over the does it really matter...

So you can understand more about this one here is the weblink..

Massage and Beauty



She makes a claim to be a Licensed massage therapist which is a term pertinent only to the USA. Certainly not in NZ or here in Oz....so she cannot live up to her "so-called" reference as she obviously lies enough to manipulate the system...she is of course here on a kiwi passport...

A word to the wise Just don't bother unless you have too much cash to spend after Chrissy ...there are plenty of better punts in Melbourne that won't exploit you and will leave you grinning...

Just one comment, I often here these comments about emigrants sponging of of us. Usually, and particularly in relation to the Trans Tasman thing, they are not entitled to any social security for quite a longtime after they get here. This means they are more likely to work harder than our slack Aussies. More immigrants I say- cheap labour (of various kinds) for us, with minimal cost (mainly just Medicare once they start paying taxes).

Also,is it correct that the lady in question gets access to the forum after posting 2 one line "reviews"?I thought you had to post 2 comprehensive reviews of sessions where extras were provided to qualify for access?

Value/recommend? : depends what you are after

I had been wanting to check Albina out for a while due to her hot photos and the way she advertises herself it seems like there are extras available. But after reading this thread I thought it wasn't worth it but I was still tempted thinking worst case scenario is a decent massage. Albina is quite attractive in person as well, naked massage under towel. Was decent massage with a few light brushes when I was on my stomach. So I thought maybe the possibility of extras is there but she never mentioned it and I decided not to ask. She said at the end 'we can go deeper next time' but from previous posts it looks she just means a deeper massage. I may give her another go later on and just ask for extras the massage itself was good so i don't think it will be a loss even if the answer is the likely no.

p.s. It looks like she has changed address over the last week and it also says walk ins available.....I'm wondering if someone other than her is working at the new place?

Hey PB do you think that there may be a chance that the tease might turn over a new leaf? Or should that read turn over a nude leap and perhaps shake hands with the Mrs? I say this because starting a new shop where she employs girls will eventually lead her to bankruptcy unless she starts doing or permits the tug to happen in her shop. If no way then how long do you think she will remain in business?

+1....

Take it from someone who has been caught in the crossfire in a raid on unlicensed premises, you absolutley DO NOT want to be there when they raid. A few years ago there was a raid on a massage place in Chadstone (shop front). There were cops in 2 unmarked police cars parked across the road watching, and as each punter left the shop they were grabbed by a couple of plain clothed detectives, taken away and booked. I was grabbed as I came out but luck was on my side as all the girls were busy when I went in and the waiting  time for a girl was an hour so I left. 2 coppers grabbed me as I left but apparently they didnt see me go in (a bus blocked their view as I went in)and they couldnt be sure how long I was  in there. This was the only thing that saved me. But I was still taken to their car and put through an interrogation for about 30 mins...I think their main aim was to make me admit that I had gone there to get a massage and hand relief. Of course I denied citing a crook back, but all through it I was put under plenty of pressure. I was informed in no uncertain terms that just being inside an unlicensed brothel is an offence and I could be charged by summons and would have to appear in court.In the end I was given the benefit of the doubt, given a stern warning and my details were taken. Now I dont go to shop front massage parlours, only ever private ML's working from home. I always arrive early and drive up and down the street a few times checking out cars parked in the vicinity.
 Better to be safe than sorry....

This is a little OT but should be said.


Yes Gotta say with the Vicpol it is mostly about the bluff. Never worry if you get caught coming out of the shop or a place that advertises for massage. You can only sink yourself if you volunteer the information. Whilst we don't really have the right to remain silent in this country we do have the right not to incriminate ourselves.
Now the VicPol are full of shite. The unlicensed brothel must be proscribed. The facts never get in the way with VicPol. 

The simple truth is unless it is proscribed premises which the notice is required to be posted in a prominent place so you don't enter into the premises unless you want trouble or are the landlord or the landlords agent serving notices. 

Frankly the bully boy tactics are laughable. If you know the law they won't waste time on you. They will try and bluff a confession out of you. However they are not permitted to detain you without arresting you. Of course the longer they talk to you the more likely you are to trip up.

It is simple. You cannot be found guilty of entering an unlicensed brothel unless you are aware. The situation where you are aware is called "Mens Rea" which is Latin for guilty mind or of a guilty mind. The Police cannot charge you unless they can prove you were entering Proscribed premises with intent to commit an offence. It is all rather simple. Keep your mouth shut and if they ask you a question and you feel pressured then stick to the Nextlife story of I have a bad back and was going in for a genuine massage.

Now comes the disclaimer. None of the above should substitute for legal advice or simple common sense. 

The police do not have evidence of you breaking the law unless you cough up and confess. This is the way they get most evidence. The VicPolice also will lie and bullshit you to get what they want or need. This type of behaviour is in other jurisdictions considered to be corrupt. However one mans crime is another mans pleasure guilty or not.  

The best way around this is to follow Nextlife's advice and frequent Privateers or operations that have only two workers on the premises.That and being aware and alert at all times. Premises are not unlawful until they are proscribed according to Vic laws. Most coppers are clueless and that is why we have courts to sort out the lack of evidential material from the verballing BS. 
That used to be the norm before the NSW Woodward Royal Commission into Police Corruption  and how most charges were brought before the Local Courts in NSW. Face it the gang warfare the Mafia, triads and organised crime do not set up small parlours to launder cash.

 The VicPol are not spending the taxpayers money wisely if they continue to pursue these outfits and the cost of putting them out of business temporarily or overnight as bail is always given. 

Face it the coppers love doing the easy work. A parlour is a static target. But the business isn't. The business closes one day and opens the next at a different location. VicPol are just basically lazy. Why go after the hard targets when the soft ones are easy pickings. If you want to respect any VicPolice respect the traffic branch. At least they don't pretend to be your friend. You know you are getting the ticket no matter what you say. 

Rant over.

Thanks for the heads up PB. Get yourself TFOOT and make sure the guys don't get your plate. If you have to catch a cab and walk back to your car.

So the above post is in reference to the Russian Tease's new shop or does it refer to another thread? Nice headwear! (Female VicPol Cap) - (for future reference when PB changes Icon) 

Hey PB why don't you ring the Seven Network or the Nine network and tip the news team off. That way the stakeout will be over and perhaps they can get back to real Police work!

After a forced financial hiatus with massage's, I had some overdue cash and decided to venture out. Down to Station St booked my fav but had to kill an hour or so. Strolled down the street to Brilliana's after reading it had changed location to Heritage and did a walk in for a pre dinner Russian cocktail before Station St fully aware of previous comments and just hoping for a relaxed hour. I was greeted by the said Russian teaser and handed over the $90 for the 1hr lomi. The Thai girl was sitting next to the desk and choose her as she too was quite tasty. Maybe early 20's, pretty with a nice bod and friendly smile. Shown to the room, nicely presented BUT the walls don't go to the ceiling. What followed was a nice massage with a nice friendly girl of which I never got her name sorry. The style of strokes was very Thai with the occasional glance of the boys but on roll over not even close. The term Lomi is now being used by most as an extra $ earner, no different here for an extra 10 bucks. Be warned this massage was far from a Lomi.
 As for the walls!!!!  For 45mins I endured an unprofessional loud conversation of Russian diatribe between a male and the teaser, loud ring tones of various phones and a front door that opens onto a busy and loud South Road. For the final 15mins I was left stranded on the table waiting for what seemed eternity as the Thai girl went to get some warm water only to be handed the bucket and a cloth on her return. I'll see you outside after you wash yourself up!  As for your loyalty card fat chance I will be returning, at least at Station St they wash you down and dry you even if it is with a used rag. Brilliana Relax NOT!

I too ventured in here recently to see if things had changed with Albina. She suggested she had other girls working who do "sensual" massage so I met a Hungarian and a Thai. As mentioned above the Thai lady is very tasty in fact I think she is rather hot so I chose an hour with her. (Sorry I don't remember her name either). I like to sort things out from the start so when she escorted me to the room I asked if her sensual massage meant looking after all parts of the body to which she answered yes its very sensual. I said yes, but that doesn't really answer my question so I asked again. This time she answered properly and said no. I pushed a bit but could tell I was getting no where fast. I asked to see Albina again, When she came into the room I quoted that she promised sensual massage but seems not all parts are looked after. Albina answered no, none of us do that. I explained that was what I was looking for and got my money back and nicked off, no hard feelings.

Won't be returning too soon!

Well there you go! The economics of R&T!
No R&T and you get no Client traffic and the Staff get no base payment let alone overly generous tips. They soon enough scuttle like rats from a sinking ship to more lucrative employment.
Then the rent and overheads get beyond incoming revenues and you decide to sell.
Sell what? An unexpired lease on a premises whereby numerous similar and vacant shops are within a 2 km radius and a cheap fit-out.
I do hope though Pearl from Greece pops up soon in a more fun friendly shop!

Went today for the first time and had success with Pearl.
Massage was just a sensual tickle rather than a massage, and she didn't expect to be tipped but I gave ger $20 tip, all up $100 for the hour including tip.
She said she has only tugged 3 guys and only does it if she likes them not for money.
I am sure this is a line, so keen to get more views.
She is pretty sexy though.

I've been visiting this place for about 5 years. The first few years it was legit, the standard of massage was high but no extras. I was OK with that, if I wanted a good massage I would go there if I wanted extras I would go somewhere else.
Over the last few years extras have been offered but standard of massage has dropped and the girls that are there now are more focussed on the extras than the massage. The extras are also quite expensive: $50 HJ, $75 Topless HJ, $100 Nude HJ. This is on top of the massage price. A couple of times I have said yes to the extras but usually regretted it afterwards as I didn't feel the extras were worth it. I.e. I could have saved the cash and spent it at a brothel
Yesterday I was having a Lomi Lomi massage and really just wanted the massage. It was a Phillipino girl (I think her name is Sheena) I have seen a few times before. Her massage is good but not exceptional. Her extras are good but not exceptional. 
This time she offered a CBJ for $150. I declined because I know I can get more for the same money elsewhere. 
Considering the comment Albina made in this forum a few years ago, I was a bit stunned by the offer. The place has gone 180 degrees from the legit, high quality massage of a few years ago. FS can't be too far away...

Did Albina herself ever offer any extras there ?
I used to see her years ago when she worked out of her flat in Bentleigh. Never got anything there

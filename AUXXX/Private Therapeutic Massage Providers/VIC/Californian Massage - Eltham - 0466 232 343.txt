 Californian Massage - Eltham - 0466 232 343
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name :   unknown

Establishment :   private home

Date of Visit : 5/6/11

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :   leadernews: californian

Hours of Business : 10-8

Rates :   $90

Age : 30s mid

Size/shape : solid athletic, 14DD

Nationality or Ethnicity :   US accent

Services Provided :   HJ, BBBJ

Value for money/recommend? :   absolutely

My experience/comments : (Here you must give at least a general description of the experience which you have had - 25 word minimum is required to give fellow members an idea of time spent - "Ill be back" or "good value" is not a sentence or review. )

Easy appointment organised. Greeted at the door with a firm handshake, trying to suss you out. Very chatty, friendly girl. 

Starts with a firm massage, very strong hands. It bit predictable after a while, gets close to inner thighs. Once you're over she keeps towel to keep you modestly, and comes very close to contact. Strategically massages so towel falls slightly. Great upper body massage and stomach. Then naturally moves down to and finishes off with great HJ. Very amorous, seems like she enjoys what she does, be nice.

Can anyone else comment?

Tricky, thanks for that info. Was it $90 all up for massage , HJ and bbbj? Or did you have to pay extra?
Also you mention bbbj in services offered but don't mention it in  the description. Can you shed more light?
Have also seen them advertise an ' Aquatic ' massage with the same mobile number.
That piqued my interest.

Ah Tricky
No contact details provided.
Old review containing miss information
And not forthcoming with contact details
when queried.
I do believe you would be a better fit for the
International Sex Guide forum. That's the kind of
crap they thrive on

I'd don't have contact details, however, all the information required to find are available (Californian aka Aquatic massage - via leader news)
The fact that she isn't advertising at the moment, thus you can't find number doesn't make this review misinformed.

Your standards are obviously different to mine. 
But I'll stand corrected once you contribute a review
of any merit

Phone No for a start should be in yuor phone if you check hard, address should be easy to remember as you actully went there, leader news= which leader news at least as there are different one for each councils so yes there was alot of information easy to put on....


PacificBrown no your standards are perfectlly normal as i would expect the same  Maybe we should do reviews with all the stuff missing and see how they feel..

Chaps.. The forum for all is about giving and taking.. That is what keeps it going..

Missing information and contact details does not help others to visit.. We like to have benefit of doubt and
that it will be forthcoming and gives back to others when it is known..

That number is correct, here is a link to an ad they have, not much info at all though, basically just a title and a phone number.

I saw her just before she left for holidays in start of feb 2012.

Nice girl, size 12-14 and nice D cup boobs. Cant massage but more then makes up for it with extras. I have seen her 4 times now and from 2nd visit onwards I have received BBBJ and CIM and loves getting DATY. I always pay $300 for 1 hr of bodyslides, light kissing, mutual oral and then she always finishes with CIM (and then runs to the sink lol)

Has offered FS to me but wanted extra 100 (total 400) so declined as I couldnt see extra $100 value when I could get a very nice sensual BBBJ.

Interesting that the first review was about a draped massage that eventuated in a HJ. Then the last review goes right to FS. Goes to show that there's usually more on offer if you do the hard yards!

Mate if I would but if they call my bluff, I mean there's no chance I'll be going in with $400 in cash 
and also if I did have the cash, they'd have to be spectacular looking. Yes, I'm a tight arse!

I would also not pay 400 .... specially since for 400+ there are so many more pretty escorts who charge 400+ and give a much nicer experience

I went a couple of weeks ago and tried every trick in the book to get something out of her.  Lovely girl and nice massage but appears to be legit only.

My experience/comments : Came upon frontpage and it felt like the girls advertised on the site are all from the same establishment. I prefered someone with bigger boobs and came upon Chelsea. Making a booking was easy. Arrived at her place, girl in the pics were here, I could hear other girls in the apartment as well. She was really good looking with a really nice figure and pierced nipples. She didn't look enthusiastic at all. Asked me to lie on my front, proceeded to give me the lamest massage ever. At a certain point she applied oil on me and tried what felt like a really awkward body to body rub. This went for what felt like ages and then she asked me to flip over. The lame massage continued. She wasn't against me touching her cooch or her boobs. I personally don't like fingering, so I am not sure if this is on menu. Massage went on for a short while and then she jerked me off.

I wouldn't go for her again but I still would be open to trying one of the other girls.

That whole group is hit and miss and yes Frontpage is setup by the pimp.  If you go back make sure you have the right money as surprise surprise they can't change a 50.

They also swap girls out. I once booked a girl thinking she was Indian (as per the ad), and they sent in a Somali girl.  As if I am some dumb Caucasian that doesn't know the difference.,

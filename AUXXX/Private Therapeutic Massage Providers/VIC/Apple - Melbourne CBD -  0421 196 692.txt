My experience/comments : 
Got the contact fromWeChat, I was after half hour massage with BJ at the end. During our chat inWeChat, rates given to me was $70 for half hour massage with HJ......$90 for BJand S110 for FS

I went for$90.....half hour massage with BJ. Got the address through Chat. When went tothe private apartment in there were two girls working. Not sure the name of theother girl but Apple came with me (I was not given any choice).

When went in room,there was no massage table but double bed only. any way she took off herclothes and when I try to touch her, she stopped me and told me it is notincluded. 

She started withmassage and after few minutes she asked me if she can do the BJ where I askednot yet but she insisted and was really rood. When I said yes she started withCBJ and in few minutes when I got over the line, she started leaving the room.It was only 10-15 minutes since we were in the room, when I asked she saidpeople only come here to relief and it is over now. She did not listen to meand left the room. 

Overall verydisappointed punt……...waist of money and time

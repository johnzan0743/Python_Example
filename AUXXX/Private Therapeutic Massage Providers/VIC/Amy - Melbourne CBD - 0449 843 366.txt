Date 22 April 2016

Location: Boronia - private residence

Value for money: Not for me

Service: Massage with Handrelief for $70. $30 extra for CBJ (she asked for $50 initially)


**Tour To Melbourne!Sexy & Sensual Massage Offer @ $70/30 Mins!!!Wait No MORE!!! - Melbourne escorts - backpage.com

When I did a google search I found the images in the ad on lots of other websites but when I saw her she looked similar although she is probably not the same person. She said I could feel her body and get massage and hand relief with her naked for $70. It seemed like a bargain because most shops in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne charge $100 for nude massage - which I always though was crazy because you can get full service for $110.

As it so turned out she was only willing to go topless and only allowed me to feel her arms and legs.

The massage was too firm for my liking. She rubbed her boobs on my back.

She was very keen to get the $50 extra for CBJ but I refused until she brought it down to $30 although she still said I'm not allowed to touch any where apart from legs and arms (after I paid) and didn't remove the rest of her clothes. Later, while she was sucking me she put my hand on her boobs, which were firm, and obviously fake.

She works out of a private residence. I felt a bit nervous when leaving because she is part of a group of units and other residents could see me leaving. Are they suspicious about all these men popping in?

The ad says she is in Collins Street in the CBD?

My experience/comments : Ok, so I had seen this new place that had just opened up on Gilbert Rd as I travel that way for work frequently so thought I would give it a go. It was mid morning on a Tuesday ion another cold Melbourne winters day, went in and you could tell that the place had just had a touch up, new lick of paint etc. Was quiet clean & fresh but cold. Was greeted by Angie at front desk. Average looking young lady with big smile though and started laying on the over the top sales talk to get me in a room. Was told it was $45 1/2 for massage. Thought WTF give it a go so booked and paid an was shown to a room and told to get undressed and she would be back soon. Room was absolutely fucking freezing - only turned on the small fan heater on the floor when I went in. Old building with high ceilings. I felt like getting the hell out of there as it was just not inviting at all but as I stood in front of the heater (still with my clothes on), I started to defrost and thought I would push on. Got the gear off, kept jocks on and stood in front of the heater until Angie came back and she apologised about the temperature and I said no problem stripped off totally and lay on the table face down..had the hole for head which is always good, towels nice and clean so all good. Angie asked what type of massage and I said firm and she started giving me a pretty good firm massage but kept asking me all the time "is it good, do you feel good" every 2 minutes which was annoying after a while..I like to chill a bit while I get a massage not have the same questions asked over and over...if it's no good or whatever I will say so. So this continued for more than 15 minutes as she kept asking me questions..what do I do, where did I find them, am I enjoying it yap, yap yap in a kind of really fake accent. No brushes past the tackle at all so thought this is going nowhere then out of the blue asks me if I want extras and I said "what are you offering" and she said HJ $30, Nude extra $20...whoah!. I said what about a BJ she said no does not do that. I offered $20 for HJ (against my better judgement) and she accepted so turned over and she started massaging chest and legs then moved pretty quickly to the old fella. I tried to  lower the top of her blouse to get to her breasts but she quickly pulled away and put a stop to that and said touching only on the outside. Had thickish bra on, no excitement there so went under the skirt. felt like she had her mums undies on so no joy there also. She got me across the line (just) very clinical and business like, cleaned me up with a warm towel and I was on my way. Overall pretty average experience and would not return to see Angie.

My experience/comments :  Gilbert Rd Preston. I was driving past on Thursday and saw a beautiful dark girl ringing the door bell to get in. I promptly rearranged my schedule and returned. The girls name is Chloe and she is a dark skinned South African girl who has been in Australia since a child. Now aged in early twenties.
Massage cost was $40 and I have her $50. No change was offered.

the massage was reasonably good. She remained fully clothed. At one stage when she was at the head of the table, I did try to rub her bottom and she immediately stepped back and says that she never let's anyone touch her. Oh we'll so be it. Enjoy the massage.

On the flip she started to nudge the old fella so I asked her if she did any extras and she straight out told me$30 for HJ and $50 to take her top off. $30 was all I had so I went with the HJ only and I thought $50 for topless was steep. 


Reasonable HJ. But doubt if I will return

Question for you Mick. When you paid for the tug I assume after the massage was complete did you volunteer her the $20 as she owed you change or were you compelled to hand over the $30 meaning that what should have been a $70 30 min rub n tug was now an $80 ripoff? If this is the case then there is a better than greater chance she won't survive for long and will disappear as fast as she appeared!

One thing if she can't count. Another if she can't massage! IMHO she looks as if she cannot do either from this review!

Actually Fart what happens is Holliday Calm usually employs someone to troll through Gumtree and report most other massage establishments that are offering illegal services in Melbourne. They also report a number of PMl's if they suspect they might be taking business away from them. This is fairly standard now. A mod (CSO) from Gumtree informs me they have clout because they pay to advertise and when they report the response is usually swift and they remove the ad. 

This is part of the nasty portion of the competition. It is far from healthy. The ads that display an ABN are usually exempt from these actions and certainly the ads that are paid are exempt from these whingers. 

So the ads are being removed quickly unless there are too many posted in which case some get through unscathed and end up remaining but of course go through to pages further down the posts pages and require searching. 

With Gumtree a hint is not to sign in and add ads to your watch-list. Cookies will usually hold them in your watch-list or you can register and maintain ads into your logged in watch-list! The list of posting guidelines are many for the massage classification. Those ads that do not display the disclaimer "No sexual service" or include any pictures are usually edited or removed. 

Hope this info was helpful.

Yep, I'm guessing the phone number is still active. But the building is gutted and the old massage posters that were on the windows are gone, replaced with a 'for lease/sale' sign

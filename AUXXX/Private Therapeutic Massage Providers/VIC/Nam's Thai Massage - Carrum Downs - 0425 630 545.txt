I think I went there earlier this year.She works from a back room at her home and there is a big sign on the front of the house saying "Thai Massage" or something similar so you can't miss the place.She is an absolute stunner (mid-late 20s,taller than most Thai girls and she had on a pair of short shorts which showed off a great pair of legs) the massage was very good but no hint of extras.I could also hear other family members in the house.I can't remember the price.

I actually don't think she's a ladyboy, but is definitely NOT a stunner as the poster above described her!

 Jade - Dandenong - 0452 441 400

Jade is back. Never saw her before was going to make an app with her at her old apartment St Kilda Rd but she closed last year.
She used to advertise that she would do a massage 24/7 over the weekends. She must have kept all the mobile numbers that enquired before as she sms'd me that she is now in Dandenong and available again. Here is an old review:

Jade, American Beaut from St Kilda Street   							Week or so ago I have responded to this massage advertisement in  gumtree. Girl replied me promptly quoting $100 for 90 minutes and asking  my contact details. So I have given my mobile number. She had tried to  contact me promptly; actually she left few voice mails and sms. So I  have called her back and made an appointment for Friday night 9pm to  10.30pm (she was busy until 9pm).  By the way she had a very sexy accent  and voice of a teenager.
So went to her apartment in St Kilda Rd (5X2), I was on time sharp 9pm I  had to wait outside for 10minutes, then she came and met me at  downstairs near the lift. She is very polite, soft spoken, very cute  lady.  Initially I thought she is Fijian or so, turned out to be she is  from Penn. 
Her apartment was tiny somewhere close to 10th floor or so.  Room was  dark not lights were switched off and few candles were burning. She gave  me a little induction, she showed me some customer information sheets  and “if you like you can fill these, but many don’t” so I didn’t.  Also  showed the massage table and “if you want to take your underwear off, I  have towel to cover you” after that she went to corner of her tiny  apartment sat on a chair can hide her face between legs. So I have  changed and she started the massage.
Massage was very average quality, soft touch, she try her best to avoid  my lil man and his surroundings. Last 15 minutes after the turn over I  ask her for extras… she nod her head very shyly and said sorry.  ‘oh  what a disappointment!’.  She was very quite during the massage. After  she finishes she went to her chair and back to cover her face position.
Its looks like there should be extras the way she answered the phone timing and atmosphere.  Maybe on second visit?

Does anyone here have experience with her? Any extras? 

Massage:  5/10
Looks: 9/10 (pretty face, good figure, around 170cm, C/D cup)
Attitude: 9.5/10




Might be just a regular massage but will book and report back with contact details etc. Has  anyone sampled her before?

$70 hr  for pleasant massage from pleasant lady.
Very holiday calm type experience where it appears that
extras should be on offer but frustratingly not. No point posting
her details. If you are curious pm me.

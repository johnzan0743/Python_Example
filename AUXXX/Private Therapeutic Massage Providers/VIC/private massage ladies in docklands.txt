The reviews for this establishment http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f120/k...1-737-a-11250/ are a bit old,  so please post a review if you choose them (although the LetsGetSome post doesn't sound encouraging).

Good luck on Locanto. Half of the massage ads are for m2m, http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/Mass...klands&dist=15

Here's Jess's ad, http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_2...XY-AUSSIE.html

No reviews that I can find, so please post if you TOFFT

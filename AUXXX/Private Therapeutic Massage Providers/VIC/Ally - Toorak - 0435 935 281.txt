Persons name : Ally

Establishment : private apapartment

Contact: 0435 935 281

Date: 22/04/15

Address : toorak

Hours of business : unsure

Rates : $250

Age : 25ish

Size : slim perky breasts

Nationality : Aussie 

Services : massage, HJ

Value for money/recommended : Not for $250 per hour


I saw ally's ad on gumtree and called her, I was a bit unsure after hearing her rates but she managed to turn me around!! 

she was very friendly over the phone and agreed to meet with in the next 30mnts, once I arrived at the apartment I was very quiet happy with what I saw, she was wearing leggings and a tank top and she has a nice size 10 curvy body.

in to the massage room and she asked me if I wanted to have a shower and I said that will be good, after the shower I came back to the room and she was waiting for me there with nothing on. 

the massage started with me on my tummy and it wasn't hard to tell that she has had some training, for the first 15mnts she did the top half of my back and then to the bottom, even though she advertises as lomi lomi it wasn't really a lomi lomi. it was just a relaxation massage. don't get me wrong, it was still a nice relaxing massage with not much sensual touch to it,

then she got me to roll over and started to massage my front. she knew how to tease mini me but her HJ technique was a bit jackhammerish. she does have a great curvy body which I was allowed to touch her soft silky body but she kept moving away every time my hand got closer to her shaved pussy cat!!

it was a nice enough experience, but I don't think it worths more that $150 for the hour and I won't be going back

Is it just me or is there a disturbingly high number of MLs asking these kinds of rates for B2B in Melb these days? It is dangerously close to becoming the norm in the CBD from what I see on Locanto

Correct. 
Products can only sell if they are at correct market prices. 
Yes some can afford and will pay $25 a kilo for melons, but if only 1 person buys them they will go broke coz ppl will go elsewhere and get their fruit down the road for $10 a kilo. As this is a fair price. 
I think in general guys, if we think there is a fair rate we should stick to it and only offer to pay that. The WL will get conditioned to charge that way when they end up with no customers. 

Then if u personally feel the service of a particular standard, thats up to u to tip accordingly.

Hi Gents,

I saw the advertisement on Locanto, seems like she's got training on messaging.
There's a mild sensual option as well for $170 p/h.

Anyone with ideas?

tnx

What exactly is the point of your post rinudesilva? "Anyone with ideas?" What are you asking for? Ideas about what? Perhaps post a few reviews first too.

Yes I have ideas. 

1) mild sensual is softer than hard sensual
2) mild sensual is harder than soft sensual
3) mild sensual is more sensual than non sensual
4) mild sensual is optional ie don't take it if you don't want it. 

Does that help?

We have all done it and that's why its called a punt. 
I don't know why you would think about the hygiene factor as its probably better than some brothels. 
Once you go we will hopefully all have the benefit of your review since she hasn't been reviewed since April. 
If it's your first punt good luck.

Yes i saw Ally in late June -

I found her to be quite elegant yet you right about the lomi lomi - definetly more of a sensual relaxation..
Her hj was was firm and i came pretty quickly - i think she wanted me too..
oh yes and silkiest skin i have felt in a long time! this woman glows a with a healthy radiance...

if im in the area and no one else to see - ill definetly give her ago again - think she might be one of those types that you have to spend a little extra cash and time to get to know her before she opens up for more interaction.

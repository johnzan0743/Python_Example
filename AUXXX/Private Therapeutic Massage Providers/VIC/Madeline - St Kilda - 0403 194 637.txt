Gave Madeline a try last minute. Sent text and got prompt reply. Easy to organise and I was there within the hour. Buzzed in to appt building no probs. She is really nice and friendly/welcoming. Accepted the shower and took care of finances, at $200 for 45mins Only option is a double bed which I'm not a fan of as I get a stiff neck lying face down/head to the side. It's a really nice nurturing massage with a bit of the tantric breathing if you want to go down that road. I went for the PM which commenced after about 10 mins with me on my back. This actually lasted till the end which made for a great pm/HJ finish.  It's reallly nice to get that sort of service from someone that is present, engaged and enjoys doing it. I know the rates are getting up there but she's a good sort that really enjoys her work. Only downer was the room was freezing. I'll be back in summer! I'll also ad that she looks much better than her photos.

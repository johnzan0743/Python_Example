[COLOR="red"]*I have removed the phone number since we have been told that it is no longer associated with Annu. If anyone has a new number please post and it can get included in the thread details#[/COLOR]
Advertises in Locanto as Prahan, Camberwell young massage girl, claiming to be 22. Emailed through Locanto, received number asked for photos which she will not provide but claims to be 22, Chinese and slim. Reluctant to drive there and find yet another heavy weight fake, can someone confirm. Place is Waverly Rd malvern east.

She operates out of the rooms above the *address details removed given the doubt over the contact number*  Malvern East.
Don't confuse her with the Thai Massage that just opened in the same premises
( they are shit, ave massage and no tug). She charges $70 an hour for a reasonable massage
but a bit expensive for my stingy arse is the $30 for HJ and
another $30 for nude! Yes she is gorgeous. Long hair down to her lower back. Small and petite
with nice small, firm tits. Size 6 yes. Probably Eurasian or  Australian born Asian as she doesn't
have much of an accent. Bit chatty too, if that's you're thing.

Hi Pacificbrown, thx for the great feedback, I will be sure to provide feedback of my experience. At least I know I am not going to get another lady pretending to be slim.

You can enter through a gate in the wooden fence on Burke Rd ( opposite the servo)
If you go in to the hairdresser you might cop the Thai massage 
( $45 per hour) which is good value but there's no HJ

Visited Ann & yes she is chatty, very friendly girl, really attractive face, slim girl but when I asked for nude massage she said she doesn't do, so I am lying there in my birthday suit thinking WTF. Anyway there was lots of brushing past the sack etc, I asked for the HJ no probs there. Damage $105 one hour.

She's changed, definately did the nude previously.
Maybe the new fellow tenants ( Thai massage) are keeping an eye
on her.

I did notice that when I recieved the email reply from Hanna on Locanto
that her email address started with annu, maybe Anne's running a couple of
places/ girls? This place is in Lexton St Box Hill. If Anne had been here I would have
picked her for sure, she's a fine young thing.

Visited Collingwood premises recently and strange setup as shares premises with another massage business who man the reception area.
Made appointment via text and when got there pretty girl called Lisa says she will do as Annu not around/on holidays (sorry her English poor). Knew I was in trouble when she turned down lights, lit candles, put on the relaxing music and then towel over my naked bum. She was fully clothed at all times.
Massage was very good but 100% legit with no touching anywhere near my privates. She acted all dumb when I pressed her on extras. Cost was $50 and don't like chance of getting anything other than good massage from Lisa.

Value for money/recommend? OK, Got details from Gumtree add. Pretty girl, mid 20's, says she is on tour around Australia and going home soon. Nude massage in hotel room with HJ finish, paid for an hour, all over in 30 mins and gone. Very mechanical and did not really enjoy it. BE CAREFUL, keeps sending texts days after offering services. Not a good thing!.

Sorry, The first number should not be there, Was trying to do a review on Shindu at the same time, went to see her as well. Definitely the second number.

Lisa is not a independent operator. Works for a guy who drives her around. Has a lot of ads on gumtree and locanto.

I have seen a Belgian girl a while back who was on same number. The service was shit and she was not pretty and I actually pushed her out in 20 mins (in a half hr booking) without doing a HJ. 

Seems this guy hires desperate backpackers who have run out of cash and drives them to appointments. How I found out was that due to my living setup I asked her to meet me at the driveway and she refused and said only way is if she can knock on the door... bizarre but i agreed. Later that girl told me she works for this guy and he is driving her around but he doesn't want to be seen.

I agree the_enigma, I think this guy has a few numbers. Another one is Yumi on 0478 826 081. This one seemed to be a very similar experience, same type of return messages and instructions. Also found on Gumtree. The girl was small asian, actually quick nice. We maybe should get all the numbers listed and avoid this one.

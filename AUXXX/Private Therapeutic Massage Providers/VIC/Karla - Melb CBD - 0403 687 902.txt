Hours of Business : 12pm - 7pm

Rates : 60mins / 100

Age : 25..ish

Size/shape : 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian

Services Provided : Massage, Hand job, B2B

Value for money/recommend? : Reasonable

My experience/comments : Saw the ad on cracker and liked the photo so I thought I would give it a try.
Karla doesn't openly state she does any extras during as or booking time.
Made a booking and she is in the heart of the city so parking not great.
Was buzzed into apartment and was pleasantly surprised as she is pretty attractive, not glamour attractive but certainly has something about her.
Massage starts and she enquires as to what type of massage I wanted and I said lomi that was quite sensual.
At this point she asks if I'm after any extras.
Menu is $50 for hand relief, $100 for nude, and $150 for B2B.
Given I had already paid $100 for massage I settled on the $50 for hand job.
Massage was reasonable on the back, nothing too sensual and nothing to amazing.
On the flip she went straight for the cock and loved to make noise whist she was stroking me like she really was enjoying it.
At times I tried to touch her but she was not open to it unless I paid her more money.
She worked me for 15 minutes until I exploded, and then gave me a face massage and wipe down before I left.
Overall just ok service, although I think the body to body whilst being expensive could be fun and I could push some boundaries with her.

My experience/comments : Saw the ad on this forum and thought i would have a crack. Similar to the previous review, she does not offer extras over the phone
Made a booking over the phone and everything ran smoothly. Its great that she is in the city as well
was buzzed in, introduced myself and exchanged the funds. During this exchange, she offered extras ie  $50 for hj , $100 for nude, and $150 for the delux package ie body to body etc.
i asked for the hand relief cos due to lack of funds ( i will remember next time :P)
Massage was ok, used her elbows, warm hand, flicked over my balls a few times and whispered sweet somethings in my ear.
Ask me to flip over and gave an above average hj. I was fondling that pretty ass whilst i was getting stroked. 
She was breathing heavy whilst she was tugging me off so i am hoping she enjoyed it as well but who knows. 
I blew my load, had a quick shower and left.I would go back

Wow,  

I have been caught about before in Sydney with really expensive massages that promised the world and delivered very little, but very disheartened to hear of these prices in Melbourne.

Guys, thanks for TOFTT and posting the results, our efforts are greatly appreciated.

Value for money/recommend? : Ok - can get expensive

Ok - after reading this thread I decided to give her a go.  Massage was above average - I won't say great but for sure it is better than many of the oil swirlers out there.  On the flip she went straight for a very nice HJ.  I think she really enjoys it and much more could be had although it could get very expensive.

I would have thought $150 for one hour with HJ is not bad value.  Was she nude?

Many thanks guys.

I was turned off by the insistent no sex no extras etc. in her ads.

Her ads look like a copy of BP ads for  Amber/Fitzroy, which insists no extras, qualified therapist etc.  I have read that she won't budge these days.

So I thought Karla's ads. gave off the same vibe. I must get cashed up & give her a burl. She has such a straight wholesome look about her (same as Amber has), I would find that to be a real turn on, knowing that more is on offer.

Very valuable intel. I will do review after I see her.

Person's Name : Karla

Establishment : Private apartment

Date of Visit : July 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Relax with Qualified AUSSIE MASSEUSE Karla in the CBD  - Melbourne therapeutic massage - cracker.com.au

Hours of Business : 10am onwards

Rates : $100/hour + $50 each extra

Age : mid 25s

Size/shape : Size 8, she can be described as lithe

Nationality or Ethnicity : Caucasian

Services Provided : Nude massage, B2B, HR, CBJ

Value for money/recommend? : It was ok but with the extras starts to get expensive

My experience/comments : 
Now first tried contacting Karla by sms and not getting a response from her so tried calling and going direct to voicemail.  After a couple of days was about to give up when she replied by text and was able to lock in a booking.  I arrived to the location about 5 minutes early by the directions in the sms and attempted to call her as directed.  She let it ring out and I ended up walking around as it seemed less suss that standing in the one spot.  Called her again on the dot and she replied and gave directions to her apartment building and buzzed me up.  Met at the door and lead to a plain room with a double bed, side table and portable heater.  I pay her for the hour and she leaves me to undress and lay on the towel on the bed.  She returns and begins quite a good firm massage.  After 15 minutes she offers extras of HR, nude, touching and B2B.  I opted for all and she then offers CBJ.  Unfortunately I was out of cash at that point so couldn't take that up.  She stripped out of her leggings and tank top showing a slim body with a neat trimmed patch over her mound continued with the massage and transitioning to B2B. I found the B2B rubbish as it didn't really do it for me.  Once I flipped her B2B was carried out with her at an angle to my body.  Imagine I was laying from 12 to 6, she would have been at 10 to 4.  From the way she was positioned, I could only really touch her with one hand.  From there she began a slow tug first with one hand and then the other until she coaxed out a decent load.  Although her tug was quite good, she does stop straight after you let rip where I like for them to keep tugging away.  From there She cleaned up my mess then showed me to a shower.  After the shower, I paid her for the extras and left to continue my day.

WIR - Maybe once more though I'll skip the B2B next time and maybe see what her CBJ is like.  With the price of her extras it starts to get up there though and I'm sure more could be found elsewhere at a more competitive price.

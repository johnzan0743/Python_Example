I thought I'd slip off to try these guys as their promise of "a sensual LOMI LOMI for gentlemen" looked like it was going to deliver the goods as a Punt.....wrong.

Nice street in Elwood on the top floor of a residential block which looked classic RnT. As soon as I walked in and saw the very professional set-up, I realised that despite the enticing advert there was more chance of me winning Tatts this week than getting a tug

No don't get me wrong, this massage was sensational, long flowing Lomi Lomi stokes properly done in balance, fantastic. Chrystal was very professional and cute, a little small talk, but unfortunately mainly focussed on the job in hand rather than a hand job!

As I realised we were coming to the end I made a couple of appreciative sighs but to no avail. Towelled down and out the door.

WIR-

To make sure no-one else makes the same mistake as me I thought I'd post this to give you all the heads up that this place is strictly legit (though god I wish it wasn't). I'd love to say yes I would return....but even for a straight massage it's a bit on the high site...especially when  you can't get an itch scratched!

Now one last thing....I felt it was soooo legit that I didn't even bother to ask after my appreciative come-on sighs came to nothing and the fact she went no-where near the old boy but if it looks like a duck.....anyway would love to be proved wrong but think it may be a cold day in hell!

Thanks for the confirmation. Yes the ads are very missleading.
Obviously women and men have different ideas
about 'sensual '

Contacted them as well the other day, thinking the ad had all the cues and undertones that something a little more might be on offer.

I could tell though from the subsequent text message exchange that it was all going to be pretty straight so declined.

These girls must be the masters of marketing or have taken a leaf out of the book of the lomi lomi chicks in Caulfield! 
They are now using at least 2 sets of names that I can see and are now doing lingerie massage! Sooooooo once again I contacted them and apparently there are still no extras......jeez there are going to be alot of blue balls leaving that apartment ! If anyone can prove me wrong I would be a very very happy man

Value for money/recommend? : Not in my opinion

I wish I read this thread first!  The massage was fine, but the apartment was freezing cold leaving me with two types of blue balls hehe.  She even pressed her chest into my face when I was facing up but no chance of anything happening, the advertising is very misleading.

I would not return.

Resisted and finally went along after seeing an ad on Craigslist that didn't include 'non sexual service'. 
Even went one level up from the lingerie to the topless sarong massage. 
She had a g-string underneath. 
Cut young slim half-Fijian girl though. Quite a turn on. 
Still got nothing - even offering $100 if she would just get naked and I'll sort myself out... No go!
Forget about it.

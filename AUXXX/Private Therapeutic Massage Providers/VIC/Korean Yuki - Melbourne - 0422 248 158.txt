Thursday, 5 April

Earlier today I had my crack and tackle ravaged by a MILF from Seoul. My cock and balls felt like they'd fought the Korean war ... single-handed.

But the week had started out bad.

My regular Thai cock-puller has got herself a boyfriend. She tells me this while she's throbbing my pole, black gym tights down around her ankles, my fingers working hard between her legs, inside her panties, a couple of knuckles deep in her pulsating sausage holster.

Funny thing was, she wouldn't let me take her panties off. She didn't mind me fingering her poontang stupid but I wasn't allowed to eye the gash (although I've seen her shaved clam quite a few times in the past). Maybe Sugar Daddy told her he didn't want anyone copping an eyeful of her cooter - but he forgot to say anything about touching. That must be it ... because while I was doing some two-finger beaver-boxing the biatch was at my ramrod, busier than that goose Abbott trying to stir up trouble. In fact, she was more fired-up than any hare-brained, coal-fired power station Tony could ever dream of.

Anyhow, she can go get fucked.

Today I've managed to give the boss the slip and gone AWOL, looking to get my spring-roll pleasured. After what felt like a mini-tour of Melbourne, I ended up walking into this dive of a joint not too far from where Lea got ripped. Fuck me, the first thing I notice when I walk in is this awful fuckin' stench like someone had cooked cabbage, or worse, cooked cabbage, ate it and farted. The place is dark and dingy. 

Anyhows, after about 2 fuckin' hours an old mamasan schlocks out from behind a filthy fuckin' curtain and asks: "Wathyu wan?" 

"Aw, I dunno, maybe a serve of Steamy Meat Curtains with Extra Fish Sauce. You got any Oysters, Chinese Style?"

"Ahh, nice girls for yu. Bee-u-tiful girl."

An aged PRC granny steps out from the shadows, gives me a toothy grin and tries to take my hand. Now I don't want to be needlessly unkind but this chick put the 'fug' into 'fugly' (if you know what I mean). I understand she's someone's mother but she's so bad-looking she'd have to sneak up on a mirror. 

I hesitate, sweating to find an excuse to exit, while retaining at least some dignity. The mamasan is watching me like a hawk. She's a sharp old bitch and she knows what I'm thinking. She starts the hard sell:

"Yu go with this girl. She bee-u-tiful. She do velly good job".

"Er, um, I, er ... ".

"Yu go with this girl. YU GO NOW!".

She gets more and more insistent. I'm probably the first client they've had in 3 weeks. Fuck me, if I go behind that curtain I may never come back out.
Look, if she hadn't started shouting, bullying and trying on the old Kung Fu Hustle I might have stayed. Time was running out and my booganfloogel desperately needed a Shanghai handshake. I guess I'd have just closed my eyes and thought of Wendi Deng.

But, frankly, I became seriously pissed with her CCP (Chinese Communist Party) tactics - you do what we say! you think what we want you to think! 

No way, Madame bloody Mao!

I get my hand on the door handle and, as I open it, I give her a healthy serve of good ol' Aussie free speech:

"I do not intend to stay with this lady. Tibet and Taiwan are not part of China! The PRC does not have exclusive rights to the South China Sea ... I admit Pandas are cute but they're fat, lazy, useless pricks!"

I skedaddle back to my car and get the fuck outta there. I'm feeling a bit like Cory Bernardi. I've fucked off but now I got nowhere to go.

Anyhows, duty called. I was meeting the boss in the city a bit later for a consult so I figured I'd swing past there a little early and see what's on offer. After all, it was the playground of the infamous 'Fatty' Doyle so there must be some action happening somewhere.

I grab my trusty mobile and check a well-known website that has an adult section containing different subcategories of various sex work professionals (such as escorts, erotic masseuses, strippers, phone sex operators, etc.). I believe this highly respected site is intensely studied across the nation, in boardrooms, private school senior classes, in the highest political circles and by tradies, always at the back of their respective rooms, lecture theatres, parliaments and utes of course.

My interest (and my cock) were aroused by an ad. for a "New Sexy Japanese - Come and enjoy my magical touch and let me take all your stress away. I will give u very good time babe". Wow, she's advertising in an open and unashamed manner that she's Japanese - must be genuine 

A couple of text messages got me to a busy street in the heart of our big, seething fuckopolis, into an elevator and out into a corridor where I meet a dodgy-looking, middle-aged Asiatic dude approaching me. He looked a lot like that sleazy little cunt, Joel Cairo. Either he'd just fucked somebody, had his cock sucked or he was the local 'Willie The Pimp'. His mouth was twisted in a sly smile (or maybe a sneer). He stepped aside to let me pass, his beady eyes never leaving me. I not sure if he was coveting my brass or my arse. This jerkoff gave me the creeps.

The joint turns out to be one of those matchboxes that parade as 2 bedroom apartments in the CBD, but the second bedroom is a small curtained section of the living room.

Anyhows, amazing - the chick that opens the door is surprisingly (IMO) attractive. Nice face, clear skin, shoulder length hair, tallish, svelte figure draped in a slinky white dress that shows off her graceful figure and just enough thigh to make my tossil thicken slightly. Her tits aren't anything to write home to your Mum about but that doesn't worry me. I'd say she's probably in her early thirties.

Her name's Yuki.

She's welcoming and friendly, inviting me into the main bedroom where she asks me to undress. I can pay later. She ducks out for a moment while I lay down on the massage table, carefully arranging the awakening dragon so it sticks out between my legs with my nutsac bulging above it.

She returns, stripping to reveal a slender and, for me, very enticing beach bod and cute ass. Oh, and a very inviting, shaved oyster. She starts a pretty novice massage, trying to imitate all the normal massage moves but without the confidence or the firmness of a pro. Doesn't matter, I'm too busy to give a fuck - engaged as I am in some pretty damn smooth conversation designed to break the ice, gain her trust ... and open her legs.

About 20 minutes into the session she slips onto the table, between my legs, and starts a more sensuous touch which leads her probing fingers down around my balls, my crocosaurus and some light crack work. Magic. She oils up her chest and starts the body slide. Crocosaurus instantly morphs into Cockzilla, which is fuckin' uncomfortable because it's trying to burst out from under me but can't quite shift my weight to gain its freedom. By now the lizard is engorged and my knob is like a gigantic blueberry. If she sucks on that she's gonna get a full week's worth of antioxidants and Vitamin C (not to mention a dislocated jaw), all washed down with a pint of cream.

She must have noticed cause she asks if I'd like to I turn over. You kidding? Does the iron-man have a rusty cock? No worries. Now, my usual trick at this stage at a wank-shop is to start a conversation about some shit to take my mind off the job and extend the amount of time she spends handling my cock. I also like the shock value. You should see the reactions I get, the look on a face when they are fapping away and I start laying into Trump, chatting about MKR (do you reckon Pete and Manu are an item?) or discussing the Schwarzschild radius - whatever that is (I just wing it, nobody knows what it is anyway, except Stephen Hawking and he's left the planet).

On this occassion I only last a few minutes before I cover her fingers with custard. At one point I tried to go the two-finger shuffle but, too bad, her secret garden was off limits. Still, she performed a great, leisurely handjob with plenty of attention to my shaft and codberries. I came like a geyser. There's nut-butter all up her arm.

As I stumble down the corridor to the shower I'm still spurting goo from my rod (I hope she's got some sandals). On my way I take a glance into the loungeroom at the end of the hall. There's another Asian chick lying on a bed texting. I can't get a good gander at her but I'm already thinking there might be a chance for a threesome some time in the future.

Anyhow, I'm out of there. I'm late for my rendezvous with the big boy. When I get there he wants to know why I'm late. I give him some chat about the potential of the Korean market and how we should explore its possibilities. He decides he'd like a nice bit of Korean seafood, maybe oysters, so we head off to taste a Korean - I mean, to sample the tastes of Korea. He wants to know why my face is flushed.

************

So, to recap, just so there's no confusion:-

Firstly, I double-checked her name:

"Your name's Yuki?"
"Yes, Yuki."
"Y-U-K-I?"
"Yes."
"Any other Yukis work here?"
"No."

Secondly, her nationality:

"So, you are from Japan?"
"No, from Seoul, in Korea."

The rates:

So, I paid $120- for the 1 hour. Nude massage with cock, ball and a little crack play, a Henry James and a body
slide.
No FIV, no kissing, no sucking tits, FS or DATY and no BJ. 
The joint is clean and a shower and a fresh towel are available. All big pluses in my book. The only thing missing
was the 'Trivago' chick.

I enjoyed it and I'll be back to see the MILF from  Seoul.

My experience/comments : 

Was looking for someone around southern cross and came across her ad in locanto. What more she confirmed she can do a firm massage. Great! Last minute booking and off I went to her unit. Security block with reception but they were busy with short stay guests. Went straight up to her unit and she was wearing a dress to open the door. Not WOW but she's ok looking. It's her photos 100% in the ad. Discussed financials, paid, stripped off and on to the massage table in the room. She stripped completely naked for the massage which was firm-ish. Her English was ok too but wasn't much of a chatter so I kept quiet after a while. Some accidental touches while on my front which built up into a turnover please. Decent body with nice supple B cups although she didn't seem to like to be touched too much. Onto body slide which was mechanical, not much eye contact. Got me rock hard still and she tugged till I finished. No finesse there just pure tugging action. Wiped me down and off to shower because she used heaps of oil for the slides. Said thank you and off I went. Ok experience.

As our ol mate Foreman used to say, the brothel is still the best value, even with the extra's that are sneaking in there, you can always say no to them. For money longevity it really is the only way.

There has been a mass of these private apartment reviews lately on here, more than at anytime i can remember.

Its been closed up for maybe 6 months i think. They then moved into Scanlan St off South Rd. I think the council then shut that down about a month ago.

Unfortunately No! She operated massage parlour at Scanlan St for a while! Since then, Never heard  anything about Mamasan. I cannot understand why she run the service at a shop where was raid by police last year!

The review thread for this establishment probably also deals with its closing, http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f143/9...50/index8.html

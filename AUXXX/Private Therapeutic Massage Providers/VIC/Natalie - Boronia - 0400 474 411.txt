I texted her last year and used my punting name at the time.
Never ended up making an appt. Saw a more recent add and with the promise of a spa
and the pics were a bit better so texted again using my new punting name
and she was very miffed with my change of names ( a year apart from contacts)
and bit of attitude so I left it there.

this lady is very picky with her clients, i chatted with her about her services and prices for a lengthy period via text and she seemed so lovely, then when i made the appointment and told her my age as i was about to leave for her place, she basically told me to sod off! She only sees ppl over a certain age limit. I told her WTF? You should make that clear in your ad! I asked her what would have happened if i rocked up at her place for the appointment and then she saw me being so young and she replied with 'I have security cameras and 2 steel protected security gates that i use to keep ppl like you away!' I couldn't believe how cold she became from just learning my age. Weird woman, and she holds on to your contact details FOREVER so she knows if you contact her again.  All this happened 2 years ago, and i messaged this number last week not realising it was the same woman asking for an appointment and she replies with the same cold messages again telling me to get lost. Guys under 40 stay away, but the older gents, you are probs in for a great and unique service. Her spa treatment sounded amazing, but be wary of her strange mood swings

She has tickets on herself. 

Way too expensive for someone old and fat.

Her service is way too expensive. She's over 50s and it's a service that I wouldn't pay more than $100 per hour

yankee, you have only two Reviews using the Template and after that some comments and now you talk about a provider you have not formally Reviewed.

In case you are unaware the Review Template can be found in the "Quick Reply" section on the Formatting line at the top right hand side. See at the end of the line there is a dropdown menu titled Templates.

Looking forward to receiving your reviews.

Person's Name : Natalie

Establishment : Bayswater, VIC

Date of Visit : February 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business : 0400474411

Rates : $250 /h

Age : 50s

Size/shape : Busty 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie

Services Provided : Massage, slides + HJ

Value for money/recommend? :  I don't think so

My experience/comments : 

Found Natalie in a locanto ad. She puts pictures of herself in the ad (they are accurate). Trying to arrange a booking with her is not that easy; since you need to book her with days in advance (she only takes a few bookings per week).
Once I texted her the first time, she sent me a very long generic text back with all the options available. The options include a massage with hand relief for $200, outdoor spa with massage and hj for $250, hj and anal play with toy for $250 and a handcuff massage with hj for $250. No oral, no anal on her, no full service and no 30 minutes booking available.

I thought all her offers were very expensive, but since she lives in the same suburb as I do, I decided to give a try and booked the outdoor spa session for 1 hour. She texted the address the same day of the booking, so I went on my way.
Natalie I think she is on her 50s, busty (not natural) blonde. Went to the shower first and then spent like 30 minutes in the spa chatting and her hands all over my body. After that we went inside to one of the rooms and the massage started, applied oil, body slides and then went for the flip. More oil applied and some tit-fuck until I came.

WIR? Probably not, since it is not worth the value for money. But I did really enjoy my time with her.

This is not a review just a warning.

Found this blond bitch in Locanto claiming Silkentouch sensual massage Boronia - sexy, Aussie lady 42 year old, Claims she is 65kg (add 15kg) ph 0400 474 411.

After swapping a few text she offers basically kinky outfits, prostate, Rnt, boob wank etc. Asked what Nationality I am (one of those, but I passed her racist test). When I asked did she do nude she said "read my (long) sms" then said No. 

I then complimented her but respectfully declined. She then sent a rude SMS about how great her body was (bullshit) and she just prefers not to show it to the "types that use my service"

What a rude bitch......suggest you all avoid. She charges between $250 - $350 per hr, no FS, no anal, no oral. Dreamer.

Interesting to read all of these posts as it seems none of the posters has actually seen Natalie. I saw her just over two years ago and it was a most enjoyable though not inexpensive experience. I think she had only been operating for a short while then and when I phoned she answered saying that she was out but could not talk but would send me a text with details of her services. The text arrived a few moments later and the services went from a clother massage up to FS and everything in between. As I hadn't seen her before I elected to go for the mid range rub me up rub you down service. Shared mutual massage with hand relief at $200 for the hour. She said she had a cancellation so I was there an hour later. I found this was atopless service so for another $20 she did the service nude. I think her claimed early 40's age as about right. A bit plump perhaps but looks much better in the flesh than in her photos. Started with some very nice DFK and mutual touching. I began to gently massage her clit and after five minutes or so she had what I believed to be a real orgasm. Her body is quite firm and her breasts large and very firm, so much so that I assumed she had implants but I could not see the usual surgical scars or feel implants. We spent most of the time masaging and body sliding with lots of (water based) oil. She probably spent 15 minutes on the HJ meaning that she took her time to give maximum satisfaction with no rush. Very high quality premises and towels etc. were five star hotel standard. 

Was it worth it? For the same money I could get three 30 minute AMP nude massages or two  30 minuteFS sessions. It was however a great experience with a friendly sexy chatty lady. Being reasonably mature I enjoy visits to attractive older ladies. You tend to remember the experience long after you have forgotten the price.

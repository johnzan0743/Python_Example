Age:says 24 , looks about right

Size/shape:Size 8

Nationality or Ethnicity:Not Sure

Services Provided:topless soft massage with singing 

Value for money/recommend?: NO WAY

My experience/comments: 

Seeing reikas details on cracker.com.au i thought i would give her a try. she sounded hot on the phone (intentionally putting that hot croak and giggle in voice lol) so thought what the i'll take a punt and another one for the team. plus was interested to hear her singing as she was topless. and if a tug was included while she was singing - wow lol

arrived at her place in franston which is about 50 mins drive from the city of melb. arrived at a hippy looking house and greeted by a young looking women. she doesn't look as good as her photos but decent enough and pretty accurate in photos. in i went. she reminded me of the session - 160 for singing and a massage with her topless. and no hand relief she added. damn i thought, but I still had hope lol. well i came all this way so far i thought what the hell - donation of 160 given

stripped down and onto the table. reika then lit some insense which grew very strong and stunk my clothes and skin out lol. so be ware if you dont want to smell like some hippy bonfire. her massage on my back started with some feather like softness on my back before removing the sarong like thing she put on my back. very average. she said a few weird prayer things and then did some light / medium massage work on my legs back and butt. no tackle touching, no even close. not very interesting at all. before she asked me to roll over she did some prayer thing and rubbed her tits on my back - i was also praying, no doubt we were praying for different things  

on to the flip, she had a good peek at my boner over the towel she was holding before placed it over me. then did some pushing thing on my legs, and hips and stomach. then massaged my face and eyes for about 15 mins  ( wtf). by now my member was severly disinterested, even looking at her okay looking young tits was getting annoying lol as i sensed the session coming to an end. she didnt do any sensual work anywhere near my cock, inner thighs, or anything. finished the eye massage then got some prayer bowl, banged it a bit and did some further rambling of prayer about purity, greatness and goodness as her tits dangled freely. then said the session was over and that she hoped I was very relaxed now. she then left the room

i dressed, drank my refilled glass of water, took her pack of matches for my ciggy afterwards (to get the most of my $160!) and left. 

So, in conclusion, this experience for me was the worse punt imaginable. i would not recommend to anyone. perhaps there is more on offer for others but i felt totally screwed . worse than tantra - atleast you get a tug lol

also, i realised after i left that she didn't even sing and chant.  WTF

i felt completely screwed! avoid like the plague - thogh would be good to hear if anyone else has had similar or other experiences with this one. maybe she just didnt like me

There is so many girls just ripping us punters of our hard earned and not giving the value for money.. the only way to let these girls know they are asking too much is to stop going to see them..imagine if all of punters looked at the value first and cut it back by 10%.

Thanks for TOFTT seeking85.  This appears to be a variation on the tantric massage theme and although not as expensive as most tantric massages its still a huge ripoff. For $160, you think you'd a least get a competent massage.

I have seen the Ad also and nearly made a booking a few months ago, but she only works certain days. It's one of those bait Ads with sensual pics, that don't deliver! You can get a very decent relaxation massage for a lot less.

I was there couple months ago...same BS...regret going there. 
I asked her why she publishing Sensual if there is NOTHING sensual. she is naked (and looks great) but not a single touch in any direction.
She replied with long explanation about spirituality and all sort of staff...so told her my spirit does not connect with hers 
maybe I should write to consumer affairs and say its misleading advertising

It's not really misleading advertising if she specifically says no sexual contact. She pretty much does what she says. I think punters get confused when she asks so much, they think she will be a sure thing. I certainly did and most of you guys did too. As for service it's illegal to do more without a escort license. Hopefully others will now know not to waste their money and see her.

There are others advertising Tantric Massage service with higher prices again, around $250hr. Also stating no sexual services! My advice is go to a brothel, or get a legit massage for under $60, then go to a brothel to release all of your sexual tension! Save your dollars!

I can't find the Ads right now but I'm sure they are all around Seaford/Franston and advertised on Gumtree and Locanto. They do say "It's not a sexual service."

well if we want to get technical if you read my review properly you'd see that she didnt sing like a canary whilst tits were on display which is something she said she offered. so NO, she doesnt do exactly whats advertised. furthermore, if all masseuses did what they say 'no sexual services' this part of the massage industry would be dead and this section of the forum would not exist. its called a punt, mainly there's a score, but sometimes there is a miss. this one is a miss and many punters would appreciate this review. simple really

I can't say I have EVER gone to RnT to see if they can sing like a canary.  A Hj and possibly more yes! Next time bring your own Canary, or ask for some music.

What a pity you did not post your review and then everyone would have known that issue.

My experience/comments : 

This had happened about two weeks ago. I had this number saved in my phone so thought to send a text and asked if they got any new girls. I got a reply right away. I was told that there is a new arrival from Japan "Kimiko". I asked to confirm if she is really Japanese as I have something special about Japs. It was confirmed and send me some photos of Kimiko with Japanese Kimono. I thought that should give a try and made a booking for later in the day. I went to the place (I have been there before so knew the place but asked the address again) in SE suburbs (not far from me) on time. When I messaged to inform that I am there I was asked to wait 10 min, bit disappointed. But got a call in about 10 min so went in the same apartment where I was about a year ago. I was asked to sit and wait in the living room as another punter was finishing with Kourtney (second girl, Aussie and many reviews about her here). Myself and Kimiko were waiting  there until "bye -bye" happened. So, as you understood there were two girls but one room as they were taking turns. Not the best scenario. Anyway, Kimiko was nice, nice body and was friendly. Didn't understand English much and I really don't think that she is Japanese. Who cares. She made the room quickly and we were ready to go. Kourtney was out and started playing waiting game. Kimiko gave good time and was very natural and smooth, had good skills. I judged that the time I have spent was valuable.
Went to shower together (Yes, had shower together before the session as well) and I was ready to leave. I heard from the living room that next punter was waiting in the lobby. So, after me it was Kourtney's turn again.
Overall, it was a good.

This consortium of working girls here, have not responded to texts, and the mobile number goes straight to message bank. Pacific brown found them, and now they seem to have moved on again. Dam.

I think I have been there.If it's the one I'm thinking of it's a private Asian lady in an apartment near QV.She is in her 40s and was working solo when I saw her probably a year ago.Extras were on offer but not cheap from memory.

Yes, her name is Michelle and works on her own at a ver private, very secure apartment at 24 Jane Bell Lane, the Officeworks Lane at QV complex. I have been a few times and became good friends. She's very articulate and well educated. She offers a very relaxing, very sensual massage. Sometimes she will dress in
very fine lingerie to tease you with a perfect shape size 6 body. Although she swears
she's not in any diet or exercise, her lovely lines makes her 10-15 younger. In terms
of extras I'm sure you will find a way to get yo know her and discover what specials she has. I'm not gonna comment on what I had only that it was different every time. There was even an occassion where we had a lovely massage in her shower. She is a very respectful and although the place is not the tidiest I am sure she will make the best to
accomodate you and make you feel refreshed. Good luck.

Having not paid standard prices ever, I'd say she might charge $70-75 for the massage. Extras included $90-150.

I have visited this place. Agree with the review above - very lovely lady working alone. Very respectful and well spoken. Prices seem negotiable, but $75 for close to one hour incl happy ending is very reasonable. Some extras def on offer, but not sure of price. Good central location and a shower available if you need. I recommend it!

Yes, very unique lady, one of my best massages ever. 

She did do a bit of self promotion, but not during the massage. I think on repeat visits, many things could be possible with her. Ill be back. 

RE price, i think you can negotiate down, certainly shouldnt be over $100 without FS.

I think I know this lady, she used to have a place in the eastern suburbs a few years ago, and has beautiful long nails (usually painted pink or red), does that sound right?  If so, she is definitely worth a visit, just a pity she is in the city these days.

Hi Guys.....I have visited her several times though 2 years ago now. She is lovely and all the reviews are generally spot-on. She offers three levels as she calls it. Massage and RnT, BBBJ which was amazing and FS whicch wasnt offered the first time but was later...gotta say FS was great but I still cannot get over the BJ which was mind-blowing....Will return when I am next in town definitely.

I saw Michelle last week for the first time. very friendly, articulate, asks a lot of questions, but she is just looking after her own security.  the body is amazing!  I'm not sure how old she is, but its a killer body.  i'm going back to see if I get to level 3.

Saw Michelle and enjoyed an 1hr+ of nice, relaxing, complete body, sensual massage and tug. Last 20min I asked for nude and she kindly stripped her fine lingerie leaving only her bright red string panty. As said many times, she's got the killer body. Total damage $90 (YMMV). Apparently she's offering a special price for newcomers  Good luck and happy punting.

After punting around town looking for a good consistent massage with a tug, I have found that the usual suspects suffer from high turnover and hit and miss quality. Now I have found Michelle at Nirvana I know where to go for a consistently good massage. She doesn't mind a chat - sometimes the conversation wanders around, but a very giving, caring lady who knows exactly what she's doing. Great massage, lovely atmosphere and a very happy ending.

Busy lady - make sure you book.

My first time with Michelle was last month. Over the phone she offered $110 and $150 / hr service, which I took the cheaper option. And she gave me a "discount" of $90 when I arrive. To be honest I guess she is around 40, her look is so so but still got a good and firm body. She said that she's born in Fiji and have been living in Hawaii?? for a while.

To her massage skills, it is quite good with the relaxing background music. There are no rushing during the session and I agree that it is very relaxing. In the end she give me a slow firm tug, which is one of the best I've experienced. Quite different from those mechanical hj I got from the young chinese gals. She has took off her red lingerie during the "2nd half" of the massage and exposing her B/C cup breast, and it's quite funny that she seems to be embrassed when I stare at her nipples. 

In general, it is good service and enjoyable time. The down side is she is a bit too talkative and didn't recongised that I was about the blow until it wet her hands.... 

Will I be back? Maybe. The service is good but a bit pricy for a tug, but wants to try out her bj.

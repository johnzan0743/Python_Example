Sounds too good to be true kind of thing doesn't it? Must be something like a fake pic or something.

I'll still go and check it out but have reservations.

I think you'll find the curtains don't match the carpet. 

I must say they are either enterprising ripoff artists or they are simply clueless! Agree furiously with all above. Perhaps if they are truly "French" probably on a student visa or perhaps a tourist visa which means they have no work permission endorsement on their visa or indeed if they have work permit restrictions on their Visa then mentioning that DIAC may be interested in reviewing their status might get you a handy or if they are as off their tits as they sound bugger it just ring the DIAC dobber line and get the French filth outa here! 
BTW If they have a student visa they can only work for places that issue them with a payslip. According to ATO rules they pay the highest marginal rate of tax and may face deportation if they accept cash without paying tax on their base pay. this means that tips they receive in any shop are more valuable as they are worth almost twice what they are legally entitled to. 

Don't throw away your hard earned cash. Save it and go to the pub. Get drunk and go home. If you wake up the next day feeling fucked just be grateful.

Agree with most of the above, I received the same text messages including photos, not really that hot anyway and far too pricey. However, racism is never required and is somewhat offensive.

Senta,

I apologise if my comments were the cause of your offence.

I perceived my comments as stereotyping, rather than racism.

I have checked the definition of racism on the web and it is classed as:

rac·ism  
/ˈrāˌsizəm/
Noun

1. The belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, esp. so as to distinguish it as...
2. Prejudice or discrimination directed against someone of a different race based on such a belief.

Synonyms

racialism

Thus my assertion that all French women have hairy underarms (my implied intent) is in fact consistent with point one.

I have learnt something today and will use my executive moderator powers to delete my post.

Thank you for enlightening me.

I do have a question, is it illegal for me to dislike the French government of the day that authorised the sinking of a civilian ship, in my neighbours harbour, by military personnel, killing two civilians, misplaced?

Cheers


Chalk

A bit overdone in my view.

<OT rant>

Who would be wrong in characterising the Asian races as having dark hair and dark eyes ?

If so, racism is scarcely the perjorative or negative term that many people believe it is. It is in fact another name for 'classification'.

A Google search for "French women underarm hair" returns a ton of results including, 

Underarm hair - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

which suggests that European women (and therefore French as well as English women) only began underarm
depilation after WW2, and so could be characterised as having hairy underarms.

</OT rant>

Now that Mr Chalk has explained his cryptic post, it's clever and amusing.

I am just  bewildered because I thought the Freeeeaaanch were simply Western Europeans but what would I know. just because one of my siblings married into the culture and oh yeah I am a bona-fide Francophile.


I think our mods are very clever. The thing is not everybody has an edumacashun most unlike the Chalky Farts who are Latin Scholars with apologies to anyone who may feel aggrieved!!!

PB these girls are simply overpriced tourists not as in the pic. They have been scamming the locals but pretty sure the locals are none too impressed.
At the risk of being accused of racism. I believe you should call a spade a shovel. But that is one man's "O"!


Biggus.

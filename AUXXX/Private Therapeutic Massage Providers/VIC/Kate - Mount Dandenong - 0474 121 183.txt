I saw Kate's advertisement on gumtree and decided to give it ago!!
it was easy to make an appointment and I was on my way upto the mountains!!
she was based in a nice house in the mountains and offered a shower before the massage,

I lied on the table after the massage and she started the massage with out draping!! long flowing strokes over and under the body!! lots of touches with the mini mee!! I was thinking I have found a winner here!! time to roll over!! and she decides to put a tiny towel on mini me!! . it was still a great massage on my back!! I asked about extras and she politely refused!! but it could be different for the regulars tho?? basically it was a great sensual massage with NO EXTRAS at the end!!

place 9/10
personality 10/10

She used to work at Kew and definitely offered extras.  I visited her twice and tipped her $50 on both occasions for a topless finish.  
She did say she was leaving and operating closer to home at Mt Dandy.
Maybe extras reserved for regulars given that its now from her home?

Hey guys, sorry to bring up an old thread but was making up a list of ladies around Melbourne I want to see.

Did some very quick google sleuthing to see if she was still around. 

Turns out I've seen her on the news before! Something about a lady going all the way to NT/ Alice springs and giving a natural birth in a river. And she filmed it all or something, can't remember it was a long time ago.

I'm pretty sure it's her. Blonde hair, leopard spot tattoo on her arm?

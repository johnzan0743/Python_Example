Nationality or Ethnicity: Inian/Singapore mix

Searching around on the typical internet web sites and came across add for massage with 25 Singapore girl. Made an appointment and off I went - Monica is very friendly and chatting and offers a senual massage, although sat Singapore more Indian but very pale maybe mixed and senual massage is more like a light massage. Not really my thing but she has a killer body but no touch and fully clothed. I thought I had a dud until I ask asked to flip and then gently stroking and accidently touching the balls I knew more could be on offer. I smiled at the her and she asked if I wanted a nice ending and tipped $20. Monica took her time very slow build up and was playing with my member for a good 15 mins before I was over the line. 

I would go back just for a chat and massage - she is on holiday for two weeks but will be back after.

She is definately on holiday - the Satyrday I went was her last day and she was fully booked out - I would imagine she will be operating again next week. Time for another visit if she has spent her holiday money - maybe get more offered.......

There is angst because of people such as yourself with a limited grasp of the human ability to make simple mistake.
I missed the last line as I was reading on a mobile device at the time, hence my question.

If you have frustration borne from the annoyance caused by others on purpose, make sure you direct it at the right people in future.

Eloquently put.

I too make mistakes and clearly this was one. 
Please accept my sincere apologies.

But a word of caution to all here if this is the same as my lass as my review on 25 yr old Indian .......a locanto ad, you can do much much better.

Sorry just realized it was posted on another forum.....
Here is my review.
Same shop location....

Went to the usual sources and found an ad for a Camberwell location that intrigued me a little and thought, what the hell, I haven't taken one for the team for a while so why not.

After about 20 odd SMS messages I knew that this was a RnT venture. When your told don't come through the front door, the English is just so so, the timing issues etc etc there was little doubt that a T was in order.

When I got to to address and ushered up the stairs it was simply too late to pull out, she was not glamour material, far from it, but to be discourteous at this point would have been ruder than I can be. 

She may be 25 but I doubt it, maybe 155 cm and a size 12 but very untoned if that's a word. Big cans but not nice and that fine hair all over her body. 

She happily does nude with a T for $100 per hour and I slipped her an extra for BBBJ. It was ok but not an accomplished practitioner of the fine art.

WIR ....no
Body ...4/10
Massage Skill 4/10
T .....6/10
BBBJ ...5/10

You can't win them all but at least there were no blue balls.

Tryhard what number did you ring? The plump indian girl has a different number to Monica
0401586149. There might be a few girls using the same venue.

Can someone please clarify this post.The review by Tryhardaussie doesn't appear to be of the same girl as the original post and Camberwell is not Hawthorn.
I'm sure I'm not the only one confused by this.

To further confuse things,I called the number in Pacificbrown's post #11 and it belongs to a girl called Annu who works in Prahran.This thread is seriously mixed up.

IMHO it's not that confusing if I read ir right.
It appears 2girls work from the same place.
The one that I refer too advertises in locanto under the non too difficult section personal services. ...... Search Indian female and there you have it....
It is definitely the same venue ....I had a coffee and party pie 2doors down ...not too bad.

When I called the plump one, she said it was in Camberwell. 
In any case, sounds like one to avoid being plump and all. 
Monica, though, is on the to do list.

This is all over the place.  I've had the same result as Toomuchtime and Pacificbrown, I called the second number and got onto Annu in Prahran.  I've also tried the original which appears to still be off.  She must be on hols still.  I'm keen on her return though, I'm working in Hawthorn at the moment and am keen to see her!

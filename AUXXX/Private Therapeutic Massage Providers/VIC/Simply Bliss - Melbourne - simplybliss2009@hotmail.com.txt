My experience/comments: (Here you must have at least 1 full sentence - "Ill be back" or "good value" is not a sentence or review. 20 word minimum please) After reading various reviews about Simply BLiss I decided to try her just before Xmas. I am pleased I did as she has given my one of the best massages that I have ever had. She managed to get to all the parts of my body that needed attention. Simply Bliss loves her job and it tells in the job that she does.

THIS IS THE BORING PREAMBLE

So I have been lucky enough to meet Bliss socially on several occasions. FIA drinks, Rebel Alliance Drinks, SDU drinks and PP drinks. She is always a delight to chat to. Down to Earth, loves a laugh and is very easy to get along with. Every time I saw her I would say to myself "I must get down to see her one of these days". As she only operates daytime Monday to Friday it wasn't as easy as it sounded. When I took some time off for Christmas I made enquiries as to when would be a good time and Wednesday 3pm was set.

I listened to the cricket on the drive over and that was increasingly depressing as the Poms were starting to take control of an Ashes series they had no business of winning. I made it to the secret location with about 10 mins to spare so took the time to find a park in the shade as it was a super hot afternoon.

NOW THE ENCOUNTER

So I am greeted by Bliss at the door with a smile and a kiss and am led into her 'office'. She brings me a glass of water and gives me a few minutes to disrobe and get myself on the table.

NOW THE FUN STUFF

Bliss returns, the lights dim, the soothing music calms my nerves and Bliss goes to work. What ensured was a thorough all body massage. No body part was missed. I would describe it as more sensual than therapeutic but that's not to say it didn't have therapeutic properties. By the time I turned over I was getting in the mood for sure. The massage included lots of teasing and hints as to what was to come.

When it came finish time it became apparent Bliss has been to the ball a few times and the desired outcome was achieved with gusto and pleasure.

So to surmise, a fantastic experience. I was so relaxed and in a zone my hour felt like 15mins. When I checked my phone it was indeed a full hour. Bliss as always was easy to talk to and I walked out feeling so much better than when I walked in. So thank you Bliss. Hopefully I can get a day off during the week soon to visit again.

At the request of Simply Bliss, I have removed reference to her real name and phone number. 

If interested in  making a booking, either send her an email or PM.

While we normally do want as many contact details as possible, sometimes the ladies prefer it otherwise, and since we are here for both members and industry people, we try to accommodate their requests.

Thanks for your understanding.

I had the pleasure of being blissed today. I've never had a 90min massage but it seemed like about 30min - I just got lost in it all. I also tried the lomi lomi which is AMAZING! This would have to be the THE BEST massage I've ever had. 
Now guys I have to say something here - if you just want a quick RNT, go somewhere else! If you are after BBBJ or FS - treat this beautiful lady with some respect and go somewhere else!
If you want the best quality professional massage - a FULL body experience - in a well appointed room, with a kind and caring lady - why go anywhere else? Why would anyone want to go to a grungy smelly shopfront with dirty towels and no privacy to plead with some skanky asian girl who can't speak english, plead for a HJ and pay far too much? Not Me! The massage is so good you could send anyone there (she does legit work by the way) and the bliss part is out of this world.

Went and booked in for last Tuesday after reading reviews here, and may I just say that those hands know where to go.  The best RnT experience ever.  I felt sensations that I didn't know existed and not only that, it was like my pleasure was being coaxed out slowly, not just tolerated and get the fuck out.  Even after orgasm, that was seen as just part of the massage.  A real experience and a half.  If only she could train these young RnT'ers.

ok, I know these are old reviews of mine, but if anything, she has gotten better..... if that's possible. I have seen her many times. 

--------------------------------------
I had been in contact with SB the other week and an appointment was set. I had never had a professional massage before, much less a Blissage....

I arrived and from the first moment, was made very welcome and comfortable. She showed me to the "dark room" with the soothing music and aroma of scented oils. 
Now naked, I get on the table face down and waited for her return. I hear the door open and almost instantly, hands are running up my legs....Mmmmm.
Then those warm oils go to work and id swear i had a octopus giving the massage. It seems her hands are everywhere at once!
For my first massage, it was becoming obvious i had started with the absolute best!! I now feel sorry for all those who have had hit and miss massage with the pretenders, but once you have been blissed....you will never look elsewhere. 
I was sooo relaxed, I could have gone to sleep...glad i didn't though as i would have missed it. 
Well as has been said before, the hour seemed like 15 minutes. I really had to take my time getting up, she had really done a number on me.

Will I be back.......what a stoopid question!!! Without question!! 
Next time, i may have to opt for a 2 hour session......

Thanks SB, you are a master of your craft

Rupe


And a few weeks later.....................
What can i say.......i just had to go back!! Only way i could think of improving my hour in bliss is with 2 hours in bliss.....so a 2 hour session was booked.

So, into the room we go and she delivers probably the most lingering massage possible. Very light caressing and firm rubbing were the flavour of the day!! 
Going by the smile on her face, she really enjoys teasing....getting you right to the point where you are about to explode.....and gently bringing you back down to earth.....only to take you straight back up again...and again.....and again. When she finally lets you cum....it seems to go off for longer than i thought possible!! 
From any angle, she has an amazing touch, and right from the word go, was in a very naughty mood.......i brought that on myself....lol

Our next session style has already been decided......Mmmmm, Lomi Lomi style..... 

There is only 1 thing that isnt good about a Blissage......she really takes it out of you so dont have anything energetic planned for the rest of the day....lol

She's relocated and is operating from a studio in a large rec centre. Still in same suburb and anyone who hasnt tried her before , she's charging $35/hr for new clients till 13/08. Thats a steal even as a base rate.

Not quite sure what i can say here other than apologies if i haven't got back to anyone :-( and as for the reply regarding not taking on any new clients, I was in the thresholds of retiring & i think i emailed you. I have however decided to hold off at the moment.  
All that is required to secure a response from me or to make an inquiry is simple...either PM (best way) or email me, include your username and the forum your from plus sign off with your real name....essential details!
Make it respectful - not stupid, if you've read the reveiws then you have a pretty good idea what I do. Don't fish for more and don't ask for a pic! Seriously, it doesnt't matter :-[ trust me, if you can keep your eyes open during a session with me then I'm not doing right lol
As for the gumtree ad, you must be kidding if you think a bliss session is on offer for $35!? LMFAO!!
I hate to be this blunt and direct, but it's the type of dribble like this that made me think about retiring in the first place, my apologies to the intelligent members. Keep it real please, that's all I ask.

Namaste and hugs

SB xxx

My experience/comments : I've been a few times before but now she has returned to her original studio. The service is still awesome with a warm smile and hands that know how to please. It is truly simply bliss. I don't think she is taking new clients so those of us fortunate enough to have been blessed, get amongst it!

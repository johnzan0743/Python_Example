I texted her last week. She had another girl there and was advertising 4 hand massage. I enquired re sensual massage/extras but her response was negative. Relaxation only.

Nah PB I think she must be dreaming especially if she carries on with the bullshit of yes I do sensual but no I don't really. What do you mean? I don't understand the meaning of the word "sensual" ? 

I have been through this BS before with other loons who work in Vic. They also have a completely different definitions for various constructs such as Full body massage and Complete full body massage. sensual massage, intuitive massage even hot stone massage.
In other places both Australia and around the world there are accepted definitions for some of these constructs but in Victoria they use their own definitions which have absolutely nought zero zip to do with the real meaning of the words. 

Making up your own definitions and meanings is a favourite pastime of some of the ML's in Melbourne. They do it to tease the clients in to punt and of course they don't ever put out. not even a tweak. So save your money if you want a tug from someone who vacillates so from one position to the other hopping from one foot to the other steer well clear and they will disappear and stop advertising or they may start performing as they advertise. Those that play games will get caught out and those that give value will be rewarded. Some of these ladies end up becoming too fickle for anyone to take them seriously.

The moral of the story is. Upon entering the premises if you want a tug ask directly if you think they won't put out that way you might get a lets wait and see which means it is likely on. If they definitely won't or don't ever do then you have the option of leaving.
It is unlawful to charge up front if issuing a receipt for massage. So if charged upfront be aware it is more likely that not the tug or extras may be on.
Otherwise walk away don't pay and tell your mates on this forum.


Collective wisdom!!

It's just a bit of fun Biggus and curiosity. They're adding their spin to things. I wont be going the drive out to Beaconsfield but will be very interested in reading the review. Like a lot of others, I've punted for many years and know very well how to suck an egg.

PB not meaning to be informing you of anything. The post was for the benefit of some newbies. Guys won't ask but value input and discretion from old timers like yourself and yours truly. The forum is about informing others both education and technique.

Hey if you want a laugh go to the GD forum and read the thread "I hate it when?" now there is some real funny shit there
.
As for Vic the ladies think they can charge wtf they like with impunity as well as rewrite the language change the meanings of words and just play dumb. We don't have to take that. No make that we shouldn't have to accept that.


But then a beanbag mooffee now that is a different twist on enjoying one's punt!!!

Hear, hear !

Those interested in being sucked in by false pictures, false advertising and paying more for less, keep on paying and not
posting your experiences as reviews.

What AuXXX is about is correcting the market by improving the information available to consumers (yes, we the paying punter) so that the bad providers get less business, and the good providers get rich, stay happy & we all have fun (fade to sunset, waves breaking on beach etc).

Difficult since the main difference between a prolific poster of reviews such as Biggus, it seems to me, is in attitude.

Some of the reasons I hear for not posting a review include things such as

 - it's hard from a mobile

 - no one wants to hear about an ordinary punt

 - no one wants to hear if the service was the same as last time

My attitude may be like BD's: the urgency of getting the news out about what's hot and what's not, irrespective
of how good a time I had.

At least a few lines describing the circs, the lady, and the experience usually help recreate the experience for the
author at least and maybe for others. 

They can then be better advised about parting with their cash.

Yes, a review is a blunt instrument. When I am wondering whether to gamble with an unknown lady at an unknown
place, even if the service comes highly recommended, there's no guarantee that it will have a Happy Ending. Vica
versa, sometimes it's fun to gamble and risk it, in the hope of striking gold.

There's another aspect of reports that I don't hear about much but I expect those in the Silver Lounge will agree with.
It is recognising the warning signs of a looming bad experience and maybe then looking for an opportunity to bail
and reducing the losses. 

Either way, a report is better for those that follow.

There may be something in that PB for newbies.

But I for one would not like to assume and therefore possibly be accused of patronising anyone on this forum. I am certain their are plenty who are new to the forum that have plenty of punting experience such as myself. 
However it would be wrong of me to be instructive towards a new member unless of course they ask for assistance in which case there are many experienced members who have no problem suggesting techniques and ways to approach various situations.
Punts to start out on and even some industry gals willing to assist to boost their bottom lines out of the goodness of their hearts.

I think we should assume members join the forum to punt and review. Some pay simply to read the reviews however it should be up to all members to entertain others with honest reliable information mostly in the form of a review on a worker or working situation.

There are also wonderful opportunities to express oneself in the forums and develop writing styles that entertain and inform.

Those that enjoy watching paint dry are the ones who's reports you can use instead of sleeping pills. Fortunately they are few and far between. We must encourage better expression and always applaud loudly well written entertaining reviews. They really add to the rich tapestry which this forum has developed.

There will always be room for average punts to be reviewed as workers lift their games upon realising there are fewer punters darkening their doorsteps.
 This is really a true market driving tool as those who read and heed the forum affect the viability of those dud punts.

it is all good. Smiling is what it is about. happy punting.



Biggus.

OOoh I know oooh yeth I know! 

I have no pearls of wisdom just tried true and tested.

Nothing is foolproof mostly because fools are simply so ingenious!

Now I had posted a copy of a very funny review entertaining and excellent reading by Happy Chappy in the Jenna thread a new Redhead beauty in Northern Sydney. I think the mods may have removed it from this thread but if anyone wants to read what a great review is about then read from some of our best and entertaining members.

I only have a little wisdom to contribute to the forum and need most of it to punt myself. So when I share it is sincere and from the loins. You know the lower gut feelings. The ones that say preservation is of the highest order.
This as you know comes only from experience not from nature.

Would love to read one of your reviews soon. Melbourne needs more detailed well written recent reviews and possibly less quips.

cheers. PB.

Ahh But they are and the beauty of this is they can be and are both!

Now if anyone wants a fantastic read follow this link.

http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f277/h...s-bride-20050/

This is one of the funniest and most erotic bawdy reviews you will read on this site.

I had copy and pasted it before but as this is a massage thread probably deemed out of place. Now Jenna is worth every cent I have on good authority. Problem is for Vic bound members it is a couple of cut lunches and a picnics ride away. Or you can always plan the Redeye express to meet the Redhead Expression!

There are some extremely talented individuals on this site so yes. But writing skills can be developed and honed.
One can only try!

Our problem is the nanny state,

I would be happy to write so much more. But I do not want to spoil the fun I already have.
Maybe I should move to NSW, not as harsh on the hard working ladies which I admire so much!!
We are here for a good time and hopefully a very long time!!!!
As I grow older, I really admire a woman's body. They are so sexy. All shape and sizes. All beautiful, soft, gentle...
ok enough of me.

Have Fun

Date of Visit : 12 June

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0422 294 112

Hours of Business : 6 Days a week ( no Sun ) call for hours

Rates : $60 per hour

Age : 30+

Size/shape : 16 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Kiwi

Value for money/recommend? : For massage - yes

My experience/comments :

After seeing no reviews for a place close to me I thought I would check out .

This lady is quite clear that extras are not available - when I booked she texted her address with a note saying no sexual services .

Leah operates from the family home, has another therapist working with her apparently and offers a 4 hand service for $100 an hour .

Quite a good sensual massage .

About 3 signs up around the massage room saying no sexual services performed .

Would recommend the massage if that's all you wanted but if you want more look elsewhere

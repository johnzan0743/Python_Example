I have got to tell about this wonderful woman offering the best relaxation i have experienced, she has such great hands offering a Typical Thai Oil Massage, i have been to Thailand, and i think she is brilliant, moreover she has the second best pair of puppies that i have seen on a Thai lady, great when she uses them to your advantage
If you want the number post me.

I have booked into see her tomorrow.  Wasn't sure if she was just a legit massage or something else.  I didn't ask over the ph and she didn't elaborate.  Hopefully it is as good as you let on.  very hard to find a local RnT in this area.  Having spent a year in Perth, they are everywhere over there, just cant seem to find them in Melbourne without going to a brothel.

I have heard that the local newspaper tend to provide the leads, I read of RNT's North of the City, In Richamond, Springvale, Croydon.  Good luck and please post a review.

I rolled up, a pleasant looking lady, maybe mid 30's.  Smelt of a little alcohol, but not overbearing.  I ask her what services does she offer, she days one hour massage $60.  I ask if she does hand relief, she seemed a little coy and said she will see.

The massage was excellent, Iceman is right, those hands know how to get in hard and find spots you had avoided thinking about.  Obviously some training in massage, and well worth the $60 even if nothing else happened. The massage gets a little more exciting as she does your legs, spreading them a little to access right up into the groin, she doesnt avoid contact with the balls, but she also doesnt make special contact either.

Eventually she gets me to roll over, does something a lot of others dont and that is massage the abdominal area, then hands and rests them on her thigh which is soft and beautiful to touch.  She then asks if I do want hand relief, which of course by this stage after a number of near full on rogers, I say yes to.  She keeps doing my quads, massaging right up into the balls.  Does my shins and feet, then she gets to work on the jatz.  I must admit, I have had quite a few good ball massages, but this was something different again.  Wasnt sure if she was pulling on the them or what, but hey ......... a ball massage is good in any disguise.  Eventually she grabs hold of my cock and seeing that the ball massage had done its trick, it wasnt long before emptying my bags.  Anong doesnt just leave you there as others do, she keeps playing with me until I go down then cleans up.

Was it worth the money, YES, I paid over what she was asking because I have paid a lot more for a lot less.  Will I go back?  YES, next week, already have booked.

P.S.  Didn't see the puppies, I could tell they look good, but first time and all, I wasnt going to push the point ( so to speak) but I reckon a body slide with those would do the trick.  It could be a matter of her gaining trust before that happens.

That is the way it works, build the trust, be a regular and all sorts of things may happen, well done Fu, adn as you say $60 for an hours good massage is value in itself.

Let us know how you go next week.

I'm pretty sure this lady now has a shop in Frankston called Nong Thai Massage.I went there a few months ago and saw her.It was a very good massage but no extras and I remembered having seen her before at a private house in Mornington a few years ago.

Toomuchtime you are right. She has a place at 28 Wells Rd, Frankston. Same mobile number. Excellent rooms. High quality massages. But anything more than a massage is luck of the draw or frequent visits.

Cheers

Yes a huge shame Anong has moved on to legit business. I saw her about 15 times over a 2 year period. She called me Mr Big and by the time she moved on I could get whatever I wanted DATY, CBJ, Rimming, Tried fisting but wouldn't fit Dildo and vibe...was fantastic fun and her tits were spectacular. Fantastic Massage

when she was in Prince St, there was a code she had set up.
if you asked for Anong you got a relatively vanilla massage, but if you asked for Mia it was a whole different ballgame

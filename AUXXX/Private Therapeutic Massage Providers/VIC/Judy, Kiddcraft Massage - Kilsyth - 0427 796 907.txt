  My experiences/ comments:

  I went to Judy as a rough punt 2 years ago and found she did a very good deep tissue massage and she had a real preference for me being nude. She always stayed to watch me undress (I liked that even if she was fat). Unfortunately she always kept it professional with only the occasional brush against my balls. 

  A few days ago I got an SMS from Judy requesting I try her again, so I immediately SMS'ed her back asking " what is your cost per hour for nude sensual message". Her immediate reply was $50 cash and a C ya soon. So silly me I thought maybe she had a change and this could be a good cheap thrill.

  Rolled up to an average house with a separate massage apartment that is well fitted out with an separate bath room. Again I walked into the massage room and she stayed with me taking a good look as I stripped and laid face down on the table. She did a wonderful job on my upper back I must admit and then wandered to my bum/ legs. To my disappointment there was very little sack action as she skilfully navigated around it. On the flip again I was fully exposed had the odd brush of the balls and one of my non erect shaft.

  Excellent massage but I really took one for the team here. My gut feel is she likes a good perv and could be convinced to grab a handful but not my cup of tea.

  Stay away.

$5 for the shower I believe. She has been massaging for many many years and never given any extras.

I think that's what it used to be,  I rang her yesterday to confirm and she said its $105 for relaxation or deep tissue and she can combine Lomi Lomi with relaxation for the same price!!

My experience/comments : (Here you must give at least a general  description of the experience which you have had - 25 word minimum is  required to give fellow members an idea of time spent - "Ill be back" or  "good value" is not a sentence or review. )

Easy appointment organized. Discreet location, behind strip of shops, next to car park. Entered into an extremely well presented massage studio.

Greeted at the door by a cute, grungy looking girl. Very relaxed and pleasant.
Starts with a firm massage, lomi style with varying pressure and sensuality. Performs the true lomi, sliding hands under your body.
More than half way into massage she jumped on the table between my legs and focus on butt, legs, high inner thighs with an extremely sensual massage.
Upon turning over she always asks if you'd like a sensual and encourages is it. She continues massage then finishes off very well. Seems to enjoy the fact that you had a  good time.

Fantastic body, unfortunately fully clothed the whole time, great butt!

Definitely no extras.
Anyone else been?

Thanks for the review Tricky. 
Grungy eh, I don't mind if as you say she has I nice butt.
So it was $80 for the hour including HJ or was that extra?

I've been to this particular establishment.

Agreed its a very nice and modern studio, and I get the feeling she might live there. Funny thing is, unless she gave the address, it is the sort of place you'd NEVER just stumble across as it is very discreet indeed with PLENTY of parking.
My experience was great with her, I wouldn't say 'grungy' more 'indie' in appearance but clean and pleasant smelling with a great bathroom.

My first visit unfortunately didn't yield anything but a massage that was very sensual indeed. I was really hoping for a great finish, but nothing there.
However, when I left she mentioned that next visit we'd go 'deeper' in the massage and encouraged me to return, so maybe I just look like an undercover cop or something like that?

I haven't been back, but I'll have to now if your experience rings true

Not having experienced the delights of Lomi Lomi before I decided to give this place a try.

Cassandra gave the massage and matches the description from Tricky's review. I had a very relaxing, unhurried, sensuous massage but no happy ending. 

After I'd had a quick shower she mentioned that $80 is for new customers and normally the rate was $100. For repeat customers she 'tailors' the Lomi Lomi massage technique/strokes so it definitely sounds like there is potential there for a happy ending. 

I had an enjoyable time and would probably return. YMMV.

My mate and i also went to see her after reading the review by Tricky but got js thats is short for jack sh*t. Great massage but clothes stayed on and nothing on offer at all even though i told her that i was after a "fully satisfying massage. My mate reckons he actually asked her for a hj and was told it was illegal and  she asked him to get dressed and leave.

Saw Cassandra about one month ago. Very nice Lomi but no extras. Nice person, and homely service. Don't go if you expect more than Lomi.

Cassandra used to work at NT Therapies in Kew. She will definately do HJ, maybe you just have to ask nicely.

These 2 establishments are owned by brothers I believe. They don't get along I'm told so are in fierce competition.

 Lomi Lomi Surrey Hills -
				
Post Content: 
--------------------------------

Establishment and/or person's Name: South American Lomi Lomi Massage

Contact Details/Address: Surrey Hills, enter via rear lane, 0447 757 758

Prices:$80 for the Lomi Lomi +$50

Age: Estimate 35+

Size/shape: 165cm, dark hair, slim

Nationality or Ethnicity: Says South American but doesn't look it, I would say african mix

Services: Massage ... plus

Value for money/recommend ? not really
My experience: After reading mixed reviews, I was not sure what to expect but she sounded nice and friendly on the phone and easy to book. The place is easy to find and has parking at the rear. Nice little office/studio with shower available.
Started face down on the table (no cover, to help with the sliding), some chat and a lot of sliding and slipping of the hands above and under the body. Just before the flip over the hands seem to find their way towards the fun parts, so I though this could be better than expected.
Flipped over and the lomi continued, I have to say it was a really nice massage and I would have been happy with it to stay that way, but part of my was as pointing to the ceiling, which she commented on and had a laugh.
I asked whether anything else was available and the rub becmae a tug, which was a bit of a let down. She said she doesn't normally offer, and I can believe that as technique was poor.
After the conclusion, handed over an extra $50 and left part relaxed and part dissapointed, as the rub was how I should have left it.
Nice lady, great massage, I would say don't ask for any more as you will get a refusal, unless she is in the mood and you have a good interaction. But, the lomi was great.

Establishment and/or person's Name: Lomi Lomi Massage Surrey Hills Vic

Contact Details/Address: Surrey Hills Vic - Advertises in local paper

Prices: $80 per hour

Age: 20s 

Size/shape: 5ft 6-7 Very Attractive

Nationality or Ethnicity: Australian

Services: Massage & HJ

Value for money/recommend ? Yes. 

My experience:This place has been reviewed a number of times in this forum. I went there at the start of 2012 and saw Kathleen, a young Australian girl. It sounds like there is a South American girl working there exclusively now. The place is at the back of a group of shops and is in a very nice new unit. There are shower facilities available. The massage was good but not great (in a lomi lomi style) but Kathleen was nice and when an offer was made towards the end of the massage she accepted and she got me across the line. I would go back again.

This post will need to be moved to Vic - Private Massage - South East - Surrey Hills - Lomi Lomi

Establishment and/or person's Name: Cassandra

Contact Details/Address: As mentioned

Prices: $80.00

Age: 30?

Size/shape: Slimish

Nationality or Ethnicity: African American

Services: Lomi Lomi Massage

Value for money/recommend: Yes and No

My experience: I've seen Cassandra a few times, and on each occasion I have managed to get hand relief. I think she is trying to stay legit as her massage is really good, she does have skill.

I normally don't ask for the HJ she can see that it needs to be done. On my last visit she did say that she doesn't do it too often anymore. Maybe it was the case during the startup of the business.

Agreed with this post. 

It took me 3 visits, but on third visit she asked if i'd like a sensual finish, but asked that I please don't mention it to friends who may frequent her in future, as its something she'd like to keep with regulars only.

I went back a couple of months ago and did mention the objection to using the phone during the massage and she said no problem she would turn it off blah blah blah.
She was replying to texts from about halfway through! Got what i wanted but the service is about a 2/5 which isn't really worth the drive. Oh and the ads have stopped on gumtree but turned up in news classifieds

 Surrey Hills Lomi Lomi

Person's Name : C

Establishment : Private Studio

Date of Visit : October 2012

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Lomi Lomi Surrey Hills

Hours of Business : 10am - late

Rates : $80 + $20

Age : 30

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : American

Services Provided : Lomi Lomi HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes and No

My experience/comments : 

C used to advertise on gumtree but has dropped that and now is in local blue. Her studio is a private separate dwelling behind a strip of shops. She is very pleasant and affable and not unattractive but not particularly my style.
The massage is a great Lomi Lomi massage. She walks around the table many times during the course of a 60 minute session working from your leg up over your butt then your back across the shoulders down the other arm and leg. Lots of oil, after about 10 minutes the under strokes start which even though you expect them they still surprise and enliven you when her hand slides up the inside of your leg and continues under your body between your thigh and your tackle. These come at non sequential timing so you never really know when to expect them. At about the 30-40 minute mark she asks you to flip and some massage continues over the legs and stomach until you reach enough arousal for the main course to start. I have been here a few times and the t ranges from fantastic to average. Seemed to be better in the earlier sessions with lots of teasing and leg rubbing incorporated, so that it was still like part of the overall massage. More recently it is pretty much lets just get this done and get out of here.
The other gripe I have is that more recently, over the past 6 months she has taken to replying to text messages and even answering calls during a session. Because this is a one person operation I can see her dilemma but if when making a booking you point out that last time it was shitty that she kept fucking around with her phone then you would hope she would give it a rest in future.
I wont be heading back any time soon due to the phone issue and I probably would have moved on anyway but for someone looking for a great lomi lomi it is still worth a shot.

Nationality or Ethnicity : American

Services Provided : Lomi Lomi HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

This place is hidden away and unless you do know about it it is near impossible to find it. Stripped and got on the table and C proceeded with a very sensual lomi massage with lots of under and over strokes, really getting into it. She did these leg hugging strokes starting at the feet and moving up the leg and just missing the tackle. With my hands above my head hanging over the table, C started to press herself into me encouraging me to touch. My hands explored everywhere over her leggings and under her top. Finally the flip and I was at full attention. After a little more leg and chest work I popped the question. C said that she thought that she shouldn't do this but agreed for an extra $30. On with the oil and it wasn't long before I couldn't hold on anymore. Showered and out the door. WIR...yes

Not sure if she is still working.
She was quite friendly, happy to chat, did a great massage. On 3rd visit i started to massage her but whilst she was at the head of the table and me on my back.
She didn't mind at all and stopped walking around and she massaged my butt at the same time. Asking if i could give her a massage she replied sure.
So off i get and off she takes her leggings and top leaving her undies and bra on. She has a very fit body and let me massage her pretty much anywhere whilst she was on her back. Thoroughly enjoyable and she returned the favour whilst i got back on the table. Has anyone seen her lately?

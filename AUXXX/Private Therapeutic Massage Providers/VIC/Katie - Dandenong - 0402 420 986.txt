My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Was in the area so looked on Locanto and came across this ad.   Place not easiest to find.   Upstairs .   Katie is I'd say maybe late 40s.    Friendly enough.   Think she runs the place.   Price was 70 for 30 mins including relief.   Massage was reasonable enough but use of baby oil is annoying.   No rubbing or brushing accidentally at all.   The flip arrives and she gets to work right away.   Job done.   It's nothing amazing but it's not bad value at 70.    Not sure how many others work here.

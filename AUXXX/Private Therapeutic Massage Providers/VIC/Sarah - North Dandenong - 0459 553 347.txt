Value for money/recommend? : Possibly, but only if you want to avoid the robotic asian options

My experience/comments : Sarah works from home and values her time so don't be late.  She is a genuinely qualified massage therapist so if you actually need something worked on this is a good option as you'll get the HE to finish.  Be polite and you'll find she is more than accomodating to your needs.  I personally didn't get anything extra on my first visit but on subsequent visits I've been allowed more than just the HE.....light touching etc.

It was just $150 all up....she said she wouldn't ask for more than that and that I'd be more than happy when I left

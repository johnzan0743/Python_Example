Texted like a month ago and got no response. Place just seems to be a ordinary house next to the beach. Ads we're giving me mixed signals, not sure

Rates : 70 p/h

Age : 36-40 i guess

Size/shape : size 10 i guess slim not a bad looking women

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage Only 

Value for money/recommend? : NO 

My experience/comments : Arrived at Orrong Ave Frankston took me 10 mins to park not a best place to park.Welcomed by Youi and was asked to watch out for 
Dogg Poop when i entered her home around 7.20pm.

Directed to the massage room saw her massage qualifications and i though if i don't get any RnT i should get at least a decent massage.She asked me to strip and lie on the table(same drill) and she came back and cleansed my feet with warm water towel etc..

Massage started from neck felt good but as time went it was wack as hell!! The whole time i was cover by a towel and the 
massage didn't have a reasonable pressure,She didn't focus on all areas of the body..i almost slept during the massage coz it was boring and she answers calls during the massage and i can hear punters asking for extras but she kept on declining politely..

I don't really mind if there is no extras but at lease the massage should be good enough..This place is wack for real 2/10. 

WIR : Hell 2 da F** NOoo & damage $70(i could have paid this at $70 at 95 Orange St Bentliegh for an exceptional RnT or Paid $50 for Sumalee Thai Massage Glen Waverly for a quality massage and save $20 )

I saw this ad on Locanto the other day. 

[COLOR=#000000]Hi im courtney im 22 and from frankston and i need help with some pocket money [/COLOR] for rent [COLOR=#000000] bills and food . 0487529327[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#000000]I contacted her and she sent me a blurry photo this is message. 

[/COLOR]Erotic massage is: 70 for 15mins, 140 for 30mins, 180 for the he.
Full service is: 90 for 15mins, 180 for 30mins, 270 for the hr.
Yes I can host.

A google search shows me she had lived in other area's of Melbourne doing massage. And she has used a few different names.

Just wondering if anyone has seen her and can tell me if she is worth a visit?

Pjur.

I messaged her, she replied with her rates and said she was in Frankston, then, a minute later she replied again, same message except that this time she said she is in Moonee Ponds. Asked for confirmation and she replied Moonee Ponds.

Dude, if she is really from Frankston then the $270 is way too much. It does not cost that much to live down there unless you have other habits. BTW nothing to do with putting Frakston down as I spent many years there. She is just having a lend of you...

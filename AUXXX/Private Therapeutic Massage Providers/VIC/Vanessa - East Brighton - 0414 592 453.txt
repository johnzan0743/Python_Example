Person's Name : Vanessa

Establishment : Private - Operates behind her house in East Brighton near North/Hawthorn Roads. She advertises in Leader Newspapers & has an XE number

Date of Visit : April 2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0414 592 453

Hours of Business :  10 - 3 Tue, Wed &Thur

Rates : $100/hour

Age : 50 if she was a day

Size/shape : Medium to slim, not curvy about 5' 4''

Nationality or Ethnicity : Caucasian tanned

Services Provided : Topless massage with HJ

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : Vanessa is a very pleasant well spoken woman & she has a slight limp.  She operates in a little well appointed shed in her back yard - very discreet but it has not shower. She will let you use the toilet in her house.  She does not appear to offer nude service nor touching, gives a fairly good overall massage  with HJ but if you are after a few extras there is better value elsewhere.  If you are a boobs man then hers are nothing flash - flat  leathery & badly sagging.

I think she is going to be up against it to build up a regular clientele.

I too have had one experience only with her. That was enough. She did give me a cbj but she just didn't do it for me. I couldn't even climax cos I thought it was nana on the end of it. Save your money guys. Can't knock her for trying.

Hi Ajarrmac,
There is much better talent, better service & better value out there. This would have to be one of my worst punts. When I initially contacted by phone she said that BJ was not on the menu. I never thought of asking for CBJ. Was this included or did you have to pay extra? 

Did you read  my review before you went?

I'm pretty sure she only survives on 1 off punters taking a risk. I don't think she would have any regular clientele.

I actually had been before I read your review. I didn't ask for it she just did it to me. I wish I had seen your review prior to my visit, then I certainly would have not made the effort.

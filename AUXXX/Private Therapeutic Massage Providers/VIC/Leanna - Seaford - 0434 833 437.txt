this is my third visit to Leanna!!

I saw Leanna's add on the leader newspaper, it was easy to make the booking over the phone and she texted me the address!! She has a large massage room with shower, She has a great personality

On arrival she showed me into the room near the entrance!! asked me what sort of massage I'm after and left me to undress. Lying face down I waited for her to return, 

It was a great massage!! The first thirty mins involved a great massage of my back and legs. The following ten mins of sensual touching to get me ready!! Needless to say, come time for the flip mini me was all ready!!

she made heaps of eye contact and involves herself during the tug!!

I would definitely return!!!

I saw her a few years back...she was calling herself Leelana then. Must have got her on a bad day 
Worst punt of my life...million and one questions when I arrived. Massage was average at best, tug was terrible...
I asked if I could shower after and was abused for not telling her at the start that I wanted a shower, then after about a minute under the water she burst into the bathroom abusing me for taking too long...

WIR? Not in a million years....

Fellas, there is another ML working out of a large house on Nepean Hwy Seaford. I'm curious to know if anyone here has seen her and whether or not she offers extras?

Do you mean the house with the orange and blue massage sign out the front, almost next to the Safeway service station? I can confirm no extras from her. Remedial massage only...

I saw her a few times some years ago, and also thought her massage skills were terrific. I enjoyed several great massages from her, and also thought she had a very good hj skills. Always got me off very quickly she was so good.

Only stopped going because I moved away from the area, and didn't think anything other than a hj was available.....so not worth the special trip.

I am also surprised at some of the postings, I found her to be a very pleasant young lady. We had some similar interests, and I enjoyed chatting with her

I'm with what thepunter said above. Haven't been for about 12 months now, but every time I was there she was more than lovely. Great massage, great tug, good conversation. Nice clean shower, even offered the shower every time. Stripped down to bra and undies for an extra $10, and was happy with touching over them. Not one sign of being a nutter at all.

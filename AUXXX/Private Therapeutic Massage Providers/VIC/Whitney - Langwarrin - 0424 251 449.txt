My experience/comments : Decided to try this one as it was good value and wanted to see if there was anything more. Massage table set up in lounge room, nice set up. Got me to fill out a client form so I knew it was going to be legit.
Had a couple of towels on the table and asked me to get undressed and then get under the towels on my back. Found the table a bit higher than normal which I was a little worried slipping when getting off. She used essential oils and started on chest and shoulders and had firm pressure. Worked on the neck and shoulders and then the arms. All the time with correct draping. Good technique used and then worked on legs and then wiped down all areas with warm towel before turning over for work on back, shoulders and lower back. Not a lot of work around the glutes, that was a little disappointing and then down to legs and feet again before wiped off with warm towel. It was a nice experience, but if you're looking for extras I don't think you'll get them here.

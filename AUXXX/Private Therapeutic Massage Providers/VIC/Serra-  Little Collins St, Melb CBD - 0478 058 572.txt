My experience/comments : This was one of the weirdest massages I've had. The suite I went to had Aura Health Concepts on the door. I've checked their website and they list an office at the same address but this business seems totally unrelated. Nicely appointed room in the middle of an office block. Smoking hot Syrian chick - late 20's early 30's - nice body - tight jeans and a top that disguised what I think were nice C cups.Was offered either a traditional lomi lomi or a very sensual style massage but she wouldn't do any extras or "touch my genitals". I thought what the heck do the sensual one. I was left to undress and I put the rolled up towel under the table and lay face down fully naked. She started with extremely light touching on the back and neck - I thought I was not going to handle the ticklishness but it was OK. I quickly realised it wasn't just her fingernails but something else. As she quickly progressed to my crack and sack i thought it might be her necklace. I asked but was told that would be a surprise. I then thought it might be the pointy end of a feather as she started rimming me with it. I thought at one stage she was going to insert it! This was all strange considering her opening statements. Then I wondered if technically she wasn't touching me, the feather (or whatever was).
On the flip she laid a towel over my mid section and a small hand towel over my eyes (i hate that!). Then a couple of drops of some essential oil on my upper lip (WTF?) and commenced more tickling. She moved the towel to get access to my sack and I said she could get rid of it. That wasn't possible but the way it was balanced on my erection, she was able to tickle everywhere even underneath it without actually touching it. She also went to town on my nipples. It was pretty wild and I asked if the rules could be broken but got a firm no. I even asked if I could DYI but that was only if she left the room. SO eventually it all finished.I asked if it got any better if I was to come back but there was no hint of that. When she left the room, I has seen her hide the implement under the towel (I had eventually taken the hand towel off my face as it was annoying. It was two bamboo skewers bent about an inch from the end! All done I left with blue balls and headed over to Urban Kneads to finish off. As I headed out on the street the question of hygiene hit me - did she keep using the same skewers on everyone's date and sack?
Done it once - won't go back!

arranger62 (and everyone posting reviews) can you PLEASE include a phone number for the provider you are writing about? A review without contact details is totally useless to our members. How can anyone book them?? Its a waste of a moderators time to be trawling the internet looking for phone numbers that should be automatically included in reviews.
Also you posted this review in the Bronze members Lounge. Silver members post in the main forum please...

hello guys. went and saw sera last week and had a very similar experience to arranger 62 (though she didnt use any bent skewers hahahaha) lots of teasign and bit of tickle of the sack on the turn but when asking for hand relief she said no but i think she was sussing me out? i think if you build relationship with her you may get more after a few times. does anyone have any thing to report here or is she just a tease ?

Don't be lazy, post your full complying review. If all members took your attitude the forum would be of no use. Whilst being a member since 2010 you post mainly comments rather than complying reviews. Time to change to be a contributor.

My experience/comments : an update to the previous review is that i have now seen Serra 3 times which have all been after work so the massage place has always been quiet and private. the last time i had massage was similar to first and secnd time with nice slow massaging of all my body with some tickling and very soft touching. but this time after the flip this time she starting getting very close to mini me, alot slower and closer than my previous two times with her. as i sensed something more may be on offer here  i asked her if she could do any other services and she said what do you mean. i then asked for hand relief as i removed the towel covering my eyes. she smiled and thought about for a few seconds and said that will be 30 extra. i noded and thought finally. she then removed the towlel and applied oil my hard cock. her method is teasing at the first and she played with my balls with her nails again as she always does with is so fantastic but then moved to my shaft and started a slow tug. it was very good and then she got faster and as i grabbed her ass and rubbed it a bit before i knew it i just exploded. she seemed to really enjoy it watching me and making good eye contact and has a good method for tugging. she helped clean me up and we had a bit of small talk. she then left the room and i got dressed feeling nice and relaxed, we had a nice hug and i paid her then i left.

i dont know if i will be back, 120 for an hour fully clothed and massage is not therapuedic its just light toching but maybe . i think ymmv with this one but treat her well and you will get some good service for her.

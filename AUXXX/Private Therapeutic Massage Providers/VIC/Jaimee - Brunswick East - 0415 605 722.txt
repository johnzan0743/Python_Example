My experience/comments : 

Saw the ad on locanto, texted her, and we arranged a time for this afternoon. I was a bit surprised that it was a shop, but when I got in, let's just say shades of 300 Bell and leave it at that. First up, the massage: excellent, and I would return for massage alone. Jaimee is an excellent masseuse, has an excellent grasp of English, and also does facials and is a trained beauty therapist.

For 30 minutes you only get a back massage, but I asked if I could have the last 5 minutes front. She was cool with that. Towards the end there was no indication of any extras, so I asked if I could DIY, Jaimee indicated that the boss was in (not usual, apparently), and she was a bit concerned of getting sprung even on a DIY. Apparently if I were to return and slip her a couple of lobsters I wouldn't need to to DIY. She was OK with DIY, did a nice bit of ball rubbing, but was concerned about the boss prowling around outside, and a camera somewhere also. I ended up not completing, due to boss calling Jaimee.

She's a really cool chick, great masseuse, and if her handy is half as good as her massage it should be something. I'm a bit reluctant to pay $40 though, so if I return might see if I can bargain her down.

WIR? Yes, I'll give her another go 

PS Mods -- if you want to move this into the massage parlour thread as it's a day spa in the northern suburbs that's fine; I just don't know the name of the establishment...

 Massage Pozitiva - Carnegie - 0406 793 853
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Natalie

Establishment : Side door of shop on Neerim Rd, Carnegie

Date of Visit : 06/09/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Gumtree. Glen eira area and Locanto

HoursofBusiness : Mon-Fri 10am to 7pm

Rates : 45-$70, 60-$80, 90-$120 + $50 HJ

Age: mid 20's

Size/shape : size 10

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian with a little euro b'ground(i think)

Services Provided : lomi lomi, relaxation remedial, oh! and HJ

Value/recommend? : sort of. can get cheaper elsewhere

Checking the local gumtree ads and saw a new face come up. Ad looked very proffessional and well written and said (as they all do) strictly non sexual service provided, so i thought, give it a miss.
Next day, scrounging through the ads on locanto and see the same name pop up with a different ad. still stipulating that it was a non sexual service though.
I’m thinking, now Locanto is not the right place to advertise a very legit business because it is full of frauds and junkies.
Though about it and said "WTF" give it a shot. If it turns out to be a legit massage, then nothing to lose except $60, as i like to book for the minimum so i could sus her out.
We talk on the phone and arrange a time and all is good.
I arrive at the establishment which is a side door of a shop on neerim rd, carnegie which she advertises in her ad.
Ring the bell and to my surprise, a cute looking well spoken girl answers the door. Shes wearing tight leg-ins and a singlet. She is not fat or chubby, but well put together. I’m not good on giving boob measurements, but they would definitely be a good handfull if that helps you guys out. 
She introduces herself and leads me off into a side room which is perfectly set out for massage. 
Shower, clean towels, candles, soft music. 
So i know i'm in a legit place now, so i just do what she tells me, and enjoy the massage. She asks me to take all my clothes off and get on the table and she will be back in a moment. WAIT A MINUTE! Where's the towel to cover my ass? Cant see it on the table. Guess things might be ok here.
So i get starkus and lie face down waiting for her to return, which wasn't long after. 
She returns and ask if i was after a sensual lomi lomi.(sensual?). I say, "ok, why not". 
she does a wonderful massage and at this point i dont care if she's giving extras or not, just enjoy it i say. 
BTW! she did plenty of accidental rubbing and plenty of arse-crack oiling. I was enjoying it so much i fell asleep. She tells me to roll over, and i don't hesitate, and now I’ve got a roaring hard on looking straight at her.
I look up at her and she is staring down at my member as if she wanted to suck it dry, so i asked if she could help him get massaged as well. 
Now! gotta picture this. She places one hand on my cock and the other on my chest. Puts her face up towards me and says " i can do that for you," So I ask "How Much?". "It will be $50". Now this girl is very cute and all, but i declined for that price, as i think for that extra 5 mins of work, i'm better off doing it myself.
So i paid $70 for 45 mins and she wanted an extra $50 for a HJ, i know it sounds reasonable to most you guys but she declined to go nude and i thought that if i give in to that sort of money for a HJ then she will try to get me for more if i made any other requests. So i thought it might just give her a sense that it was a little over the line.
All in all, she is a very nice girl, both looks and personality, Clean and well presented establishment.
I will go back because i think that there is much more to this girl, and if she still keeps her prices up for extras, well i was very happy with her massage. Fucking awsome massage.
Maybe it was just me, but if the right guy goes there, I think they will be very happy. Just hope they share their experience with all of us boys here..
Happy punting guys.

I just gotta see if she would bring her price down slightly. Believe me. I wanted to throw my wallet at her but I thought, gotta stick to my guns, I'm sure when I go back she will reconsider her price.

I hear you bro. Perhaps you should return and sort out the cost of pricing on your Longfellow. 

I sometimes play a game with them and suggest they do the tug and perhaps nude up and I will give them what I think it is worth. 

That way you are in control and they become curious as to your evaluation of their skills. Needless to say they try harder and the result is way less mechanical than it might otherwise be. Not to mention you spend what you think it is worth. You might even suggest this is a first cause I never tip! As you peel them a grape/berry! 

Now of course it depends upon whether the money is paid up front or after the service. If the money is paid up front then if they are money hungry which is usually the case you observe them looking at where you got your money from and watch the eyes light up if you have an extra pineapple or two in your wallet. 

The realisation that you only have an extra orange or grape in your wallet will usually moderate the charge they ask as extra. If they are money hungry and they want what you have there is no point asking for something you don't have. Indeed it is a pointless exercise and this usually means they are more about the tease than the deed.

Now the other valuable lesson to learn here is never ask how much when she offers just say okay to the deed. If she doesn't suggest a price just say here is $20 for the tip. If she looks disappointed say sorry I would have given you $30 but that is all I have. Not  "sorry that is all I have on me" because the invitation might then be asked suggesting the hole in the wall might supply more. Then you are faced with a choice of never returning or visiting the ATM kicking yourself!
Remember always be deliberate with your communication and language. You can have a list of standard responses as they do to questions like "Do you do?" Or "How much have you got?"

BTW I always have extra hidden away in case I want to diss my rules and play anyway! Options are always great things to have. 

The old saying still applies here. Punt with your head not over it!   

Congratulations on a great review and some valuable insight into this lady. 


Biggus.

The problem is when you type Massage Pozitiva into google the link to this page is the 5th thing that comes up and the 10th thing is the auxxxreviews tweet about this place. Think about it, this isn't the sort of publicity she wants or needs in VIC. Is there not a way that auxxxreview can prevent results like this coming up in google? oh course people are going to type in their company name every now and again into google to see if there are any reviews about them, and if auxxxreviews is coming up on the first page of results when they don't want it to I can't see how this benefits anyone.

Unfortunately there are some real clowns in this fair city. I may be one   but I would never mention the forum to any Worker.

Not only is it bad form but it can make them run if they are newbies or indeed make them worry about the "law" and stop offering "services" that we folk on the forum punt and pray for. 

Some guys just don't understand the damage that can be caused in jurisdictions that outlaw certain services that are provided by unlicensed service providors. 

If the worker finds out about the forum inadvertantly or incidentally they usually take it in their stride and if they are worried they register as a sex worker and comply with the legal requirements. But PML's and other ML's should not have to worry about this shit and so the discussion should never arise and if it does dumb looks and pleas of ignorance work best. Don't go "Ohh Yeah well  the thing is!" Best pretend ignorance than become involved or embroiled in the what ifs conversations. 

So Nat if you are reading the forum don't worry your secret is safe. Your address is private and you are in total control of what you offer and what you do. Just do it well and smile knowing you are appreciated!

There certainly is some idiots out there.
So I go and see another newbie yesterday and much like my first review here everything looked like it was on the cards. She then says to me " why? You want to offer me a good review like the last guy?" So I play the dumb guy. " what do you mean? Review! I just saw your ad on gumtree. Explain what you are talking about.
She says that she had a client come in and ask for extras. She says she wouldn't do it as she didn't know him yet and he says! " if you do me extras i can write a review about you and you will get very busy".
Sorry if I'm blunt but! WHAT A FUCKHEAD!
Now this girl was sweet to say the least and she probably would have done me on my next visit because everything was looking good and we were getting along just fine. It's only because some idiot thinks he has power now and that we are all going to call her up and tell her what a great review we read about her.
Seriously. If you are the culprit who goes around saying this to these girls, then you must realize that you will scare them off and we will not have any punting to do and write about.
I find this fun and I have exchanged many details to what I think are a lot of genuine guys here who are out to do what I do, and find the holy grail. 
If you want to enjoy this for a long time, then shut your mouth and have fun. Don't tell these ladies that you are a critic and you are gonna make them rich off your review.
I'm not gonna mention who this new girl is because you won't get anything now. 
To all you genuine guys here. Happy punting..

Mr blackcat. Maybe I should make the forum invisible. Tell you what, next upgrade I will pay extra and build the forum out of unobtainium. 

I will remove it from all search engines and hide all the reviews and even our existence from all now non existent members that have less than 7 posts. 

Btw. I have a position vacant for a Director of Strategic development. It's a great role, you don't turn up for work and I don't pay you.

That is how forums work. 

Are you suggesting that I have to personally code every review because a service provider is operating outside of their license criteria. 

And I suppose that If went to their place and said "I don't like your light fittings" they should then service me for free?

Or am I now the protector for all chicks that pull dicks. I suggest we drop this line of conversation. If you knew what we do every day for these people you would be speechless.

I stayed with her on Monday. Great sensual lomi lomi, quite a few accidental brushes, but when I asked for extras at the end she said "who said there'd be extras?" with a cheeky smile. So she's either cautious and wants return customers or just plain out being a cock tease 

Planning on going back sometimes. However for $80 + $50 HJ (if she does offer it to me) I might as well go Tokyo Milk and see Sienna who does full nude HJ for $70...

Although Nat is pretty cute. REminds me of Emily Watson in her younger days.

All is does it fuck it up for everyone else, there is nothing gained from mentioning review forums. In fact I lost a regular massage girl as someone told her about this site and she now only does legit massages as she was way too scared shitless of being court or family finding out. If you cant communicate or negotiate extras with massage girls then that is your bad luck. DONT MENTION REVIEWS. END OF STORY.

Good post above. I got fronted by a ML ages ago talking about reviews and trying to work out if i had ended up there becuase of them.

 I just played dumb and got her to explain what the reviews were, agreeing with her about how bad it was. She got a little worked up and ended up dishing out a fiercely passionate rnt haha. Twas a worthy experience!

And no i didn't review her afterwards. That would be poor form.

Donk I am sure there was more to the ban than simple suspicion. The Mods and Administration only act I believe to protect the forum and to advance the reason why the forum exists. Natalie has the opportunity to join the forum as an industry worker for free. If she doesn't know then if she has the opportunity to join as an industry worker she can outline the facts of what she offers or does not offer. As a PML her address is never published and her safety is paramount.

I am uncertain if she just is not the full quid. As everyone knows it takes all types to make this world but some folks should never enter this industry.

Some are simply not mentally capable of doing some of the things that are sometimes required or encountered by working in this industry.

Now if you are not qualified, advertise slyly and ask top dollar it looks like what is on offer is simply not a vanilla rub.

I personally would not worry too much about this. As has been said before there are always plenty more opportunities out there. People do what they have to do. If you think about it we are all in the same boat. We work we earn money we eat pay mortgage or rent or live with someone who does either and or both.
We put our pants on one leg at a time (mostly) and we enjoy variety. Well most of the members do Save for some of us with a handle named Koo!

We punt we put out for the Gestapo and we all enjoy dining some at maccas some at the Y.

Try not to let anything said on the forum or indeed by any worker upset your day. Enjoy your punting and stay safe. Not everyone is cut out to be a worker and we all need to realise this and not have high expectations unrealistically.

Just a little anecdote. Once when I was having a sly root in a brothel in East Sydney I asked the worker ever so politely if I could talk dirty whilst doing the deed.
 She said yes of course no worries. Well after I have finished pumping her and was satiated I copped a shitload of abuse from her madaam. It appears she was clueless about what was agreed and the worker was offended by what i said. WTF??? I thought I had an agreement. It appears that consent is not always informed. Some are incapable of consenting so really should not be offering services of a sexual nature. It is as complex and as simple as that!
PM me if you need to talk. Meanwhile punt with passion and enjoy life to the full.

I have only just realised we assume that the review was meant for one of the sites such as AUXXX but I just realised or rather the penny dropped that I am pretty certain that this was not meant by the worker. Gumtree has its own reviews. I would probably say that this was the review that was being talked about.

Around 6 months ago Gumtree updated their software and site to enable reviews to be posted. I have posted some on there myself.
the thing is they won't allow you to post a suss review and the fact is that if Gumtree is alerted to any adult services being offered by posters who don't pay a premium they simply remove the ad. It is a free site but if you pay a small amount you can bulletproof your ad to stay on the site at the top of the search results.
So perhaps we should not always come with a guilty conscience and jump to conclusions as reasonable as they may appear.

Value/recommend? : Great for a massage

Made an appointment and visited at the agreed time to be greeted by a lovely smiling lady.  Stripped off and laid on the table to enjoy one of the best massages I have ever had.  She knew just the spots to work on and had a magnificent touch.  On the flip I bought up the subject of extras she gave an emphatic no I don't.  Upon pushing a little I got the feeling she might for repeat customers who she knew better but it was definitely off the agenda for now.  I suppose it might mean that the people above got lucky or she just didn't like me or she has been spooked by somebody.  Anyway if you want a fantastic massage then I highly recommend but anything beyond that is pot luck

I actually have received a tug from her, but only at her last place of employment.  I haven't seen her since she opened up in Carnegie though.  From the reviews thus far,  it seems you'll need some frequent flyer points to get to that RnT stage with her.  I've managed to get topless rub from her in the past,  so if you're that keen with her,  keep persisting.  Even if you have no success, her lomi lomi massage technique is still amazing to experience lol

Things may in fact have changed, but I'm guessing it's probably just if she doesn't know you. I'm fairly sure if a previous regular from Donnie or Camberwell made a booking, she would give the HJ service. If I get confirmation that it definitely is her, I would go and give it a try, and report back, but Anthony__9inch hasn't replied, despite the fact that he has been online at least a couple of times since he posted that he has received an HJ from her at her previous place of employment. So that makes me a bit sceptical.

Rates :60min-$80, + $50 HJ

Age: mid 20's

Size/shape : size 10

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian with a euro b'ground

Services Provided : lomi lomi, and HJ

Value for money/would I return - yes - great service

Fellas,

Been a few times and thought it was time to post.

This is the girl from Kew and Camberwell

Located underneath another business on ground floor. Pretty quiet still. Room has great shower for before and after if you like. 

Cute girl as described above. Wears black all the time, tights and little tight singlet top.

Massage is amazing nearly the best I've had. Always go for the Lomi Lomi. Uses strokes over and under the body. Feel awesome and plenty of touches and brushes when she is working the legs especially going under and over hammy/quad area. Spend half the massage hard as a rock ready to go.

On the flip the massage gets a little softer and more sensual. Always looks at me with her cute and devious eyes and asks if I want him rubbed. Of course I always ask what else...

Will give HJ and go top less for $50. Allows touching. 

Good technique good body great finish. Highly recommend you give her ago. 

Be quick she did speak of a holiday soon

Happy punting. Enjoy this one. Treat her good

Size/shape : size 10 - small/petite

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian

Services Provided : lomi lomi, relaxation remedial

Value/recommend? : Yes

Ok - it took a while but finally success!  Asked for extras and there was the options of HJ, topless HJ (can't remember the price on that one) or nude massage/hj for $80 (she charged me $150 total for the hour).  Once again it was a magnificent massage + a tad more sensual around the nether regions followed by a lomi style hj on the flip which was truly excellent.  Finished up with a shower and off I went.  So far she has been generous with her time - ie 1 hr massage = 1 hour of massage and not the 35-40 min that most try to get away with.  Highly recommended although she is on holidays for a few weeks till the start of December.  

I know most here are fine but just to spell it out for the few: Don't mess it up guys!  Be respectful, don't mention this site and if she says no after asking don't say that your friend (or whatever) says you do - just play it cool and think about how you are going to play it and try again next time (if you want to persist).

Value for money/recommend? : Good service but not sure about value for money

My experience/comments :

Have seen Natalie 3 times now and as others have posted she has to build some trust with you before offering anything extra. Very good massage every time and not a clock watcher.First two massages were pretty much the same and I did pop the question about extras both times, but she played me with a very straight bat both times..."we dont do that here", but she had a mischievious smile on her face making me think that there was still a chance in the future. The third massage was definitley more sensual than the first two...a couple of decent flicks of the boys this time. Hand job technique was excellent and she got me there quickly. Shower offered and accepted.
Good service from a nice lady but the price of $110 , for me, is probably a  bit too much for what it is. probably wont be returning but worth a try if you're in her area.

Services Provided: Massage only I'm afraid

Value for money/recommend?: Great massage but not at that price without any other inclusions

My experience/comments:

Hi all here is my first review on this site.

Natalie is a super friendly and obviously very qualified massage therapist.  She was very accommodating of my timing request (some of us have to work!) and made sure I felt comfortable from the moment I walked in.

While her massage (Lomi Lomi.....a real Lomi too with no towel underneath and plenty of oil) was exceptional.....including plenty of my hand resting between her thighs and brushing her lovely perky breasts more than a couple of times....it didn't really offer much else.

Her style is amazingly sensual and included regular touching of my balls while she was working on my inner thighs.  Even when she asked me to turn over and I was ready to fly a flag.....she just continued with the regular massage and didn't take it any further.  

I will try her again one last time as I could see plenty of boxes of tissues and wipes around which is generally a sign of more on offer.

If anyone else has been there and enjoyed any extras please let me know.

Thanks
ChongPow

Establishment : Massage Pozitiva

Date of Visit : 19/12/2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Purely DIVINE x Booking Essential x, Carnegie  (locanto ad)

Hours of Business : not sure what time she starts, but I know she doesn't work past 7pm

Rates : $70/45mins $80/hr + $30/$50 (hj/topless)

Age : mid 20"s

Size/shape : 8/petite 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Russian

Services Provided : lomi lomi + topless hj

Value for money/recommend? : I'm going with yes indeed

My experience/comments : 

What can I say, I had a very Pozitiva Massage with Natalie.

What started as lovely encounter at the front door (you have to ring a bell to be let in), she opened the door wearing a tiny pair of shorts and a tight black singlet top. We exchanged pleasantries, asked how each others day had been....blah blah blah

Asked me to strip, I asked underwear as well and she was like "Yep!"

She was facing the other way, but I caught her looking in the mirror as I went to get on the table. No covering on the table, it's just vinal which I though was odd, but became apparent later on.

Massage started and there was lots of oil used, long flowing strokes. She has a really great technique, probably one of the best I have experienced. She makes her way around your body, and then before it's time to turn she does some under body strokes on each side. Has no issue accidentally brushing the old fella, she hit mine plenty of time which I loved.

On the flip she asked how everything was going, I replied "Really Well"..... She started with the front of my legs and up onto my abs and chest, more accidental brushing of Mr Happy. This is when I ask if I was to give her a generous tip (wasn't going to be any more than $50 hj+nude) could she make it more sensual.

She asked what did I have in mind, I looked up with puppy dog eyes and she looked down and said "hand relief is $30" I smiled and agreed. She went back to massaging and then I piped up and asked if she would like to take off some clothes..... she smiled and said hj + topless will be $50. I was like "Yes Please"

Damn..... a really nice set of c cups, and nipples that just stood out. Touching was okay, but when I asked for a suck I got a giggle but a defiant NO.

Great technique, un-rushed plenty of ball play, she knows how to handle a cock. Would love her for a GF....lol
After the climax I got to use the shower. Now all clean and refreshed and empty I got dressed. Paid the young lady and was out of there.

$120 in total maybe a bit pricey for some, but I had a great experience and she is a beautiful friendly girl trying to make you feel your best. I would recommend for sure if you can afford it, and I noticed she responds well to politeness and respectful conversation.

 My experience/comments : Operates from a single room in Carnegie. Place looks like and office which has been converted to a massage room. Fitout is very nice. My experience was very similar to previous reviewer (Smooie). Gave a very good lomi style massage. This was my second visit so she went nude. She has a nice body - short and square shape but definitely not fat. 

On both visits I found she was a bit clinical. She has a bit of a sarcastic tone which is offputting. Handjob was good with just enough oil but too hard. 

I will probably not return again.

Rates:$80 for 45 mins

Age: mid-20s

Nationality or Ethnicity: Russian I think

Services Provided: Massage only

Value for money/recommend?: Great massage, best I've had in a while

My experience/comments:

Went and saw Natalie to relieve some surfing bruises and soreness. Great set up, really clean and you can tell she looks after the place. Started off on the back, moved down to legs which was awesome. The dreaded towel was on my arse the whole time but constantly falling off so I'm sure she had a good peek at the jewels. Flipped and kept going on legs and stomach. She then said that's it and went to wash up and I got up starkers. She turned and then said all ok whilst eyeing off the package. I didn't want to push it so remained respectful, even though she had a glint in the eye!! Will return

Went to see her today. Not as attractive as everyone is making out here. A little short and dumpy but OK.

Walked in and was straight up about extras as I paid and before I got undressed. 

She told me it's illegal, and how does she know I'm not from the council.

Anyway, I said I don't have the patience for return visits to find out.

She offered that I could leave and she kindly gave me my money back and I left amicably.

She's a cutie

Little chubby but amazing massage, as a straight out sensual massage nothing better.

Her extras are ok, not brilliant but hey the massage is amazing so just have the rub.

I don't think FS is on offer as I have asked numerous times.

$150 for naked is a bit steep cause she's nothing special, but massage and HJ worthwhile.

Hi Fellow punters & Gentleman, Natalie here. 

Thought I should comment to avoid any further disappointment or wasting of any persons time.

No extras are available, no matter how many times you visit or if you have visited in the past and claim to have received. 

Those looking for a therapeutic remedial, lomi lomi or relaxation massage are welcome. Please do not ask or expect anything further.

Thank you kindly Natalie

You know the old saying "You have to spend money, to make money?" A SWA doesn't cost much at all. Apart from that she can trade without a risk if being arrested and possibly get more clients. There is obviously a strong demand for massage with extras. A brothel exempt license for two girls would be the way to go IMHO.

To recent date we have scared Natalie, Shindu and Mary of Glen Waverley! All nice ML's who provide a lovely booking. All because some stupid punters and forum readers can't just be nice guys on the request for extras and have to try and oblige the ML's by saying an internet forum says its on the menu! Honestly, these ladies are of course mortified by the prospect of their service being splashed all across the WWW. I'm guessing the guilty parties are just readers and not regular contributors so if you guys are reading this, just settle and don't spoil it for all of us.

I've been told that a person who has a record of being a legal sexual service provider (has a PCA or SWA number) cannot enter the United States for example. They will not be given permission to enter to the country. 

If this is true or not, I am not sure but was told by a friend of mine in the industry.

I guess they have to find out somehow, but as someone mentioned, a lot of information is available on databases.

Rate: $80 hr

Age: 25+

Size - Petite

Nationality: Caucasian

Service: Massage, HJ

Value: excellent massage, don't expect much more

My Experience:

Went to get a Lomi Massage couple of times with Nat. The massage itself is excellent and in the end of them she offered some hand relief for $30.
$50 if you want her top off. It was awesome.

one of the sessions was at the date mentioned above 12/12/13.
Nat is short beautiful blonde girl.

she was dressed with tight cloths that shows her body.
we started with her giving me lomi face down which was great. We talked a bit but not too much. I actually focused on her hands touching me.

after 40 minutes I turned and she did lomi on my front, touching "by accident" some times.
I started touching her, she was ok. first her butt and then her boobs. She asked if I want more (30 for HJ and 50 topless).
I went with topless...was excellent. had a shower and say went of. 


after couple times, she stopped offering this and now massage only.

Establishment : Side door of shop on Neerim Rd, Carnegie

Date of Visit : 01/05/14

HoursofBusiness : Mon-Fri 10am to 7pm

Age: mid 20's

Size/shape : size 10

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian / Russian Mix

Services Provided : lomi lomi. 

Value/recommend? : Bit Expensive

I've been to this joint few times earlier as Natalie is beautiful and her massage is good. Didnt get any extras for the first few times but was lucky last time I saw her. The room is dark, perfect for my liking and has a shower too. I decided to go for the hour which was $90. She was wearing a black t-shirt with black leggings. I lay nude on the massage table and she started the massage which was lomi lomi style with lots of oil and over/under the body strokes. It was quite sensuous and relaxing. She has a good toned body and perfect sized boobs which she would accidentally brush against my body.
The whole experience was good. She asked me to turn over and didn't cover me at all and started applying oil everywhere and brushing my balls couple of times. Towards the end I popped her the question and she asked $50 for HJ. I happily obliged as I was hard even though knowing it was a bit too much. She is slow and takes her time to get started into stimulating my dick. I didn't complain as I was touching her. She didn't mind and allowed my to go under her t-shirt and bra. She wears loose half cup bra. I felt her nipples and also slid my hand down her leggings. To my surprise she didn't wear any panties. I was loving the whole experience and came shortly after.

 I've been to this joint few times earlier as Natalie is beautiful and her massage is good. Didnt get any extras for the first few times but was lucky last time I saw her. The room is dark, perfect for my liking and has a shower too. I decided to go for the hour which was $90. She was wearing a black t-shirt with black leggings. I lay nude on the massage table and she started the massage which was lomi lomi style with lots of oil and over/under the body strokes. It was quite sensuous and relaxing. She has a good toned body and perfect sized boobs which she would accidentally brush against my body.
 The whole experience was good. She asked me to turn over and didn't cover me at all and started applying oil everywhere and brushing my balls couple of times. Towards the end I popped her the question and she asked $50 for HJ. I happily obliged as I was hard even though knowing it was a bit too much. She is slow and takes her time to get started into stimulating my dick. I didn't complain as I was touching her. She didn't mind and allowed my to go under her t-shirt and bra. She wears loose half cup bra. I felt her nipples and also slid my hand down her leggings. To my surprise she didn't wear any panties. I was loving the whole experience and came shortly after.
 Over all a good experience but a bit pricey.

Thanks for the review smartbrad, Natalie was already on my list to get around to so I think I might try to see her sooner.

For some reason I had somehow confused her with the other place at 510 Neerim Rd which was probably a reason I hadn't been to see her yet.

After some great experiences here I decided to go back after not being in the area for some time.  I saw the reports she had stopped but had started again recently.  Well for me - no dice .  Still had an awesome massage but nothing else was on offer.  She was very polite about it but very firm.  Oh well.... another one bites the dust.  A very big "FUCK YOU" to whoever fucked it all up.

Value for money/recommend? : For the massage alone, yes

My experience/comments : This review has been posted elsewhere on the wide web.

Been a bit quiet for a while as I'm been flat out at work and then feeling under the weather.  Made a booking to see Natalie earlier this month for an hour Lomi massage.  Now after reading the thread on her I went in not expecting anything but a straight massage.  The massage itself was worth the visit.  I'm still wondering how guys who lucked out on getting any relief from her can badmouth her service and her physical appearance.  

With the massage itself, it's one of the better lomi massages I've had, she's a tease though knowing how to get you aroused and keeping you like that.  On the flip, I was standing straight as a flag pole which she popped a towel over.  The massage on my chest and legs still had me aroused that I popped the question about any extras.  She gave me a polite no and I took it at that.  At the end of the massage, she offered me either a towel down or a shower.  I opted for the towel down as I was in a rush to be somewhere.  

All in all, I went with no expectations of any extras so wasn't disappointed.  

WIR - yes just for the massage

Value for money/recommend? : 100%

My experience/comments : A bit pushed for time lads, but will try to give as much as I can.
haven't been for a little while so I thought I'd run the gauntlant and give Nat a call and see what she's up to these days.
Got an arvo spot, crusied on down and was in straigt away. Chit chat followed..... Seems as though things are a little quiet for the young lass, I was here last booking for the rest of the day and there was plenty of daylight left.
Proceed to strip off and jump up and that super comfy bed.
And it begins, massage is still the same quality that it has always been, could do with a little more accidental brushing of the goods when she is doing the under-body gear. The flip comes and it's time for the front to get a good oiling and stroked, plenty of accidental brushing of the old boy now i've flipped. So I give her the wink and ask the question. She offers up a little smirk and replies of corse! Then I ask, and chance you getting your tits out......wait, how about full nude?? She's like, if you are happy to pay then sure! I said, I'm happy tiger.... get your gear off 
Well now it gets good, full arm strokes up and down the body, feels fucking fantastic! I start to play with her boobs and then make my way down to her bum, I reach lower and go for the cat, and what do you know... access granted!! Now I work my way in a little and LOOK OUT pretty darn moist in there, I think someone is having fun also. Well this becomes all to much for me and I do my nuts. Game over.
The end is the norm, nice long hot shower and pay the gal and out the do with a right ol' spring in my step.
Good one Nat....we're back on track!!

As we all have different concept of bust size the only way for you to find out is to make a visit and see her. Give it a go and then you can provide a detailed reiew with all the metrics included.

There is a fair chance she is only providing the good stuff to regular punters and people she knows she can trust. There was someone blabbing about different forums in the past, which made her restrict what was being dished out. I may be only a one in handful of lucky guys who can still get the royal treatment. It did take my time when I started seeing her to bring up the 'extras' conversation; I think it was at least the 4th visit. I guess it's why we all need to remember that this and other forums are for our knowledge only and not to be used as bait or leverage. Good luck if you persist with Nat.

Its true Ron, Natalie stopped providing the service because she found the forum and read the revues. if you google Pozitiva it did send you straight to this forum. I don't believe anyone blabbed or tried to use the reviews as leverage to get extras. She still provides the service for regular customers. Maybe if you see her a few times and gain her trust you will get the same.

Value/recommend? : sort of. 

Called her yesterday, she didn't answer my phone but she called me back right away. Very friendly on he phone and booked a session within a short time. Arrived at the venue, as was greeted by her. Took the shower and then she came in. She is friendly but I guess she didn't like to have a chat with me. As asked for payment first and asked for $80 but as it was my first time and she advertised on her website she some discount is available so it was $65 for me. Gave me very therapeutic massage which was really good. Absolutely nothing sensual or no hints. After sometime she asked me to flip and she places a towel on me. I asked for a sensual massage and said I am not worrying about extra, but nothing changed. She still gave me very therapeutic massage, almost remedial. She finished and shower was available. Unfortunately she uses scented oil and her bodywash in the shower has floral smell. I don't enjoy either. Anayways, was a good massage at discounted price, but I guess I won't be returning.

Mate, long time no review. Your last one was in January 2016. Looks like you are scheduled for a membership downgrade in a few weeks so maybe you could post a review? If you have seen Nat recently a fresh review of her would be good as we have no reviews since May 2015.

My experience/comments : i have seen natalie many times over the last four or five years, but this review is based the last appointment i had with her few weeks ago.

she still charges $80 for the hour for her lomi lomi massage, but it's not as sensual as it used to be, it is more of a mixture of lomi lomi and remedial sort of massage now. 

and she doesn't do any nude services anymore. she charges extra $20 for a handjob and $40 for a topless HJ. 

i still recon she is one of the best value for money massage therapists in melbourne and i will definitely go back to see her

For what's it's worth, I visited Natalie today for a remedial massage. She is definitely a very capable remedial massage therapist and was not only able to relive most of the tension in my stiff muscles, but was able to describe all of the dysfunction in full anatomic detail. She would also have known, buy my comments and muscle issues that I was a legitimate remedial massage client. 

She required that I keep on my jocks on (fairly standard for remedial)..  After working the back, glutes, thighs etc (and jocks back up) she flipped me over (towel on) and worked on my grojn abductors (which needed serious work). By then young BIll was forming a little tent which I'm sure she saw. I had also given enough hints about enjoying soft and sensual as well as remedial etc etc. but once the abductors were done, the hour was over and I was on my wat.

Conclusions:

- She is a very good remedial massage therapist and if you need some serious work, you could do a lot worse than to pay her a visit. Extras are (apparently) standard fare; although they might be for less formal treatments such as Lomi Lomi - but if that was what I was after I would go elsewhere.

- I would suggest that we respect the professionalism of her (very professional) primary business. I will pay her a visit from time to time for an excellent remedial massage. Anything else that transpires per chance will be between myself and the lady.

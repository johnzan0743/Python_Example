My experience/comments :

I have never had “Geisha Bodywork” before, so I thought that I would try it out.


  I text Michelle, and the massage is $200 for around 70 minutes, which includes shower time, before and after the massage.  

  For $200, I was expecting quite a bit.  

  Michelle informed me that she would be nude as she performs the massage, so hopefully I was going to get more than just the usual hand relief.

  Michelle is attractive and friendly.  Her place is quiet and relaxing.

  After showering and lying on a mattress, Michelle did an okay massage, but it wasn’t anything special.  There was plenty of teasing, and she taught me some breathing techniques which would give me more “staying power”, but the massage didn’t reach any new heights.

  There is a lot of touching of the genitals, and at the end, she finally let me climax.  It was good, but it wasn’t worth $200.

  Michelle did say that she could give "more" if I saw her again, but "more" would mean a higher cost.
After that experience, I wasn't coming back for "more".


  $100 to $130 would have been okay, but $200 is over the odds.

  I would not recommend her for the price she charges, but she is quite friendly and she means well, so it wasn't a complete waste of time.

You said at the end she let you explode. Does that mean she keeps pulling you off feeling you get close and stops?

Yes.  She is trying to build up the sensation.

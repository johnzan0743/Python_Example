 My experience/comments : (Please put some effort into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

After a small review over on another forum, I popped into this suburban house and was met with Christina. She is a very short little Thai lady, very sweet and quite cute. The house is very clean and you get to shower in a very nice bathroom before and after. 

 I opted for the 45 min session r'n't which only cost $100!!! I prefer teasing and tickling to firm massages and before long she knew what I liked and her skills in delivering were awesome! Much of the session was spent teasing the sensitive areas to the point of trembling, then relaxing for a few breaths and then back to the action; intervening with the occasional twisting hand-job tug. All in all, I had a highly sensitive boner for the entire 40 minute session, and was close to cumming several times, before she went back to the body-trembling teasing. She also accompanied this with a body-slide, her long hair and pointy nipples teasing me across my back. A few nibbles, kisses and heavy breathing around the neck and ears kept me throbbing downstairs.

 It was an excellent session, I'll definitely be back. She also had a friend working there too, Amanda, taller and with a great pair. 

 I recommend this experience, as it certainly catered to what I like!

Interesting..., thanks for the review.
Don't happen to know if either of them also does legit massages at Leelawadee Thai Massage in Clarkson?
I have had some wonderful massages there with a Thai lady called Ae, who said she live swith her sister on Beechboro rd.
Would love to try her massage out of the office if it is her?

Who knows? It is a suburban house, so anything's possible. Is she a little shorty?

My experience/comments:
I have been travelling lately and was in Perth.
After a hard days of work I needed some relaxation so I called a few numbers from the newspaper I bought.
Her ad says “ relaxing body massage by sexy mature lady Victoria park 0404-566-856”
Called her and the appointment was set
Finally arrived at a townhouse on Albany Hwy closer to a coffee shop. entry was from the side street.
Townhouse was private, clean. Shower was offered, the shower was clean & had pump soap.
The bedroom had built in with large mirrors which was a positive.
My first look at her she looked slightly older with an olive skin. But I was too tired to be bothered to find another place. So decided to stay.
She changed into a beautiful red lingerie!!!!! And started massaging… so I asked her when does the cloths come off.. she took the dress of and that’s the time I saw my monies worth…  the boobs were so beautiful.. I haven’t seen a nice set of boobs like that since my 22 year old ex-girlfriend I had in my days. They were big naturals but not saggy at all. I was pleasantly surprised.
Pussy was shaven , flat (not bumpy). She was trying to upsell me a full service but I was too tired.  I said another time.

But she ended up giving me a really good massage, which was very nice.
Then moved into a HJ. Once I finished she offered a shower again.  All in all it was a good punt.
Came downstairs and saw an old lady… could be a friend or relative, don’t think she was working so I didn’t ask.

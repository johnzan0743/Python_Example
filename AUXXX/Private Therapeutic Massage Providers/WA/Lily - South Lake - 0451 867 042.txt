Massage -$60
HJ - $50
No other services

I was in a search for something and more private in an area so Pain Relief sounds promising. Actually there were no pain but pressure definitely was built 
appointment has been  booked by txt. Direct request for "nude? Extras?" had been replayed with "YES". So far so good.
I had arrived in time just to find empty house. Call lady and got answer - back in 2 minutes. After good 10 minutes when I was ready to leave she finally has popped up. 

Mid 30, good slim body, B boobs. 
Services discussed - nude massage, DATY and full access for $150. A little bit over standard$120-130 for this service but I was still in good mood. 

No shower offered... But massage table instead of saggy bed. Massage start with some hard unsystematic pushes. Light chat - from HK, house rented, not married, no boy friend..,
After some pressure she undressed to underwear ( did you call this NUDE?)

Long story short - crapy 1/2 hour massage. Flip over - after real pressure the rest of gear was finally removed. Straight to tug . No DATY. tNot bad but after few minutes she get angry - she's tired, she's  never go it nude in 10 years in biz (WTF) and so on and she just ... Left a room. She came back in a couple minutes and start to build up a pressure and all this right  staff from a book " how to make this bastard cum" . 
But a general feeling of spoiled moment was in the air...
all came well finally and jizz was  wiped out with napkins . She left for jot towel and came back fully dressed. She promised next time she will do better. Shower on request. 

Summary - overpriced 59/50 massage with more or less acceptable tugging. 
WIR - may be. For reduced price, no nude, no DATY. Biggest pros - single Lady in empty house. No overcrowded MP with paper walls between.

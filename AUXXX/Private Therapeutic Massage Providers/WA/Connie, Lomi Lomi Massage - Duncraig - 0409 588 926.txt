Connie also sends wonderful texts describing her giving Magic Treatments with her loving hands, whilst also ensuring that you know she is not a RnT massager. Lots of her clients (male and female) "help themselves" at the end of the massage, which she does not discourage, and I must admit the feelings are so wonderful that you could quite easily help yourself.

The massage itself is full of long, flowing, under and over strokes during which no area is off limits. Although she does not actively play with your tackle, there is a lot of incidental contact which is thoroughly enjoyable. It was literally the best massage I have ever had, even without the tugging part.There is an abundance of oil used which means your whole body is slippery and alive. Even two days later I am slipping back into the zone as I write this.

For those of you in Perth, I can highly recommend this as one of the most sensual feelings you will ever have.
It is a highly sensual, erotic massage which has the happiest of happy endings- you will feel blissed out for ages- and horny as hell also. 

Enjoy!!

I saw here a few weeks back. Great service, although she was a bit under the weather after coming back from hospital.

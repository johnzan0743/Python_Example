My experience :  

Feeling a bit toey today so checked out a few private ladys in the Bulletin, about 3or 4 didn't answer nor did they call back and a couple of others it turned out I had seen before with not so memorable results, so gave them a miss. anyway I got onto this gem I checked and couldn't find any reviews on her, so I went in blind, I'm glad I did, when I rocked up I was greeted at the door by an attractive Thai lady, was ushered into a spacious and clean room with a table set up in the centre, a shower running off it and low relaxing music playing. Got the financials out of the way and on with the massage. She provided a firmish relax massage(she would go harder or softer if asked) which I found to be very much to my liking. This went on for 20 or 25 mins with not a lot of touching accidental or other wise, but it wasn't long before the tease began. She is very good at this, she was reaching under and giving all the tackle a very pleasurable once and twice over, whilst doing this she was putting a lot of work on the freckle which was most enjoyable(she didn't actually insert a finger but at times it felt like she penetrated just a little. Was asked to turn over and oiled up the mongrel and into the tug. Her tug technique wasn't the best I've had but having said that it certainly wasn't the worst, during the said tug she kept up the work on and around the ring gear. All in all the whole experience was worth the time and money spent. Oh I didn't mention that on the turn she dropped her top and let the pups free, however, she was very shy of any touching she either kept or moved out of range whenever the hands started to wander. I didn't ask if any other extras were on offer, but somehow I don't think so, but, I have been wrong before. After the tug was out of the way she went on and completed the massage for about 20mins, then it was into the shower and on my (very) merry way. 
Would I return?  Yes, but after I've seen a couple more from my bucket list.
I called her a gem earlier in the post, she is, even though her hand job wasn't the most earth shattering experience it was very good, she is attractive and friendly has reasonable english and is good at what she does. So I guess she ticks the main boxes.

I don't have much to add to Caybee's comprehensive description above, but I whole heartedly agree with his review.  I found this lady to be quite attractive, very friendly, and nice to talk to.  SHe doesn't talk much during the massage, but after the tug while "cleaning up" we had a good chat, as well as after I got out of the shower.

As Caybee reported, not the best tug I've ever had, but that might be because of the angle while she stays on target rubbing the backdoor while tugging.  The build up was nice.  Manie has a nice way of playing with the date which was very enjoyable.  It feels like she runs the tips of all 4 fingers across your bum hole, but never really penetrates.  Oh, she didn't offer to release the puppies, but I did pop one out myself and had a little play with her nipple - nice.  She didn't seem to mind.

So yeah, other than that, pretty much as described by Caybee, and a very enjoyable punt.  I'll definitely be back.

Value/recommend : Yes/Yes for the massage, not the HE

Nothing new of note to report with this one.  I was after a proper massage to go with my HE, so I gave Manie a call.  In the past she has had a blanket policy about not taking short notice appointments, but this time I got in within the hour, only because I've been to see her before I reckon.

Routine was pretty much a carbon copy of my previous visit.  Manie's massage skills are very good, and once again I found myself on the verge of nodding off.  She still does the same work on the ring to get the HE part started, and I must say this does feel good.  Flipped over and got an average HJ to completion.  I'd say this is where Manie falls short, because her skills in this area certainly don;t match how she works the rest of your body.  It's a case of finishing up pretty much as soon as the first spurt hits her hand.  I figure I'm like most guys who like the girl to keep stroking until you're all done.

Anyway that's about all there is to say.  Still good value at $80/hr with HJ thrown in.  Clean, tidy place with a shower to get the oil of before heading home.  I probably won't be returning any time soon though - too many other options with not enough time/money.

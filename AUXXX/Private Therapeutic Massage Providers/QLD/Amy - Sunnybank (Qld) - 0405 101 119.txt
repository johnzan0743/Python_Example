My experience/comments :Has some time on my hands & this was the first add I messaged to reply. Booking was easy & her house easy to find with a lot of available on street parking. Met at the door by Amy wearing not a lot & hi heels. Into the room, handle the finances then strip off & onto the table. Got an extremely good very deep massage. This lady is obviously a professional massage therapist, she worked out a lot of kinks. Eventually time for the flip & was greeted with her hot body with just the tiniest little lingerie crop top hiding her small boobs. Her nicely shaved pussy was on full display & ab=vailable for fondling. DATY for a an extra 20. 
Left very happy & would recommend her. I would even go back just for the massage, regardless of the bonus HE.

As always YMMV.

Thanks cjh...Amy sounds like a nice find. Dont forget to add a phone number in future, especially if you're starting a new thread. Phone numbers in links disappear when ads are removed or expired etc and then we are up the creek if we want to book.

My experience/comments : I have visited Amy more than once and always found her massages to be very good & firm. Latest visit:- Made booking by phone & luckily Amy was available at a suitable time. I arrived on time & was met at the door with a friendly hug & was led into the massage room. As usual got the finances sorted first up. As normal whilst stripping down Amy enquired if any areas needed extra attention, proper firm massage attention that is. She does a good very firm / hard massage which really frees up the muscles. Then into the massage on her wide table. Yes clean towels always seem to be used. A bit of a tease during the massage, but for Amy massage is massage, the fun comes after. 
Upon the flip I get an eyeful of here lovely long nipples & cleanly shave box. She has a nice slow finish technique which I find very enjoyable, then clean up, a bit more chat & leave.
In summary a much better massage than one would normally expect, but be warned it is a very firm massage, not a light rub. A good finish generated by a lady who has a very presentable body & doesn't mind having it touched & enjoyed.

Default Amy - Sunnybank, Qld

Person's Name : Amy

Establishment : ML Res

Date of Visit : August 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : http://brisbane.locanto.com.au/ID_14...-Relaxing.html

Hours of Business : 10 to 10

Rates : 100/60 min inc

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Value for money/recommend? : Meh

I was coming up from Melbourne on business in the Sunnybank area and Amy sounded like a good option at the end of the working day. What's not to like about "MILF-Mature-Lady-with-Big-Boobs"?

I rang a couple of times to confirm availability and fix an appointment. I used my best chatty, friendly voice (which normally works well to set up a relationship with MLs)and got a gruff business-like response. Well at least I can't complain because that was pretty much how the session went.

So yes Amy strips off first thing and yes she has large titties, but she insists you stay face-down through the massage phase and "no touching. you can do that when you roll over" (which would end up being a long time in the future.

To her credit, Amy does give a firm massage but I can assure you that she is not trained. Any of the girlsat Thai shops, or even the shopping centre Chinese joints would have more technique.

Anyway, after bashing and rubbing for 40 minutes or more, she started this complex process of removing the oil from my back with paper towels (rather rough and uncomfortable), washing down with hot towel, then covering me up with a towel again and starting five minutes or more of the "tom tom" treatment up and down my back and legs.

On the flip, I could massage her substantial titties and prominent nipples but, "no sucking. Only for full service? And no access to the cat.
To give her credit. the HJ. together with a very firm prostate massage which I requested were professional and led to a quite satisfactory conclusion. 

In conclusion. I should have booked 20 minutes and saved the $40 extra - and not gone in with a thought of long sensual massage and cheeky talk. Damn those really good (and rare) MLs. They leave you with high, and generally unfulfilled, expectations!

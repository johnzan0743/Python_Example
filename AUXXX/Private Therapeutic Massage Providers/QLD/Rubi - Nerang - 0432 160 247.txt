My experience/comments : I had been seeing Rubi's ads on Locanto over the last few weeks, pricey full service, looking for a sugardaddy, massage with a lot of expensive extras, advertising that it was her nineteenth birthday etc. My curiosity got the better of me and I gave her a call, she answered and all sounded good over the phone, she sounded quite nice, perhaps a little jaded, i said I would come over for the $100 half hour.

I turned up at her less than average premises, and was ushered in to the house by a youngish lady, looking rather under the weather, and I tried to make some excuses to leave.  She wouldn't hear of it and so started the rollercoaster ride that would last the next half hour of my life. It was a bit like a scene out of Houso's, but anyway, in for a penny, in for a pound.

The massage table was really low to the ground, and the room was decorated in, well, mess, and a couple of Aussie flags, strewn clothing etc, but anyways onto the massage.   Rubi removed her top and pants, grabbed some olive oil, and dumped it on me, pushing it from side to side whilst I wondered how many showers I would need to remove the oil from me, and how many times I would need to wash my clothes to get rid of the sopped up olive oil.  She is not an unattractive girl, however she does like to talk about all sorts of unfortunate things, mostly that have happened to her, or her friends, or her family.  This did not help set the mood for a fun time, I started to think to myself, has it really come to this.

After about 20 minutes she asks, would I like a body slide?  $50 extra, so I said no, she seems a little surprised, but already in for $100 for what was really just an olive oil bath, and really all i wanted to do was get out of there. I was asked to turn over and then was told the old $50 to touch, which she did explain was in her ad, in a way that certainly was killing any of the mood that was left in me.  At this point, a little shocked, i asked about other extras, oral $100, plus a couple of other extras that could have put me in for a $300 half hour massage in the back blocks of Nerang.

She got to work on me, seemingly put out that there was no extra cash to be made, quite halfheartedly, explaining that most real men are happy to pay the extra, that she was worth it and all I could do was just explain that to me, it wasn't what I was wanting to spend my money on, and that the sooner it was all over the better for both of us.  Surprisingly, I did finish up, and headed to the worst shower in history to try and remove some of the oil that had made its way into every square inch of me. Not much luck in that, so I just dressed, left and made my way home to begin a oil removal not unlike the job that needed to be done after the Exxon Valdez fiasco.

I can look back and laugh at this whole thing because I only wasted $100 but I guess that's why its called punting, and I have had pretty good luck lately, and this was really just a reminder that every punt isn't going to be a good one, as just because someone sounds good on the phone doesn't mean it will pan out that way.

Sorry, i thought putting in the phone number, and that she advertises on locanto was enough. What else do you need on there? thanks

LOL - I know that feeling.  Don't these girls/massage parlors consider that most of us have wives to go back home to?!?  You'd think that light unscented oil would be a friggin easy decision for them by now.

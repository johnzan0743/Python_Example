My experience/comments:  Seems my suspicions were correct that the 2 quite similar ads in the GC BUlletin (Nerang and Helensvale) are run by the same people.  I last saw this lady at the Gold Coast Holiday Park on Siganto Drive (see previous review). I was going to Nerang for some variety, but ended up with Kiki again... not that I'm disappointed at all.

Pretty much the same deal as last time.  Nice clean motel room. Strip to lay on bed.  HJ first before massage.  I controlled the pace for a while, slowing her down if I got too close.  She was sucking on my nipples making the most sexy slurping noises and it felt great. This time she seemed more open to me touching her, but I didn't overstep the mark and kept to her but cheek and tits.  Eventually when I blew, she was laying so close to me I reckon I got her on the side of her tit, but she certainly didn't seem to mind.

She went off to wash her hands then came back to give me a VERY relaxing Thai style (no oil) massage.

Overall very good value for money.

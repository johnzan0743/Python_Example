My experience/comments : 

Holly is out of the way approx 30 minutes from Surfers at Nerang. Her residence is off the Nerang road in the bush.
She is very chatty and I would say a BBW but definitely not offering anything other than a decent massage.
She has a sauna (Only God knows why) which she is keen on getting working. Along with any takers into it. Suggesting she needs it to pay for itself. She gives a very thorough firm massage. Strictly therapeutic with the possible suggestion if you became a regular she might be persuaded to do a little more but ATM probably no way. Some of these gals give off signals that confuse us mere male mortals!
I go by the notion where there is life there is hope. Always on the lookout for adventure.
She is a good looking gal whilst she is carrying her extra weight well and with a great set of tatts and titts. She uses a grade of oil which is used at the topend dayspas so the experience is rather pleasant. She was a punt that I was not certain anything else was on offer and I wasn't disappointed as nothing else was on the menu. Oh well plenty of other numbers to check out.

Overall I would say a good massage worth the trip to experience but not if you want your tackle tickled.

Biggus.

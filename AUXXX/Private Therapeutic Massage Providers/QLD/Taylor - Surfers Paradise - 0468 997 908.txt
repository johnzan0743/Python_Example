My experience/comments :  I was looking to spend some time with an Aussie massage lady, and over the phone she sounded good, and was available at short notice.  I found some free parking near the Q1 and called her, to her less than immaculate apartment block, realising this was probably not going to be the best, however I was keen to get a massage so I soldiered on.  I made the call to get the number and was given instructions as to where to go and was inside within a minute.

Taylor was very tanned, bleach blonde and looked very much, to me anyway, like an extra from an Eighties motley crue video.  Into the bedroom, massage was to be on a bed, a very flimsy bed with a mattress that was also very flimsy.  It was a very average back massage with talcum powder,with a little bit of tackle play, and a short halfhearted body slide before being told to flip. This was about 10 minutes in and i was just happy for it to be over with asap, no chemistry was there at all, and I am sure it was the same for her.  The hand job was over fairly quickly, without much finesse, with me closing my eyes and thinking about someone else, if you get my drift!

Out the door after a shower and back to my car in 20 minutes.  I shouldn't complain, just brings me closer to a good one!

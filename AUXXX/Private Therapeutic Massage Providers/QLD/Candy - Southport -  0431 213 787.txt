My experience/comments:

Up on the Gold Coast on holidays saw this ad on locanto. 
The photos looked great and she guaranteed me they were real otherwise I dont pay. So i took the punt and headed to Southport where Candy operates from a private apartment. Looks like she lives there. 
I was greeted at the front of the apartment by a gorgeous asian girl in a tight fitting mini dress. I thought wow this could be great. 
We went up to her apartment and I stripped off and lay on the massage table. She returned and stripped off to reveal a great body with nice but smallish tits. 
She got me to lay on my tummy first and started a light massage on my back. 
This lasted for less than 5 mins and she started with her extras. 
$50 for touching or $100 for a fire and ice natural head job. 
I couldn't resist and went for the fire and ice oral. 
She left the room and quickly returned with 2 glasses, one with hot water and one with cold. 
She then gave a very nice blow job first with fire then with ice. She didn't want me to cim unless I paid another $50. So I shot my load all over myself. 
She then cleaned me up and it was all over in 20 mins. 
She is great looking and gave a good blow job but it was all very clinical, there was no erotic build up or tease. 
For that reason I wouldnt see her again. But if you are after a nice fire and ice blow job from a hot Taiwanese girl then she is worth it. 
The photos in her ad are real.

My experience/comments:

Hi all here is my second review on this site. I went and saw her the other day, got a really good massage. Thai and oil massage, though she was fully clothed and around her mid 30's, charged $60 an hour but I was able to get it for $50. It was a good massage, though she knew little english and while I was getting the massage, the door to the room was open and there was another girl just walking around outside. Asked about extra's but she didn't really know what I was talking about, though she did mention extra for rnt later on which had me really confused. It was a good massage so if that's what you are looking for, then I'd suggest her, managed to completely relax my back and shoulder which had been really tensed up. Though the oil she used had a strange smell to it that kinda lingered and slightly smelt of vomit (to me anyway).

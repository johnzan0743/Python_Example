My experience/comments : 

Repost in the correct template.

Hello all, first review under my new handle after several years off the forum.

First of all Immy is far better looking in real life than represented in her photos. She can be a little flaky but has never disappointed nor missed an appointment.

Immy is beautifully proportioned, great figure and well endowed. She is a lovely woman once you talk to her and is very normal, just struggling like most of us to make life as good as it can be.

Immy's service is great - fantastic kissing, oral that is out of this state, great body to hold. I recommend you take the shower option with her as it is a great experience to have her on her knees in the shower looking up at you. I have seen Immy several times over the last few years in a couple of different locations and all were fine. Usual access issues for most apartment buildings. I usually take the shower, massage or mutual oral stuff as I rarely go full service and just prefer the rest of it.

$320 for an inclusive hour is reasonable value for me as she is what she says she is and her warmth is fantastic. I have done the $200 30min shower and oral treat a couple of times as well when rushed and recommend this as a great taste tester.

What else can I say? Look after her and she will be great to you.

Good luck to all.

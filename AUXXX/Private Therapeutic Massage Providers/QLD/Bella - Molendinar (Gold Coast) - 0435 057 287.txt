My experience/comments : 


Found myself with a couple of hours of free time yesterday, so, of course decided to indulge in a little punting relaxation. Trolling through the Bulletin and found Bellas add, rang and organised a time. arrived at the appointed hour. Her house is easy to find,she is in a street off crestwood dve, behind the Ashmore Bunnings store. I was greeted at the door by a Chinese lady around the ages stated above,she is no stunner,but not ugly either,probably what one would expect for someone her age. Anyway was ushered into the room, it was very clean with the table set up in the centre. Established how long I was there for(1hr), got the financials out of the way and on with the massage.I opted for a medium/soft pressure. Now the massage was quite enjoyable, with a little more pressure than I am used to,but not super hard and penetrating.We chatted a little during the back massage, She told me she was trained in massage in China,(I think this showed in her massage ability) and that she has been in Australia (and on the Gold Coast) for 8 years. When asked I was informed she has only been operating here for about 3 mths. and nowhere before that. As I said the massage was quite good, when she progressed to the legs there was no positive touches on the sensitive areas, a couple of accidentals,so,I guess I didn't know for certain if I could expect anything more.(I hadn't asked about the ending prior) The leg massage went on for a few more minutes, she then started a light,feathery rubbing of my back, legs and all massaged areas. It was then that the tickle and tease began(Phew!!!). By this time I had my arse in the air: firstly, to give her better access and secondly because it was too uncomfortable to lay down. She saw my dilemma and asked if I would like to roll over, which I did, gladly. It was then she put the question to me. Of course I accepted(there was no mention of extra payment, so I wondered if it was included in the price). She got on with the job at hand, and she was very adept at this discipline also. I held on for as long as I could,but,eventually had to release the Taddies. After the pleasantries were over she then got on with it and completed the massage session ( after a clean up of course).It was after I was dressed and handing over the money($60) that she informed me it was an extra $20 for the HJ. No problem.... I expected it anyway.
Al lin all it was quite a pleasurable experience, I will probably return at a later date, but in the meantime there are others I would like to try before I do.
I forgot to add; she didn't mind me rubbing her bum and rubbing/playing with her pussy (outside her underwear) during the HJ.
Also at the end of the session she stripped the towels of the table and wiped it down with a damp cloth, before replacing with clean ones. I guess that's a plus.

gcbloke, Might I suggest that you use the LIKE button at the lower Right hand side of the post rather than words. Saves a lot of space and time.

I did at the time...I'm not sure what you mean about wasting time? Is it not the done thing to verbally respond to a review as well as click the like button? If it isn't the done thing...then you have my sincerest apologies :/

If you like as Review just use the LIKE button.

Now you said "Thanks for the review...might be worth a visit " So you are not sure whether you will visit, just "might"  so just make a decision , visit and then write your own full Review using the Template. It does not really add anything (and more importantly it does not advance your ranking if that is what you think) adding that you might do something.

You are very new and I was just letting you know what we expect. So if you really mean you will, rather than "might" see her, I suggest that you ring Bella, make an appointment and then post your full Review using the Template. The more meaningful Reviews members provide then the better understanding members have of the type of experiences available.

Another thing I would like to draw all new and existing members to is the requirement of maintaining their membership. For Bronze members the requirements of maintaining your Bronze membership:-

You must continue posting complying Reviews to maintain your Bronze satus and I refer you to our rules on this, listed in Item #1 of the section http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f39/me...ivileges-8318/.

The relevant section is *To maintain membership status, you need to post at least Four (4) acceptable reviews per year. Comments are not counted.

Regards, Wotan010

Back for my holidays and the first day back work, I was feeling stiff from all the tourist shenanigans so I wanted a proper massage. I had seen Bella a year ago but never got around to reviewing her. I was in the neighbourhood but didn’t know if she was still working so quick text/reply and I found myself at her home. Now first up, the last couple of times I’ve been here I’ve bumped into her partner which was chill but it may scare off other punters. I think I was more weirded out by her small dog looking at naked me than her hubby. Now, Bella has a massage room which has a shower and AC which was a relief on a hot leap year day. I would describe Bella’s massage to be very strong and I’m pretty sure she could’ve gone harder had I asked which I definitely didn’t. Her style reminded me of Kandi of Moorooka Health & Beauty who I regularly visited years ago without all the sexy extras. I actually had to ask her to tone in down as I wasn’t use to it anymore. As the massage was winding up, part 2 starts with Bella running her nails on my back and privates which was a divine contrast to her strong kneading earlier. Alas, she doesn’t go beyond offering HE as I’ve fantasised about her nakedness but she was ok with me touching her. The HJ wasn’t the best but I still came pretty heavily nevertheless. If your after a good hard massage and aren’t spooked by the prospect of seeing her partner than I recommend giving Bella a try. The only mistake I made was seeing her in beginning of the week as I was sore a few days later.

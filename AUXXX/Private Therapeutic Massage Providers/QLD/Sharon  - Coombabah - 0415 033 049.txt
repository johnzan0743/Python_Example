I'm sorry to bug you all, but this advertisement has been driving me crazy. 

I have seen this lady's ads plastered all thoughout the Internet including, Locanto, Gold Coast Directory and No Flies and even the GC Bulletin, however due to her limited working hours and her ceasing to work on a Saturday (which was only ever by appointment to begin with), I have never gotten the chance to see her. 

For your convenience I have included a link to her Locanto page. She sure as hell sounds promising enough especially for those gents that prefer an aussie girl with great english and what i could assume to be a killer set of cans. 

From what I have gathered,it seems that she offers a naked massage with body slides for the hour for $110. She has texted me for an appointment (which she later had to cancel on me for), stating that more is revealed during the message. Only God knows what this could mean though. 

At the current time she has told me that she is not working Saturdays which means she only ever works when im at work, and before I have to resort to taking a day off 'sick', I would like to know if someone has seen her and what are their thoughts on the matter cause given how much she advertises, surely one lucky or unlucky punter has ventured where my manhood hasn't ventured before. 

If anyone could help, this would be greatly appreciated!

Ah yes, the talkative can be a turn off everynow and then especially when you want to relax. Would you mind divulging into whether she included anything outside the ambit of the standard RnT?

Ah yes gcme (Gold Coast Massage Enthusiast) the talkative type. Perhaps we could start a thread on the most talkative punts in the biz. I recently had a little under an hour with the talkfest queen not in New orleans  Suz from Macgregor in the ACT you know the King of the Kids Kevvies new place of residence.
Talk about needing a pair of sox. If they don't get the point about the "Sounds of Silence" you can say "listen if I want to listen to someone I would simply go home and listen to the Missus I am here to relax!" If they don't get that then get up off the table ask for a refund as " 'sorry honey' this just isn't working for me!" I need to go to the pub where it is quieter!  geez what is it with these gas bags. I feel like giving some of them an invoice for counselling services at the end of the sesh. Perhaps we could start a thread titled "the sounds of silence ! GOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRWWWWWWWWWWWWWNNNNNN!!! "
 Just a thought!

Some people like a bit of a chat, mate. It's not hard to let the ML know that you want it nice and quiet. No need to just lie there being passive aggressive, heh. You are paying for her time so don't be shy to speak up about what you want.

Me passive agressive. Pfffttt Sorry you  must be projecting. BTW I am not your "mate' that is reserved for those who go through life being respectful of others.

Ml's who are trained know when to ask about the pressure being applied and other pertinent relevant questions some of which should be asked before the massage commences. 
I am for the mostpart seeing them for relaxation not a counselling session. Those that constantly chat have no idea or clue. They also almost without exception are lazy at massage or incompetant and try covering this up with distracting talk.  All courses given with professional quals diploma or certificate suggest that silence or background music is best to set the scene for a massage. its called atmosphere.

The ones i have an intention to review for the first time i am on my front trying to remember the massage. Sure its not that relaxing staying awake to remember what i am going to put in the review. Those that cannot help themselves and do not shutup mostly cannot perform a decent massage hence the chatter. They are the types that cannot walk and chew gum. Most of us go to see a PML for relaxation not consultation or counselling. 

Of course it is your choice if you are happy to attend those with poor massage skills and plenty of talk. Don't forget to post as Wingman has done so those of us who bother reading and reviewing can get the picture and avoid these types.

You should not however project your amateur psychology onto someone with insight. Especially as you have no clue about me. However if you suggest that I am backward in coming forward you would be incorrect. I have no problem telling a ML what I need want and desire. The chatterboxes simply just don't listen. They are the people with poor listening skills because it is all about them.

Most of us that punt either are pressed for one or two things such as time and or money. This forum is about in one sense giving other members the heads up on who represents value who the timewasters are and who mostly are a waste of time effort and money.

If you want to know who offers the best massage and or extras whilst listening nurturing and caring about you the person then the list is probably single digits.

If you really are aware of your wants needs and desires then why not post a review it appears that you don't follow the forum rules.

BTW STOP STALKING ME. Do not post or feel the need to comment or respond to this post. In fact i and others would prefer if you simply used the forum for posting reviews instead of commenting and behaving like a troll.

There that proves there is no passive agression in me. As you suggested I have spoken up now read it and start behaving. This thread is for reviewing not attacking or sniping others who you have decided are smarter than you.

Person's Name : Sharon

Establishment : Private Unit

Date of Visit : Friday 30 August 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Coombabah

Hours of Business : 10-5 Mon, Wed, Friday

Rates : 120 / her 

Age : 42

Size/shape : Voluptuous size 14, DD - E real boobs

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian

Services Provided : Nude massage with Hand Relief

Value for money/recommend? : Yes / Yes for what you pay.

My experience/comments :

Unfortunately, I will have to keep this review relatively short as wingman has a headache . 

After six months of trying to get a hold of Sharon, the stars thankfully aligned and a public holiday booking was arranged, and the address including unit number were given out as well several days before. Thankfully, no last day cancellations were had and as I commenced knocking at her townhouse door, she quickly opened the door. What stood in front of me was a nice mature woman in her early 40's with a nice smile, fairly pretty face, and a voluptuous yet not fat figure, and if anything, for a girl that had a bit of fat on her, it wasn't wobbly by any stretch, just nice and firm. 

After pleasantries were exchanged, she led me to her room and soon after we were getting undressed in front of each other, which I found quite refreshing and no where near as intimidating strangely enough when compared to a girl leaving you in a room by yourself, not knowing if she's going to come back with a machete on your penis! 

Soon it was on the message table, for what was actually quite a good massage with a little bit of tickle of the tackle as well. Although Sharon had spent quite a fair bit of time on my back, she also did quite a bit on my front before moving to my Mars Bar (as she called it, a nice touch I think). Sharon has a nice technique on the relief side of things and even used hot stones on it, which was quite different but nice nonetheless. During the relief, Sharon was more than happy to have some sex talk through here and allowed for touching of her boobs and gentle touching of her mound, but not directly of her pussy. 

After completion, she cleaned me up in the shower and we had a nice chat to end our session. 

By the time i stepped in till the time i left, i had been there for just under an hour and a half. Sharon took her time and what you see is definitely what you get. Her townhouse has quite a bit of visitor parking close to it so parking wasn't a problem. Now, There was quite a bit of backlash about Sharon and how much she talks, yes she does talk, but i've found that quite a few punts with the aussie girls involve talking, she isn't stupid so I didn't mind it. But Each to their own taste at the end of the day. 

Value for money: Good massage, nice lady, very honest, good figure if you like big boobs and a bit of a stomach and nice enough finish. 

Would I return: Yes, but her hours are limited, so this may be a mission! Haha

Nice review Wingmanstinson. 

After so many posts in this thread, it's nice to hear a name to go with the attributes. Have updated the thread name accordingly.

Sharon on Coombabah aka 'ABSOLUTE QUALITY Personal Relaxation'. A find.

Thanks Fartichoke, 

Just to not confuse future punters, would it be worth changing the title to Sharon - Coombabah as the two suburbs are actually quite far away from each other. Cheers mate.

I thought Coombabah was a state of mind: 'Oh Lord, Coombabah'.

Obviously a great loss to the real estate industry.

A massive public apology is owed to GCME, I had another massage with Sharon on Saturday morning and my God, the glass really does come crashing down loudly when you realise how much this lady does actually talk, I think the first time I saw her, I was more curious than anything So i didn't actually realise the brutality of her tongue however, on Saturday, it was glaring at me in the face. Feeling the preliminary symptoms of a head cold, All i wanted to do was relax and take in the view of those cans, but alas, my initial boner was quickly quashed by how much her ramblings consisted of her life and debts caused by ex-bfs. For fuck sake was I disappointed, not only was I now becoming sicker with worser breathing but I had to listen to her disappointing fuck up of a life story. 

Now there are ladies that talk, and then there are ladies that talk about their more intricate personal lifes, let's get this straight, talking is fine to an extent, but for fuck sake, we pay you to massage, not to talk. 

End of rant.

Her cans are something to behold I must say, especially when you're pounding her  

So yes, in my visits I have now discovered that for some lucky few she offers a full service ending for an extra 50 which is pretty good, but yeah, nothing like trying to get hard whilst she talks about her ex-bf's

My experience/comments : 
I went and saw Sharon, my second ever paid experience in late Feb, 2017.

I felt quite comfortable with her communication and was greeted by a friendly person when I arrived.
Sharon was very easy going and told me about her day, what she has been up to, and even about what she wanted to do in the future. Although this small talk may not be ever ones 'cup of tea', there was a sense of grounded, down to earth person, which added to keeping me, the customer, quite comfortable.

The massage started and I felt that Sharon knew what to do. She ensured that, even on my stomach, my legs were parted enough for her to stroke the 'undercarriage', almost tease it, in between actually massaging me. The massage itself was quite good, she paid particular attention to sore spots and really got stuck into the muscles when necessary. As said above, in-between targeting areas, Sharon massaged between my legs until the actual massage part was over. Thats when Sharon came into her own.

Sharon started dropping lots of warm oil between my legs, all while I was face down and for about a minute or so, she got her fingers to get as close to my 'meat-stick' and massaged my balls so that when it was time to turn over, I was at 'full attention,'

When I turned over, Sharon put plenty of warm oil on my 'bell-end' as well as her hands, and she worked both hands with long slow strokes, caressing every inch. I'm not overly big, but the way Sharon moved both of her hands, one after the other, over my cock, it felt like I was huge! She then said that I could grab her breasts, which I must say were magnificent. As I grabbed and felt them, Sharon slowly increased her speed, she wasn't going absolute flat out however, she didn't need to. The way she worked 'it' felt great until I couldn't take it any longer and let go and cum.

I was offered a shower or a hot towel rub down, and took the towel option. Sharon made genuine small talk when providing the rub down.

I paid for the topless massage, not the nude service, however, that was fine. Sharon advertises herself as a Busty Attractive, Curvy Size 12, DD - E Cup and she is spot on with her description. I would recommend her.

Cheers,

Dognuts

My experience/comments : 


So I decided to book a session with Sharon again. It’s been a while and it’s always a bit of a catch 22.
On one hand you know she will give you a decent massage and iron out any knots, has same big titties to play with and her hot oil handjob is decent, but on the other hand, the dribble that she talks is irritating (ex boyfriends, ex fuck buddy, needing money as she’s been ripped off etc...)

Well, all of the above occurred, solid massage, plenty of tackle tickle, I asked her to focus a bit on the outside of my arse too which she did.
Her front body slide isn’t great but the cock between her tits is a good look.
Now, Sharron is in need of some extra cash and she is openly advertising extra’s from anal play with toys, titfuck’s and full service.
For return customers, that ‘special’ menu has always been available, just not openly advertised. Now it is.

The ending was halted early on my behalf as I added an extra $50, put the dom and slipped into that surprisingly tightish pussy and fucked away. I pulled out when ready, slipped the dom off and blew over her tits and stomach.

Sharron says she needs the money but to be honest, she has always wanted the cock, and now is just freely advertising it.

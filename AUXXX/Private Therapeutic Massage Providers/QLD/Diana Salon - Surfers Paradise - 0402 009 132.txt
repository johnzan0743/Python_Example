Value for money/recommend? : Once off only perhaps money might talk if she gets desperate but nah

My experience/comments:

Diana advertises on Locanto or rather did,
She is Drop Dead Gorgeous with curves in all the right places.
However she is married tells you that and does not offer anything outside of a massage. She has cleavage to cream your pants with and curves to kill your dreams. 
She has a great body and knows how to use it.
Practical and purposeful She has a good knowledge of structures and physiology.

She knows exactly what she is doing and she is teasing that is about all she knows.
I think she enjoys turning guys on and getting a peek at blue balls 

She does a decent oil massage.

I paid $100 for the hour massage. Well worth it to have this beauty work on my glutes.
She does 30 mins for $80 so I elect3d for the value punt of the hour.

Uncertain why she has not been reviewed save for too many girls not enough time or.cash.

There are plenty of gorgeous babes in the Surf Coast and Diana is another one.

Her pics are on the money. She knows she is playing with fire but the rewards are she earns enough to keep her in souvenirs 

She goes close to the tackle but knows how to avoid getting herself into trouble.

If you enjoy being massaged by a scantily clad lassie who is not going to make your end of the evening a happier one then suggest you give her a miss.

She is an experience but have little doubt she used to pull cock before meeting her match. Rich enough to keep her not rich enough to keep her meeting the next mr right.

Worth a look as long as you have another lined up to purge the pouch.

Enjoy. But doubt you will be relieved but you never know...

Googled the number and it shows up her model mayhem page https://www.modelmayhem.com/diamond2b
She has herself listed as only a C cup

She is also on one of those pay to view apps so i would assume that she shows more on there. Nobody would pay to just see her in a bikini which she already puts on social media. Not as good from behind as the front. I think she is russian/eastern european but learnt maldivian massage.

I would guess that she is from Moldova (the small, former Soviet country between north-eastern Romania and south-western Ukraine) not the Maldives.

So she is Moldovan not Maldivian.

The perils of autocorrect...well if you subscribe to the infallibility of the software.... auto wrong it should be called.

I just went with the flow. iPads what would they know!

Yes I am a good judge of tits but methinks they may have sung in the key of "C" sometime before they met the pocket enhancement technique.... for certain they are bolt ons but likely were good sized to start....

She could be both. She was in the Maldives to learn maldivian massage from social media. 

When googling maldivian massage, apparently the government previously tried to shut down all massage shops but it is allowed now. Makes you wonder exactly what maldivian massage is. 
The four seasons hotel also offers Tantric massage. Very surprising for a 5 star brand name hotel

After doing a little research and using a little logic I think the correct assumption would be Maldivian not Moldovian.

She describes her massage as being the former not the latter. Also tropical climes are more attuned to this bods being as opposed to the colder climes.

Truth is something that likely escapes this individual. I am sure that she would get buck naked and screw your brains out if you offered enough incentive($).

Cashola plays a big part in some who serve to tempt us. Personally she is a good tease but requires some more exploration to fathom the depths of her shallow gene pool.

Money is clearly a motivator here. However her shop is setup to ply various trades.
Clearly she has E cups in her pics on the modelling site. Same as if she was 27 I would eat my hat.


Note in the pics  Wach she has Tatts and tits but the blurb says not Tatts and C cups. My oh my!

Clearly the truth from this lady is a foreign affair. Like some legs never the Twain shall meet.

Perhaps someone who enjoys a good tease might review her and then we can compare.

Above is the link to the Facebook page for this lady.

She has an abn under her real name in NSW Collaroy. Nthn Beaches. 

She is late 30's to mid 40's. Enhanced parts and possibly married to an Aussie but you wouldn't want to believe things she says without a good degree of scepticism

She doesnt appear to wear a ring so she may not be married but she definitely has a partner. She does refer to him as her husband though. He looks eastern euro and would guess Russian as well.

I have actually been to Moldova, which is a rarity.  And I can confirm that there are some absolutely babes in that part of the world, but they don't stay there long.

The capital, Chisinau, has some of the usual Soviet-style concrete monstrosities of buildings but also some beautiful pre-Soviet churches, such as All Saints Church with its pale blue and white walls and golden onion-shaped domes.  Also the Russian Orthodox Cathedral, whilst being plain from the outside, is beautifully ornate on the inside.

Some figures from The World Bank about the number of tourists visiting different countries showed that Moldova is the least visited country in Europe.

A couple of years back Moldova received a total of 9,000 tourists in a whole year.  As France receives 85million tourists each year, that means more tourists visit France every single hour that Moldova receives in a whole year.

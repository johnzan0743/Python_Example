My experience/comments : I had tried a couple of times to book with this young lady, but our schedules would not allow.  Finally got to make a booking, communications (by text) was easy & good directions given.
Met at the door by a pleasantly attractive girl in just a bra & short shorts. I love short shorts.  She took me upstairs to her very professional massage setup, handed over the funds we were off. Massage started brilliantly with a bit of good firm foot & calf massage, very relaxing....... unfortunately from here on it all went downhill.
Massage was very half hearted.  On the flip, whilst HJ was included she stayed well out of reach, absolutely everything was an expensive extra. $60 to loose the bra, another $60 for the bottom half. Oh, you want to touch, another $50 etc. If you want her naked, be allowed to touch & DATY it would be at least an extra $200 - def not worth it.

TLDR -  Cute girl, great looking tits (in bra) very mercenary with overly expensive basic extras.

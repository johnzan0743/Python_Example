My experience/comments : 

Been keen to see Kat for a while and made the text and got in to see her the other day. Easy to find, lovely big house and good location. Busy street but sufficiently busy to be discrete.

The shower is small but good and the towels are soft but not luxury.

The massage I have to say is top notch. Apparently she studies something to do with massage and it shows. 

Not much to say other than she was good and I came. No touching and no kissing, just a straight massage with hand relief.

Would I go back? Not intentionally. But if I got stood up by someone else and she was available, yes. Would I recommend others go there? Yes.

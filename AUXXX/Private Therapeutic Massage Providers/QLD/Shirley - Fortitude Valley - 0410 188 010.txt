My experience/comments : Getting back into things after a rest from punting for a while. Had some spare time late afternoon so I had look through the courier mail (CM) to see what is available. Text to the number and time arranged.
Arrived at the location but the ML wasn't there yet. Just a studio appt. I think she also work in a shop in Brunswick street. Arrives 5 mins later to enter a completely empty studio appt! Just an old foam mattress and towel on top. (I should have walked at that point)
Anyway, undress (didn't want to chance the bathroom) on the mattress for the massage. The massage was not only very unremarkable, I thought she was playing a keyboard up my back really, but too quick. 
Within 15 mins of getting undress, "rollover please" occurs and straight into the HJ. I asked her to slow down and I think she did for 2 pumps and back to full speed again. Shot a load, wiped up and dressed within 20 mins. 
Cheap money but I won't be back. Poor Service, Rushed and dirty apartment aren't winners for me. 

That is why they call it punting I suppose.....

Did she leave the unit unlocked for you to enter? Weird, when I saw Candy - Fortitude Valley - 0415 976 953 a week ago she had the same no-lock deal which is crazy when you consider that it's in the Valley. She said she'd been doing it for 6 months and was shocked when someone did break in and messed up the unit the night previous. From your description, most likely not the same ml but working in the same building which seems to be a go-to place for MLs.

 My experience/comments : look I know it's called punting for a reason but fuck me advertising as  a 19 year old in uni  and getting easily a 40 year old average looking warn out hag is something else is something else

turn up at 7 as agreed immediately disappointed with what I'm presented  with, no personality and quite possibly the worst massage I've ever had.

seriously tried to shoot my load within as quickly as I could but still took 10 minutes to get one away, just avoid.

Ive had a handful of those when on the GC for holiday or work over the years, I refuse to stay. just walk in future mate.

It is false advertising to the extreme, wouldn't call it a genuine punt through no fault of your own.

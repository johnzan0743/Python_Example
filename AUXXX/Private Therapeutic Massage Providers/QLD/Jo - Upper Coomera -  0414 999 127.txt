Services Provided : Massage in Lingerie and dress with Relief

Value for money/recommend? : Yes / Probably Yes

My experience/comments : Apologies from the get go for what may be classed as the brevity of this review. 

Missing my regular masseuse I have been desperate to find something different in the last few weeks as it would seem that most of the girls on the coast I've 1) Already seen and 2) aren't worth a revisit. I noticed a new number in the paper (or the online classifieds which replicates the GCB) and without hesitation I texted back to receive a prompt reply from Jo stating her service etc. However, She informed that with School holidays etc she could only do wed-friday 9-3pm which meant me having to decline an appointment given my normal hours of work. 

As luck, or poor fortune would have it I turned out quite ill on the friday and having informed her of my illness, she confirmed she was immune to such and allowed me to come for a half hour booking. Having seen the doctor and waiting around for my script it was off to helensvale and with time to spare, I even treated myself to a Lamington and some fresh H20 which went down well given the coast hot weather. 

Having arrived at Jo's house, I must say it was a very pleasant feeling to see the lady behind the door was not 10+ years more than she said she was, this can get especially tricky when the 40's bracket is talked about as 40's is often a euphemism for 50s+ . I even told her such, to which she admitted that she was in fact 45 But I wasn't turning away. Jo had short curly black hair and was extremely well toned and had guns bigger than mine (I'm fat and don't work out, go figure) and was dressed in a sea thru dress revealing her bra and panties. Jo asked me what kind of massage I was after and I asked for a light / soft massage which she did give to a reasonably good standard 

After a solid 20 minutes on my stomach I was then on my back and after some brief massage of my legs and stomach It was onto the Mars Rover. Now Having seen a fair few ladies her HJ is probably a bit too mediocre for my liking but she wasn't rushed but she did take the dress off and I did get to finger her very beautiful pussy which only had a thin landing strip but was absolutely smooth apart from it. The only problem is that after 40 or so minutes, she declared that I would have to finish myself off, but to her credit she still tickled the balls. Whilst this may have been slightly off-putting Jo apologised for not starting the tug earlier to which I informed her I don't usually cum quickly with most working ladies. Having finished myself off, Jo afforded me a warm towel and helped me clean me up. 

So Now I am almost indifferent to this lady as Whilst she was good with massage, the hj wasn't the greatest, but the price was very good for current pricing and by the time we had a chat it was almost an hour from the time I walked through the door, so she does represent value. But she did say she isn't comfortable with guests using showers as this is her own residence, So I'm glad that oil didn't touch the back. 

I think this is a case of my fellow gc comrades having to see her before they make up their mind on this one, for 60 bucks, if they dont like it too bad, but if they do, it will turn into an hour for 100 which is almost half price on some gc bitches. 

Happy Punting lads 

Wingman.

You are far too kind my friend, this punt has dwlled on my mind since I reviewed it, and given it is the cheapest for a delightful lady to rub your cook who can actually speak engrish, I think it is actually well worth it, but my work hours and hers just barely allign that's the problem!

 Jo - Now Working in Upper Coomera - New Number - 0414 999 127
				
Post Content: 
Mods - Can you please update the new thread to include the new phone and location, cheers 

Now this is more of an update than a review

I will save the need for a very long preamble, as in my case this turned out to be quite the preamble, as I didn't realise Jo was back working until she actually asked is this XXX, and she remembered me and all my features quite specifically. So it turns out she has a new phone number and is now working from a room she rents out from a friend which is situated on the non-dreamworld side of Upper Coomera.

The massage is still the same in my opinion, however she asked me how I like my hand relief, and I told her, and it was simply bliss, so the mediocre hand job is hopefully a thing of the past with Jo 

Now, just a heads up, if you take too much of this fine specimen's time, aka, go over the hour, she has a fairly blanket rule policy that she will not see you again, so with the half hour sessions, make sure you address any concerns of needing to have a longer tug if you're not a 5 minute screamer. Jo is meticulous with timing and be warned that she actually includes shower time within the designated session time, so you've been warned. 

I alluded to the fact that Jo provided an hour massage for repeat clients, accordingly I was treated to a nice 30 minute tug after the half hour of massage, so that was a nice touch. 

Final thing, is one thing I found off putting is the use of Baby Oil which not only smells (although being J and J) but gives off the exact same feeling as the Happy Dragon asian massage chain run by Mandy. So if you've got a spare set of shaggy clothes, maybe best to don them if you plan on seeing Jo. 

Same pricing applies as above. 

WMS. 

Her Locanto Ad: 

I am offering a half hour totally sensual massage and hand relief $60. Or if you prefer I can do a 15 mins hand relief only for $40. I do not do oral or provide full service.

I am 42, size 8, fit and well toned, friendly and easy going so you can feel comfortable . Please be assured of complete privacy. 

I can be available most days including weekends between 10am-5pm. Call or text, no private numbers. Please do not ask for a photo as I do not send out any. Thanks. 0414999127

Im fairly sure she works most weekdays and some saturdays and sunday pending the necessity for her to take her kid to and from work and other commitments. 

I believe she got back into work this week after the school holiday break however, she has family unexpectly visiting, I'll let you know if there are any further developments gc!

Saw Jo again. Like her a lot. She can converse, unlike many, esp the Asian girls who don't know what you're saying.
Very attentive and a a great RNT. I agree she is well priced and unhurried. Will be back

Griffy if you've seen her twice, for the benefit of others please write a full review. All I understand from your review is that she can talk. I'm not a moderator so it's probably not my place, but if you write a review including what you received, you help everyone and verify the experience of others. Cheers.

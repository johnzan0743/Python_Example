Not a review, but because I'm a nice person I stumbled accross another Caucasian Masseuse offering that little bit more (albeit covertly) so I thought I might as well pass this on to my fellow GC Punters. So I saw Nikki's ad on gumtree and feeling horny as per usual asked the same old sensual massage question. She replied with a text saying she does a similar massage in her therapeutic relaxation massage. After enquiring how exactly it is similar she then sent back a text saying that she doesn't exactly list all her services in her advertising and then confirmed that her "Therapeutic Relaxation" service is $150 for the hour and that she will be on the coast from Sunday Night (ie, Tonight).

My only setback is the unfortunate fact that she only offers outcalls as my research would indicate the fact she lives on the Sunshine Coast. Accordingly, I thought its only fair that I share her details for those that are wanting some change from their usual massage girls.

If you have seen her, or if you do see her, it would be good to get some intel, as the forum lacks intel about currently active masseuses on the coast.

Cheers,

WMS.

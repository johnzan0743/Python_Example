Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Premium Massage | Home Massage | Mobile Massage Gold Coast, Surfers Paradise, Broadbeach, Runaway Bay, also advertises on locanto every now and then but ad has been removed. For her privacy It's best you track down her phone number from the website. This is a gem, let's respect her

Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie

Services Provided : Massage + Hand relief

Value for money/recommend? : Hell Yes. 

My experience/comments : 

I initially saw the gorgeous Cameron advertising on Locanto. Having seen the advertisement, i was convinced that this was a legit massage in which the advertising then takes you back to Cameron's site called premium massage. Given that the locanto ad took me back to Cam's site I wasn't sure what to expect given how legit the site looked. However, its not called punting if you're not trying the waters. 

After a message was sent through Locanto, I was able to suss out that a topless handjob can be performed in a G for $50 extra, whilst this sounded okay, I just wasn't quite sure what I would be getting myself in to. Accordingly, I left this burning desire to see Cameron boil over for a few days, until I noticed her ad on locanto had disappeared. This left me even more confused, but I eventually decided to just call the phone number displayed on the site and see where the wind takes me. 

It was Cameron who answered the phone (Cameron runs the business) and upon answering questions about her rates and what she does, she confided in me that yes a handjob in a g-string could be done for $50 extra after her massage. She also told me what she looked like. It was then when she told me she had a set of DD's that were natural that the offer was too hard to resist. We then made a time and within an hour I had come through the door of her home to be greeted by a very good looking short but feminine blonde decked out in her gym gear. 

Cam asked me what kind of massage I was after and I explained I was after a softer relaxing massage. Cam left me to get changed and hop onto an extremely comfortable and professional massage table (this table would have to be physio approved, never seen anything of such good standard). Cam then set up her relaxation music (mainly sounds of the forest) and got to work. 

Cam has a very good technique which left shivers down my spine whilst leaving me totally at ease. Cam is not overly talkative however if engaged she doesn't mind having an engaging conversation. Me and Cameron found out we got along really well given that we have some fairly common life experiences in which Cameron told me about her studies at Uni which i can deeply sympathise with her about. That said, I would almost consider Cameron as a good friend now after seeing her quite a few times. 

On the turn over, it is clear that Cameron knows exactly what she is doing and the turn over for her is not just the all too infamous tug that many of us enjoy. It is her message but continued on the legs and upper body. At this point Cameron allows touching of her under her clothes, however take in mind she is fully clothed still. It is only till after the full hour, that Cameron will take off her shirt, bra and gym pants revealing a beautiful set of natural boobs and a very toned body and but complete with a lovely black thong. 

Cameron doesn't rush and the hand job is rather quite enjoyable with Cameron allowing touching of her beautiful body including a little bit of a feel through her thong (but no penetration, please note the difference!). It is clear that Cameron enjoys the ending of her massage too and this is no fake. Cameron takes care of you and provides a shower with lovely towels for your use.

I have seen Cameron a handful of times and I thoroughly enjoy each and every time. I would love to know how far some of her other therapists are willing to go with you but she has told me that she doesnt even know if any of them has done so yet but let's just say, if the option ever comes available to have either Renata or Amber stroke my dick I'd definitely jump at it. 

For the amazing massage and a fairly well done ending, I would say 150 is actually cheap considering this can actually buy up quite some time in which the massage can take well over an hour, so this is well worth it folks. 

Please note however that this is a professionally run business and Cameron tries to remain professional most of the time so this may well be a case of YMMV if you come across incorrectly with her. 

Enjoy Lads, 

Wingmanstinson!

Good work Wingman,

I actually had a double session booked with Cameron and another lass back a couple or so months ago but the studio in Biggera Waters they were using became unavailable due to the owners discovering what she was using it for. The only other option was the mobile session. So after receiving mixed messages I booked for a double mobile. I was fairly sure what was on the menu but sent her a text before giving my address out and she then ruled out any sensual action. After a few ping pong texts i cancelled the booking.
I am sure the booking probably would have included the h/j but upon reflection I made a decision based upon the changing attitude of the very delightful Cameron.

I am glad she came through for you Wingman. It is good to know my original decision to book her has now been vindicated. My thoughts are she may have some workers who are a bit wary and rightfully so as the Qld Police sex crimes fun squad seek to harm our chances of receiving our fair share of punts that end up making us happy indeed!

Keep up the good work.


Biggus.

Trying to add a contact number to the thread title, but http://www.PremiumMassage.Com.AU/ is not happy.

Maybe Cameron is gone, taking her webserver with her.

Thanks Biggus.

Thread title updated.

Callers would tell her if the need arose, that they'd saved her number on their phone.

Just to add to the above comments, from my times with Cameron she has confided with me that she doesn't do such a service with everyone, clearly she knows the triggers of the industry. Be gentle with her as she is one of the few truly good looking girls and she doesnt charge 5 arms and 7 legs for her service, so please be careful.

Thanks for the review Wingman - I can add from personal experience here that Cameron is a therapist first and foremost (and a very sexy one at that!) Extras are not the norm and most requests are/will be declined. Pushy idiots or those that need a sure thing need not apply but for those that are happy to take the slow road there potentially may be some rewards...

I will say I think what happened with me was she had just been given notice regarding using the Biggera Waters and was wary about how she was dealing with clients at the time. I had had the discussion regarding what would be on offer if I visited her. But as that arrangement could not stand under the circumstances she said she couldn't guarantee the girl she was going to accompany would agree to the sensual. After a number of texts back and forth we mutually agreed to cancel the appointment.

I thought I should clarify the above post as it may on the surface appear that I was indiscrete. That is certainly not the way I operate and far from my MO.

In Qld it is always a different way you need to approach the punt. Most guys coming from interstate don't appreciate that you need a different approach on the Queensland coast. 

What works in other urban centres simply won't wash on the Goldarn Coast! Kind of like the temp tans.

I did see Cameron subsequent to that post and can confirm Wingmans review is not only accurate but will stand the test of time as Cameron is standout quality!


That is all.

Biggus.

Just an update here for you folks: Cameron is no longer working from Mermaid Beach as she's moved to Brisbane. 

I am not sure if she is still working or not but her current number is disconnected. 

For all you punters that never got a chance to see her, I definitely hope this is not a case of the Early Bird Catching the Worm.

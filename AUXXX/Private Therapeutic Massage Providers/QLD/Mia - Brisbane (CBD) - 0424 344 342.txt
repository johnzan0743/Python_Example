Person's Name :   Mia

Date of Visit :   18 January 2012

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :   CM - 0424 344 342

Rates :   $80 for 30 mins

Age :   early 30s

Size/shape :   busty, solid, hourglass

Nationality or Ethnicity :   Caucasian

Services Provided :   Massage + tug

Value for money/recommend? :   not my bag

My experience/comments : 

Having confined myself to the Asian girls for about 4 years now, I thought I'd go back to see what an Aussie massage experience is like.

Mia is not unattractive. But not really attractive either. Bang on average, I would say.
Big fake tits on a reasonably solid figure. She would be nothing to brag about if she was on your arm at the red carpet. But nothing to be ashamed of either.

She said that she provides body slides in my phone call with her. But there was no body slide.

She provides a decent enough massage and flips you over for a decent enough tug.

It was all a bit boring, to tell you the truth. 
So, until the next Cauc punt in 4 years, I'm back to the Asian girls!

Rnt.........you should know by now man, "once you've had Asian, you won't go Caucasian". It's my theory in life anyway.

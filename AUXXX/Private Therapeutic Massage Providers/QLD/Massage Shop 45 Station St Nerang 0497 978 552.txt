My experience/comments : Been a while since i took the plunge into a Asian Massage place, but was in Nerang around 10:30 today waiting for a client, he called to let me know he was running about a hour late, so was near the old Westpac when I noticed this shop, went in & a friendly girl on reception showed me the prices & asked if i wanted to stay, sure whats $30, so she gave me a drink & asked me to disrobe, she had nice tits & great ass. Anyways onto the massage, very nice massage, for the $30 i was totally happy just for the massage as it was brilliant & so relaxing, not really showing any real sensual parts to the massage though brushing the balls & ass crack just a little but not sure if intentional, anyways on the turn over nice upper thighs as I said was happy to leave it at that, eyes closed she taps my hand & motions the old hand job ? Asked quietly how much she said $20, sure, so for about 5 min she really works my balls & cock into a horny state. She let me grab her ass n tits as well so added bonus. 

Not sure if every girl does this but I think they do here, but a couple of times ladies come into the premises when I was there asking for prices, so would seem its very legit as in they massage both sexes but obviously the guys get the hand shandies...

Overall: $50 for a solid & very good massage with a nice handjob, what can I say, brilliant to be honest will be back to sample another girl soon. A few shops in Nerang that are easy to get to another 1 down at 31 Stations St.

Rating: 10/10 simply value I dont know where you will beat it.

AS ALWAYS YMMV

My experience/comments: Saw the ad in the CM and thought I would give it a try after the great experience I had a few days ago with Pimpa in the valley.  Well....it was not great....I wouldn't even say it was good.

Coco's ad is:  "Sunnybank Asian 19 sensual full body relaxation 0432 079 570"  Of course I knew she would not be in her teens, but I half hoped she would be in her 20's.  Wrong!  She is at least 30, and then maybe a few years more.  On the plus side she does have a slim figure, and her boobs are still a bit perky.

On the down side the whole experience was routine and I felt like a guy in a queue at Woolworths deli with a number.  Her massage was way too hard and bony even after I asked her to soften it down.  She also seemed to waste a fair bit of time with feather light touches on the back and thighs.  Then when she asked me to roll over and started with the tug, she had virtually no technique.  She sat on my ankles and reached right up to my tackle which meant there was no touching possible.  After about 5 minutes she seemed perplexed as to why I had not come yet.  She tried again for a few more minutes then apologised (which I appreciated) and then got up and gave up (which I did not appreciate)  WTF?  She walked out of the room to answer her mobile and took a booking for the following morning.  I quickly went limp, got dressed, and left scratching my head as she said "See you next time"  WTF again!

Has anybody else been to see this lady?  Hopefully I struck her on a bad day and others have left with a smile on their faces.

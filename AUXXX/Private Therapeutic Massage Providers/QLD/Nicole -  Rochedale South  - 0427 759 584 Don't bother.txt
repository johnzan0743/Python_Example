My experience/comments : Was in the mood for a rub with benefits about a week ago. I had seen Nicoles add & thought I would take a punt. Making the booking was as easy as a phone call. Clear direction to the location & a time agreed to.  Arrived on time, knocked & was met at the door by Nicole. She showed me into room & I got the disinterested / going through the motions vibe. I did notice numerous diplomas / certificates on the wall so I figured I may at least get a decent massage. After the financials sorted on the table & requested firm massage.
To be honest I think a 95 yr old with 2 broken wrists could generate more pressure. Very ordinary massage.  Got to the flip & the top came off, I almost asked for her to put it back on. Saggy tits, round belly, dull saggy face, all in all not a good package. 
Eventually got the job done & was out of there with 15 min left on the clock. As much as I hate being short changed on time I was glad to go.
Would I ever go back, no chance. 
Seriously guys save  your hard earned & go elsewhere, you will almost certainly get better eye candy, better rub, better attitude & better finish.
3/10   at least she got her tits out, saggy as they are.

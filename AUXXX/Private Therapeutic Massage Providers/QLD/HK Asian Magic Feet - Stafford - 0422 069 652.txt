 HK Asian Magic Feet - Stafford - 0422 069 652

Visited early April after 9pm. Beautiful body, natural tits, shaven pussy. Age 23-27. Paid $70 for 30min massage incl HJ. Private residence, massage in clean and tidy bedroom. She used her feet on my back but I didn't see how. It felt good. HJ was decent. She allowed touching but didn't take off her undies. We didn't much talk until after the massage. She was very friendly. I'll probably return.

I saw her on the bus the other day. She was on the phone and didn't acknowledge that I got on. Next time I'll say "Hello to your lovely feet!" anyway how was your visit lokvo? Where's your report?

I've been on a major dry spell punt-wise lol. I'm planning on fixing that though. I'm mulling over a few places...out of ekibin magic hands and HK magic feet which in your opinion is more VFM and a better experience?

I thought I would relate a very shabby experience I had with this lady recently,who is clearly not one of Brisbane's finest practicioners of exotic relaxation.I found her in the Courier Mail (Thai New to Nundah.Claims to be 26 but sounds a lot older surprise,surprise),called her up around 12.15 and made an appointment for 1pm that day.I was given the street name and told to call when I was there and I would be given the house number.I turned up 5 minutes early and called her back.No answer.For the next 25 minutes I waited in her street calling her number.No answer,no return call,no text,nothing.Just before 1.30 I gave up and headed off but decided to call one more time and this time she answered.I asked what happened to my 1pm appointment and she apologised and said that the previous client "had to extend his time" and that she doesn't take her phone into a session so she couldn't be contacted.Great service,I thought and told her I wasn't too happy with her.She asked if I wanted to come back but I declined and then I stupidly asked if she was free at 3 to which she replied she was so I made another booking for 3pm.Still not trusting her I actually asked her if she would really see me if I came at 3 or would I get stitched up again and she replied that she would definitely be there and she even gave me the house number.Again I turned up 5 minutes early and called her to confirm the house number and she told me that she had finished work at 2.30 and gone into the city as she wasn't sure I would come back.All up this useless woman cost me more than 2 hours of wasted travel and waiting time and seemed to think nothing of it.To all the Brisbane punters if you are stupid enough,like me,to book an appointment with this woman don't be at all surprised if you cop the same shitful treatment from her as I did.

My experience/comments: Wanting to try someone different and being in the area I decided to take a punt on a Locanto add. Lisa answered the phone promptly and an appointment was made. Lisa welcomed me at the door wearing a tight revealing dress. After being shown to her massage room I was offered a drink and asked to get undressed. With the weather in Brisbane at the time I almost felt as though I was back in Thailand visiting a shop in a back soi somewhere and this didn't stop with Lisa's massage. Lisa performs a very traditional Thai massage witch doesn't make it very erotic but she it climbing all over you and just before the flip does a few nice body slides. After the flip she jumps strait into looking after the little fella with a very good technique and at the same time gets up and straddles you giving you an excellent view of a nice shaved pussy. Plenty of touching is allowed but nothing 'inside'. Lisa's massage might not be for everyone as for those who have had a proper Thai massage before, they don't hold back. Later that day I  felt like I had gone 10 rounds with Tyson but the next day I felt the best I had for months.

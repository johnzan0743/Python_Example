My experience/comments :

I was very surprised with this service as it is located within a shopping center. To start with I asked for a full hour massage and picked a cute chinese girls from the lineup of available massage girls. I got shown to the cubicle (surrounded only by curtains)... I was left alone to get ready for the massage, I quickly took off all my clothes and laid naked facedown on the bed.

The massage girl walked in and I heard a very short gasp, she covered my lower area with a towel, after about 45 minutes of a normal massage with no conversation she asked me to roll over. 
She looked at my c*ck and motioned with her hand a jerking motion, and quietly said $50.
I quickly agreed and got $50 out from underneath the bed from my wallet, she squirted some oil on my member and started tugging. I tried to touch her but she wouldn't let me.

I squirted over myself then she gave me a towel to clean up with and left.

The whole thing felt very quick, and I think because of the shop being in a shopping center she wasn't too keen to be caught. I think she only spoke very minimal english as she wasn't keen to engage in any conversation.

I enjoyed it, but a very simple service.

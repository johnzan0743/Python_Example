 Monique - Capri Island (Gold Coast) - 0422 840 643
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Monique

Establishment : Complex Townhouse situated on 103 Salerno Street (Rafles on Salerno)

Date of Visit : 24 October 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0422 840 643

Hours of Business : Whenever she feels like ripping you off!

Rates : 100 half hour + nude (30)

Age : Claims to be 23, probably 30

Size/shape : Claims to be a size 8, but 12+, not well toned, largish B cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Claims to be French but definitely not, Fairly sure she's greek but not the one you want to lay!

Services Provided : Fucking pathetic excuse of an RNT

Value for money/recommend? : My disposable rasers are value for money, she was not. AVOID

My experience/comments :

Excuse the tone, But I will keep this short and sweet cause I am pissed but everyone deserves the right to know that this lady is out there. 

So It's thursday night and after calling everyone to no avail, I really needed to exercise my frustration, So i was getting wanked one way or another. Unfortunately this is what led to my demise. 

I rang this pathetic excuse of a human being (liars in this industry don't deserve two minutes of my time), and figured oh well, she might be a bit exy, but I'm desperate...What greeted me at the door, was definitely not what she described and from this point forward I will keep this review to dot points.


Works from a friends townhouse, in what appears to be the animal enclosure, constant cricket sound for an hour.terrible excuse of a massage, one handed at times, you're not disabled, so use both hands please!no tickle of the tacklemassage was so terrible i got boredmusic was one song on repeatShe was wearing a wig which doesn't help her aesthetics one bitasked too many questionsassumed too many cultural inferences (including me having to argue with her that I 'being from Morocco' was not islamic, not that it matters but still quite rude)On the flip, she still did nothing for me to the point where i never fully got hard (now, that is quite hard to do, im 24 with all the blood pumping freely in my veins yet nothing, absolutely nothing)I didn't know this was possible but the tug was worse than the massageShe was not french, but kept lying about it. Just cause you know a few words here and there, doesn't mean you're french, especially when you try and say that Lyon is in the South of France and it has beaches. Yes the south of france has beaches, but no beaches in the central part of it!

I dunno why we men don't just learn, but If you have some regulars that you can rely on, see them instead, don't be embarrassed to follow up so soon, cause the disappointment of a fucking shit punt will outweigh the embarrassment of seeing your regular girl just two days since your last session. I for one am very sorry that Cameron of Mermaid Beach was not the beneficiary of my hard earned Money. 

Forgive me brethren for I have sinned, and I appreciate that the standard is no where near my usual standard of review, but I am too pissed off to waste my time in being creative and writing a story, but instead, I thought that you should all know that this girl should be avoided like the plague.

I did make enquiries to this lady the other day, but my radar went off almost straight away. 

I do often wonder with so many decent girls out there why we always want to try new waters, I know for 1 there have been so many good value punts these past few months that I could just stick to them & rotate but I always want to try new girls, its a punters life trying unchartered waters me thinks.

She's advertising in the Canberra Times today ('a French model 25yo, blonde, exotic massage' same no.), looked up your invaluable review, wingman, and will give her a wide berth.  Thanks!

Yay, so glad I've saved someone some well earned coin. 

You'd be better off asking your local MP for a blowie than having an RNT with this excuse of a service provider!

Thanks for the review and heads up wingmanstinson, sorry to hear about your experience. 

She seems to display all the traits that many punters will find a turnoff automatically. 

Can't stand liars and these types especially. Its better for them to just shut up instead of expressing too many opinions from a point of view of a fake (the wig just tops it off...literally!). These people are just garbage. 

All the best for future punts!

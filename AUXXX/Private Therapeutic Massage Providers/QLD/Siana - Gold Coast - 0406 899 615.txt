 Siana - Gold Coast - 0406 899 615

Hi there just wondering if anyone from the great state of qld has any intel on a pml that advertises in the GC Bulletin. She calls herself siana and works on the number 0406 899 615. I had to change my time with her slightly, which then she responded by saying that she has already gone home as she got confused with my appt time adjustment ( by 15 mins mind you ) and thought i was no longer arriving......Just wondering if its worth it???? if anyone knows 
Cheers GC

gcme, 

I saw this lass sometime last week but unfortunately I havent really had time to write a detailed review and it was honestly nothing to write home about. The lady is at least 40 as you can tell by her skin especially on her face and she is a size 12 or maybe even a 14. She has a pretty good rack but I'm not sure if they're real or fake but if they are real it would be explained by the stomach she has. 

Now, as for massage, I wouldn't recommend going to her if you actually need a real massage, its a pretty pathetic excuse for a massage IMHO however, she does try and do some body slides but they don't feel that great especially when you can smell the cigarettes on her breath . 

She had me turn around within half an hour, much to my disappointment, but before I came, i made sure she'd let me come another time if time was available, so credit to her at allowing me a second helping so to speak. The hand job is not bad and I didnt feel the need to give her a helping hand.

One of the con's that I personally know you won't like is the talking aspect though, she doesn't stop talking and she really is too inquisitive for her own good, so tread carefully. Now I must point out that extras are a pretty solid no with her as she explained she was pretty devoted to her partner (anyone see the irony). 

I guess you can always try this one out for yourself, as YMMV but I left a little dissappointed with the talking and smoker breath aspect of it, but who knows, we all have our own likes and dislikes. 

Good luck my friend 

Wingman!

I'm saving everyone else but my bank account GC! But yeah, it looks like there are too many duds it's not funny. I recently saw a bird in Miami good message, good tug but fecking expensive as shite and that was without taking extras into account, will report back when I find the cajones to justify how I spent 300 bucks in an hour for a tug! But until then, Happy Punting

Good intel, thanks wingman. She advertising in Toowoomba a bit recently and was nearly going to giver a call. Seems to have a new number (0477 504 288). I know this because she screwed up one of her ads and had both phone numbers listed. She is listed for full service as well here.

It may be her friend that does the advertising in Toowoomba who I knew she worked with, but she was as straight as could be with me about full service, so not sure mate.

I saw an old Cracker ad for her with a guy down in the Tweed. The ad is removed, but that might be the bf you mentioned?? Full service was on offer from memory, resounding irony haha... maybe. Any idea about the friend? Thanks mate.

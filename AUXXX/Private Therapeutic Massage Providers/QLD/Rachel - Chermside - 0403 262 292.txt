My experience/comments : Another one from the CM.Claimed in the ad to be 20 but I reckon closer to 30.Answered the door in a very short tennis type skirt and a very well filled bikini top.Was shown to a room with a double bed,a wardrobe opposite with a large mirror and a bedside table with multiple mobile phones and condoms on top of it.The next room down the hall was set up the same but she was the only person there that day.Maybe others work there on different days.
Nothing pisses me off more than what happened about a minute into the massage.One of her multiple phones rang and it was some punter who wanted to turn up pretty shortly so she told him to come in 20 minutes.This was 2 minutes after just taking $70 from me for a 30 minute booking!It was pretty obvious that she was a get them in,get them empty and get them out type of operator so I did my best to get my full 30 minutes.As expected the massage didn't last long and I was turned over and she started to try to rip my dick off presumably to get me finished quickly.I was having none of this so I took matters into my own hands to slow the pace and then tried to see how far I could get with my left hand.She was quite happy for me to play with her pussy and good sized tits and then I decided to try the ass to buy some more time.She wasn't totally into it but I did get a digit a fair way up there and had a bit of a play around.
After running out of tricks I finished up with her giving me a good nipple chew,which I am quite partial to.I don't think I got my full 30 minutes but I managed to get reasonably close after taking charge of proceedings and slowing the pace.
She did tell the bloke on the phone that full service was on offer for $100,which explains the condoms,but I didn't go there.One thing that had me stumped was her nationality.I originally thought she was Chinese like all the rest of them but the more I looked the more she looked sort of Islander/Maori-ish and she was way taller than the typical Asian girl.I suppose I could have asked but I wasn't that concerned.
I had a reasonable time but I wouldn't go back.

 Emily, young Aussie girl - Cairns (tour) - 0455 731 114
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Emily

Establishment : Hotel room. Acacia Court on Lake Street (back entrance)

 Date of Visit : 29 November

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0455731114. http://cairns.locanto.com.au/ID_3565...oday-only.html 
Pics in the ad are 100% real. She looks much better in person than the pics

Hours of Business : She said one day only (ie 29 Nov)

 Rates : $120 for 30mins massage including hand job

 Age : claims 18. Definitely young and under 25. 

 Size/shape : size 8. around 1.65m, leggy, very cute ass, slim with nice figure. Pretty face and light hair.

 Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian. Said she's from the Gold Coast and just up here to do this

 Services Provided : Massage and hand job

 Value for money/recommend? : Perhaps. Not cheap $$ but a genuine young and attractive Aussie girl. But she keeps her bra and G string on and didn't allow touching. 

 My experience/comments : Saw an enticing ad on Locanto and curiosity got the better of me. The way it read I figured it might be for real (for a change).

 Sent off a text and got a quick reply. Sorted the time. Arrived and sent another text. She told me the room number. Back entrance to hotel, plenty of parking and nice and discreet. The room she was in was on ground level so very easy to find.

Knocked and this young attractive girl answered wearing a nice short dress. During the massage she mentioned that she was up from the Gold Coast and new to this (after some 'easy' cash I guess). Said she was flying back tomorrow. Paid the money and she took off the dress but left on her bra and g string. Nice sexy body, delicious legs and very good ass. Nice eye candy.

Crap massage but reasonable hand job, nothing special though. If you like young and attractive Aussie girls then Emily is worth trying. But unfortunately she's available today only. So you'll need to get in quick!

I saw that ad. 

I also saw two similar one with same photos/price a week or so before. They both had different numbers though and one ad even noted that the new number was because the other phone wasn't working. The other ads were under a different name Jess. 

I copy and pasted the important bits of the ads into my notebook. As she was on my radar. I didn't end up seeing her though. But if she comes back up, I might have to. 

Also this could be in the regional qld section not that I mind just saying.

I am pretty sure have run across the add or similar in Bundy a month or so ago, spotted when up in the area but alas just the times available never met up with my schedule so kept as think she is a travelling salesgirl.

You didn't miss anything. She's changed, lost quite a bit of weight. Now shinny rather than slim and shapely. Not the same personality either. Very mechanical HJ. My gut feel is she's on drugs or something. Sad.

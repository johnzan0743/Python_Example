My experience/comments :

Found Marin in Locanto. Ad was titled  "Private house in Broadbeach". Ad is now gone and googling further shows multiple ads with same details and mobile. None are current right now.
So arrived to a reasonably attractive girl. 28 looks right. A cup and reasonable ass.
Paid 100 for 1hr. Massage started. Very average massage with some tackle bumps and scratches from finger nails. Yuk.
35mins and rolled. Asked if I want extras. 100 for cbj, nude and 69. 150 for fs. After paying 100 I was a bit annoyed but went with the 100. Ass is great, tits are nonexistent and attitude is mechanical.
To start she cleaned me up with a Warm towel and then talcum powder before she started the extras!!! Different. 

On with a Dom and she straddled my face. Room was way too dark so asked for lights. She turned them on. Great looking pussy!! Buried into daty. At least pussy was clean and sweet. Cbj very average and shallow so off with the dom and she finished me with hand/oil

Cold insensitive and expensive.
If it wasn't for the great ass and sweet daty I'd be really annoyed.
45 mins and done!!! As soon as I finished so was she. Couldn't be bothered arguing. 

Definitely a no-go. Expensive and much better out there. Although I do suffer bad luck on the GC. Girls are mostly cold and disinterested from my little bit of experience.

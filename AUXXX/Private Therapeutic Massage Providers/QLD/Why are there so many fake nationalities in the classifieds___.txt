 Why are there so many fake nationalities in the classifieds???

I have had too many experiences of Chinese posing as Koreans (they do not speak a word of Korean)/Thai posing as Japanese (same as above) etc

Can't they just make everything easier and just put the right nationality in?

There is a hierarchy of Asians. Japanese at the top Koreans and Thai mid way and Chinese and Pilipino at the bottom. You will notice they all lie to promote themselves up the order. You never see Japanese say they are Chinese or Thai.

Not so sure about this so called hierarchy.

Yes this is true - it really is dicussed only by the Asians themselves. From past asian girlfriends (and it will vary slightly who you talk to), I have picked up a pecking order along the lines of the following:

Japanese
Korean
perhaps Singapore/HK
Taiwanese
Thai
Malaysian
Indonesian
MLC
Filippino

Now this list is biased from the Asian peoples' perspectives, and subjective from our perspective. 

As MLC become more powerful and affluent as a stronger power in the region, we will see MLC climb up the ratings - unsure where Vietnamese (Cambod, Lao) or Burmese might sit. 

Please discuss

I don't think Chinese people regard themselves as 'lesser' than Koreans and Japanese. Rather, the opposite in fact. Most races, including us Australians in a certain fashion, consider ourselves unique and better than others. It is quite absurd and racist to think that even Asians themselves, consider some groups of peoples to be worse or inferior to others in such a systematical fashion.

Instead, it is probably all related to the goal of getting more clients. There are definitely more Chinese than Japanese or Koreans both living in Australia and within the working industry. It's easier to stand out.

No, it is a broader issue than you paint kumkok.

Asians are racist in a way. Look at Malaysia - where Malays have embedded rights in law over the national Chinese and Indians there - the Bhami (spelling?) Putra legislation. Also in southern asia in India, with their caste system  (and not even bringing in religious issues between Hindi and Islam).

In Australia, there is no rascism like this.

It is a bigger issue than how the WLs in Sydney set goals for more clients. This is a pecking order I have heard from Asians, they joke about it to some extent, and it is perhaps related to the affluence of the country, and why MLC will climb up the scale.

@Andy. Exactly who makes this list up. Is this asian people or working girls? Cos I'm asian and have never heard of that list. And I like to think that I'm 1st rate (like any person would)

And to open up a bigger can of worms, some asians might be racist towards one another (that's because of history and current wars going on. Like in Indonesia Vs Philippines in the south with Abu Sayyaf, an Al Qaeda affiliate) some aussies might be racist towards asians as well and vice versa. Its absurd to think that its actually a list and a pecking order. 

At the end of the day you, the punter, will fuck who ya gonna fuck. And seriously, there are fine Japs, Koreans, Viets, Filos, Chinese, Indian ladies and so forth. If you got "yellow fever" you'd go out of yo mind right now and I don't thick that you will be thinking about where she comes from, you'd be thinkin about getting yo swerve on!!!

Look at @Flyboy gallivanting all over asia and I'm sure he'd be the 1st to tell ya that asia is a gold mine of fine young ladies. Same as @JB1 all over the Philippines.    

Australia is one of few nations where you can get ahead with hard work and a fair go. It don't matter what nationality you are, SKILLS PAY THE BILLS. I'd fuck any woman who has "skills". As I'm sure most other punters would. To let race come into it is fucking wrong. 

If you wanna know why I think its absurd, look at porn. Asia Carrera, Roxy Jezel, Kobe Tai. They are fine ladies and they definently got skills. They are asian and well known in the industry. 

Seriously, don't let race come be an issue (whatever your nationality) about who you fuck?

Well Singapore is in Asia. WL's in Singapore fall in a few different categories (which are not made up by any other than Asians!). There's the cheap category $40/$80: Thai ladies. Then there's the middle category $80/$160: PRC, Indians. Then there's the high-end $150/$200 cat for Japanese and Korean ladies. Why two prices for each category? Because the customers are categorised too! If you're Chinese-Singaporean, you'll get the lower price. Otherwise you pay double. My numbers may be outdated but the pricing system is not.

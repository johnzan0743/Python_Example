I found this lady in the Health & Beauty section of the Courier Mail and she sounded Ok so I decided to give her a try.She operates from a house in Everton Park which is quite cluttered and appears to be her residence.
Upon arrival I was shown to a small bedroom and asked whether I wanted just a massage or a happy ending as well.I was quoted $100 for an hour with a happy ending which I thought was a bit steep so I asked about a 45 minute session and was told that would be $90 so I went with that option.
The massage itself was very good and the lady very pleasant.She was friendly & chatty but not to the point of being annoying and the time went quickly.
Upon turning over she oiled me up and commenced the tug with a very good technique.This,sadly,is where the session was ruined for me.Out of the blue she told me that I went over time I would have to pay back the $10 change she had given me earlier.Talk about a mood killer,she reminded me again several more times and when I eventually got over the line she said I had to pay her an extra $5 for going 2 minutes over time.
I have never seen anyone more concerned with getting that last dollar than this woman.I paid her the $5 but when I got back to the car and checked the time on my phone I had only just been there 45 minutes which included her leaving the room to get a wet towel.
The money grubbing totally spoiled what was an enjoyable session for me and I definitely won't be returning.
During the session she stayed clothed and would not allow touching so clearly there is better value out there.Also,there was no offer of a shower despite a lot of oil being used.Given the state of the rest of her house that may not have been such a bad thing.[/COLOR]

Toad was in Adelaide on business and at a loose end with some sore points.  A brief scan on Cracker revealed Wendy's ad which neatly links to more detail on her website.  She's a fair way out of the CBD but with wheels and a sat nav on hand, that was no problem.

The venue is her private home in a fairly ordinary street.  Door was answered promptly by Wendy's "secretary" who handled the money.  Some details were requested as sometimes happens with (semi) professional massage, but there was no compulsion to provide.  With the deal settled it was into the quite warm room which has a mat on the floor, and Toad was left to strip off.  Wendy returned shortly after wearing a lace black top with nothing underneath and a pair of very tight boy shorts.  

The session began with some breathing exercises and then a comprehensive run through the tantric chakras, with excellent relaxing massage included.  After maybe 50 minutes of this came the flip and more massage and chakra attention from the top.  At this stage the most erotic aspect had simply been the touch and a brief session where she focused on the sacrum.  Then things got interesting as Wendy sat between my splayed legs, with her legs over my hips, so that Toad's Tool was in easy reach and quite close to her nirvana.  Then began a gentle and persistent massage of Toads Tool and Testes, with the intensity ebbing and flowing as my passion rose and eased.  Finally it became too much and the massage pressure increased in line with increasing orgasmic pressure until Toad's Tool delivered a massive and explosive blast of cum that seemed to surprise her.  She didn't shy away from the task and made sure that the massage continued throughout the ejaculation and well after - so the sensation was extended and complete.

Closure was a little (and quite pleasant) head massage, followed by a hot damp washer wipe down.  

While there was no touching her (I didn't even consider asking) and definitely no sex, it was an excellent session that drained me far better than many RNT operations, at a reasonable price for a 90 minute service (and the full 90 minutes were delivered too!).

Thank you for your review Toad.

A find.

Thanks Fartichoke,

And the first time I have indulged in such a service, so a double win.

Wonder if her phone will go ballistic now

If you do a search of the internet for "tantric" it should resolve the question for you.

As does sensual, so what is your point. Go get a proper Tantric session and then you will know.

Well Jadaya,

I seem to be the only other member of this site who has actually reported on a visit to Wendy, and I was more than happy with the tantric option.  I can't possibly offer an opinion on her sensual offer - I didn't sample it.  So, it looks like you are going to have to take the sensual option and report your findings - all in the interests of shared experience of course .

But I do suggest it's reasonable to think that if she does well on one discipline, the other is likely to be OK too.

Looking forward to your report.

These are located in Sydney What Happens in Tantric Sessions - Tantra Goddess Directory - MassageTantra Goddess Directory, Sydney Tantra Eve - Sessions For Men but not sure about other states especially SA. 

From Wendy's site jadaya, I think her "tantric" is something else especially by the price structure. Maybe an opportunity for a local to sample and review so we know her "version".

My experience/comments : Tiffany, who also goes by the name of Sonya at 110 south road, is beautiful, youthful and quirky. 
She provided a good massage before the flip, and an amazing tug after. She really is beautiful and had me shooting off in no time. 

She is a good conversationalist, is quite cheeky and funny and apparently she's a mean cook too. 
She is probably the best around at the moment, as far as generic asian R&T / FS venues go. And the venue has many nice touches also,
like a propper thai massage joint.

She is professional, clean, beautiful and friendly. Everything you could want in a $60 rub. Did I mentien her incredible body, cheeky smile and capturing eyes?

Enjoy!

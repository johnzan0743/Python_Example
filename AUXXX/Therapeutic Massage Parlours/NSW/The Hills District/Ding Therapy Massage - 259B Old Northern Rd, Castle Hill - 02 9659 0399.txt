Found this place in the local paper and been a couple of times now but haven't had time to review so here it is. Its upstairs through a doorway next to Domino,s Pizza (I think) on Old Northern Road. It looks like there is about 5 rooms at this place. 2 at the front with doors and 3 I think out the back with curtains only. The 2 front rooms are the go as they are private and the walls go all the way to the ceiling. This place looks like a legit joint and Shu the owner does a very good remedial massage and really knows her stuff. She is properly trained and you can tell, just don't ask for it hard cause boy this woman is strong, you can also ask for a health fund receipt.
She has been on her own since she started but I went there on Saturday and she had a pretty little thing working, says she now has other girls every day but as yet I haven't tried. Shu usually does the massage in a little black dress and doesn't mind a bit of a feel on the turnover but honestly she is no looker but does a fantastic massage.
This lady really knows how to blow a cock and the HJ must rank up there with the best at Tiandi, Northshore Jenny, 6A Selena etc. Just the right amount of tackle tickle and pressure and speed and knows not to stop suddenly and go the get tissues as soon as you fire.
I would say the other younger girls will offer more extra's but who knows what the massage will be like. If you have a sore back and a stiff cock give this lady a try you will be relieved of both.
Anway another option for those starved Hills residents

cheers

Establishment : Ding Therapy Massage

Date of Visit : Late August

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Old Northern Rd, Castle Hill. It's next to the Dominos near Towers and a building away from the petrol station.

Hours of Business :  Was there around 8pm

Rates : $30/30minutes + $30 HJ

Age : Late 40s/early-mid 50s

Size/shape : A bit more than an average size

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, hj

Value for money/recommend? : ok

My experience/comments :
Wow this place is not discreet at all: it overlooks Old Northern Rd near Towers and is next to a very busy Dominos. It's located upstairs and the stairs are left of the Dominos. It's the first door on the right but I think there's a sign so you won't miss it. Inside there are 4 (? not sure) rooms with walls to the ceiling and full doors. I was dragged into a room where the air conditioner was turned on for heat, paid and stripped down. 

There was only one lady and she seemed to own the place. She told me that she has younger girls at earlier times and to come back later. She asked me if I wanted a soft, medium or hard massage and I chose medium. The massage was pretty good but not the best I've had. 20minutes later she asks if I want a hj for $30. I comply and she goes ahead. It was an okay hj as well with some ball play. During this time I could touch here all I wanted through her clothes but she would not strip or let me go under her shirt. She was wearing 2 tops, a bra and skivvy pants (for skiing if you guys know what those are), not the best getup for sexiness.

This is the only place operating in the Hills that I know of but it's definitely not the best. Hope St is the closest parlour that I think is great but it's quite a distance from Castle Hill. I will be trying the new place on Terminus St but I'm also googling a beauty salon for that address and am unable to find the classifieds ad. :S

Been there a number of times over last six months.    Had the older girl mentioned and also a number of younger ones.    On Fridays Melissa a uni student tall, slim, chinese, good english very pretty does good HJ and massage.    All the younger girls seem to charge $20 extra for HJ and $30 on top of that for strip.   Most allow pussy touch but I havent succeeded yet with the finger.

Best value massage and HJ in this area is Ping at Pink Ping Pennant Hills (but no naked).

Date of Visit:    Wednesday 4 April 2012.

Hours of Business: 7 days 10am till 7.00pm

Prices:$35 30 mins + $20 HJ + $30 strip + ? for BJ

Age:  30+

Size/shape: Size 10, B cup

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Massage + Nude HJ

Value for money/recommend?: Not really

Decided to pay another visit and to compare with Hills Family Massage down the road.    Massage was mediocre, definitely not professional but it felt OK.   Oil on back then turnover, the HJ sign for $20, and offered strip for another $30.   Tried to beat her down $10 without success.   Nice body, allowed pussy touch and wasn't keen on the idea of finger but finally allowed it to help me get off.    During HJ offered BJ for extra tip but I declined - didn't ask whther it would be CBJ or BBJ. Think she had a cold as there was the occasional sniff during the proceedings.   I also think she might have had the slightest touch of BO but I could be mistaken - possibly the room needed airing. 

No comparison with 20/3-9 terminus Street or Pink Ping at Pennant Hills. 

I won't be back.

Ladies name: Coco

Date of visit: 23/12/2012

Age: Younger than 30

Size:8

Tits:A cuppers

Pussy: little bit of hair but yummy

Cost:$35 for 30  $60 for 60

This place has changed as Shu the owner now has 3 shops and does not work at this one anymore, thats a shame as she does a very good massage. Anyway back to Coco, a lovely little minx dressed in a blue cocktail dress with curves albeit small in all the right places. I was sore in the legs and asked her to focus on this, which she did very nicely with a firm but relaxing leg massage. I wanted the feet attended to also but she doesn't do them. Anyway asked if I wanted the tackle attended to and I agreed for $20. She wanted to get the gear completely off but I baulked at the toll of $50 after the Christmas shopping. Coco started tugging and I started exploring and even though I didn't get her completely naked I SAMPLED ALL THE GOODS! mmmm Very nice and Coco was getting off as i was getting off from a very nice reverse HJ. I suggested that Coco may like to earn some extra money in the new year as she was giving me the "nice size cock just right fo me " bullshit so I upped the ante and asked if she would like to meet up and got a hearing so more to report on that, but that will all have to wait until she returns from China in February. Coco works Saturdays and Sundays

Enjoy in the New Year

Age: Early twenties

Size/shape: Typical chinese shape, A cup, glasses, full bush

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Massage + Nude HJ

Value for money/recommend?: OK

After an absence of 9 months thought I might try this place again and see if anything has changed. The premises are the same as previous reports.

Helen greeted me and took me to the room and relieved me of $35 for half hour. Decided to be a bit coy this time so when she returned to the room asked if I could remove jocks.   Yes.

Towel over my back to start then a very good massage of the neck, then she turned to the upper back. After some attention there she climbed onto the table and went up and down my back on her knees. Said she had learnt this when she used to massage at a shopping centre. Very good.  Then legs, then the usual questions, HJ 20, top off 35, nude 50. Got nude for 40 :-)

Nice body, mini breasts and full bush.   Allowed touch of the breasts but no way was she letting me anywhere near the fur :-( . 
Acceptable handjob.

Offered me drink afterwards. Helen works Fridays, uni other days.

Aceptable deal and RnT but I still prefer Hills Family Massage.

Value for money/recommend?: OK

Handed over $35 for half hour, she put a new paper mat on the table.    I lay down naked.   When she returned I said to leave the $15 change on my clothes. Good massage followed, with oil and towel clean up. Offered me nude for $50, tried her out for $40 but she wouldn't play for that amount.

She allowed me to undress her, removing her dress then a pretty black bra (front clasp) and panties. Massaged her back then turned her over, she liked the breast stroke and teasing her pussy, but when I went for the clit tickle she said she could not come here as no sex allowed! I said that isn't sex but she then got up, admitting her heart was racing. I'll try again for a big O from her next time.

Then it was my turn, nice cock tease then hand job, then wipe down with a hot towel and all was done. One of the best at this place.

As all three girls at Hills Family Massage were busy, half hour wait, I decided to give Ding Therapy another try.

Emma greeted me.   I always have reservations about the quality of the extras when they are so young.     Paid $35 for half hour and gave her $20 tip when she returned.   

Good firm massage of all non-vital parts and hot towel clean up.  Then pleasant tease then turn over.     Nude -- yes for another $30 – bargained down to $20.    Superb A cup natural breasts, would only let me touch the fuzz downstairs, clit stroke definitely not allowed.   Says she is not a virgin, but shy.     Good HJ, remarkable for a youngster, which produced the desired result.    Another hot towel to clean up.     Took up the full 30 minutes.

She is a TAFE student, grahic design, and only works on Thursdays.

Was reading the days reviews on the bus home and saw the Hills Family Massage post re Mandy and DATY , i thought i might try and get me some of that so headed over there on the way home, alas i watched 2 other punters head up the stairs and enter just before me, so did not even bother going up. Instead i recall a few review's of Dings where OK, so why not.

Upstairs and knocked to be greeted by a quite attractive young thing, maybe 5ft 3, very good english and a nice welcoming smile. Anyway stripped of and waited on the table for a few mins for Sasa to come back. She started the massage working out the tension in my back, really good massage actually, almost ping good, worked down to a quick once over of the legs then some bum feathering .. turn over .. you want HJ .. u need to ask :-). Anyway asked for nude , $50 pay now please .. so i don't look trustworthy ? Sasa strips off but leaves a G-String on .. but who cares, sensational tits and nipples, large dark nipples that extend 10mm easy. Gorgeous, and her eyes all of a sudden became very sexy. Was allowed to touch all over but preferred pussy through the undies, defintley no inside action, however go her to pull them down a bit so i could oggle, nice trimmed .. very nice. Her HJ was also very nice as she cupped the balls with one hand and HJ'ed away with the other, i sat up a few time and sucked on her nipples whilst looking into her eye's .. this is one sexy girl with the eye contact .. i would have spent way too much if anything else was on offer. I will return, loved it.

Finding myself in Castle Hill for no real reason today, decided to pop into this RnT to check it out. The place is not that flash, taken into a room by LUCY a 28Yo Accounting Student $65 per hour for the massage, after 30 minutes she said every body coming there has a Nude Massage & HJ and wanted and extra $50 or more, told her I will only pay an extra $40, she tried to negotiate more $ and went to seek guidance from the Boss so they must share the extra $ with the house for the extras, when she returned she took her clothes off to revel her body which had cheap implants to her slim frame and a hairy bush, not the best on her massages and Nude HJ was only just passable, upon leaving there were 3 young M.L's there and thought it was nothing special.

Date of Visit: Tuesday June 11 2013

Hours of Business: Monday to Sat – 10 am till 8.00 pm; Sun 10 am to 6 pm

Prices: $35 30 mins + $50 Nude HJ or $20 HJ 

Age: 25-ish

Size/shape: Petite, C cup, good english, vampish look.

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese 

Services: Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? OK

Sounded like some good reviews of this place lately, and having pretty much gotten tired of Ping's older ML's and paying too much for Mandy at Hills Family the other day I thought I'd give here a try.

Was met at the door by Bella. Quite attractive. Young with a "vampish" look to her - I could imagine her turning into a Goth very easily with some heavier make-up.
Paid my $35 and on to the table. 
She did a reasonable massage without being outstanding and somehow the conversation turned to sex and her fantasies. (I wonder how THAT happened!) 
Anyway, she told me that she liked watching porn, wanted to try a threesome with two guys, had never tried anal sex but would if she could try it in a DP situation 
and wasn't interested in lesbian sex, but would do a threesome with another girl to "keep boyfriend happy" if she had a boyfriend. She also said she loved to be fucked doggy style "hard... very fucking hard". Fair enough!

She really tried the hard sell on getting nude and B2B, but said that I couldn't do DATY and couldn't finger her, so I didn't think it was worth the extra $50 even though she did have a pretty good body.

On to the turn over and HJ and she went at it like she was trying to skin a dead rabbit. Ouch! 
Anyway, I got her to slow down and she was receptive to being taught what I liked and how she should do it to achieve the desired result. 
Once she worked this out, the HJ wasn't too bad and got me over the line.

She was nice enough, but being younger I got the impression that getting the $'s was far more important than providing an enjoying experience for the client, but there was a just a spark there I caught from time to time that it could be worth cultivating her as more might follow if you became a "loyal" client. I'd pay extra for a full service with her as I think she'd have the potential to go off, but not sure how this can be achieved.

I'm also sure I've seen her lurking at another parlour somewhere, though I can't place exactly where. Maybe someone here has seen Bella somewhere else? If it was a FS place I'd definitely line up for a turn!

Anyway, left feeling pretty satisfied and happy I'd only spent $55 on the day.

Popped in this morning, thinking it was good to have another option aside from Hills Family Massage.

Saw Lisa, Tall, late 20s chinese girl who was smoking hot in a tight short dress and knee high black socks.

Paid $35 for the half hour and thought we'd see how it goes.

Got a nice firm massage, only down side was a few phone calls she took as other girl in was busy (Emma, I discovered).

Then, just when I was thinking nothing was on offer, she kissed my neck and asked if I wanted a happy ending. Well duh. For $50 clothes off with a bodyslide. Bit pricey but that's what I went for.

Back body slide was great. Tackle play. Kissing my neck and back. Brilliant. Turned me over and alas, she just seemed focus on giving me the HJ and getting me out the door - which she successfully did!

Anyway, on my way out, spotted the previously mentioned Emma. Hmm, wouldn't mind some of that!

Amy was wearing a knitted dress with a V neck which showed a modest amount of cleavage.      Gave her a full frontal and wanted to check the merchandise but she was not keen on that idea and said “I do massage”.  Offered her a massage which she declined – don’t need that.     Found out during conversation today was her first day and I was the second customer.

Amy gave a very competent firm massage, has definitely been trained.  Followed by gentle stroking and tackle tickle.     Turned over and she made the universal sign, OK, how much you pay?   $20.  Oh you know the prices.   $40 for nude please.  OK.   Superb body and nice well shaped  natural B cuppers.     Said I could massage those.     Allowed my hand to wander downstairs and I found a damp moist area but didn’t pick up any reaction to stroking there.     Delivered a comptetent hand job.

Went the full 30 minutes, I said I would like to massage her beautiful body next time.    Not sure how that will go she is a bit reserved, on the other hand the clothes came off in a flash when $40 was mentioned. 

Amy works Tuesdays only.

Superb review.

You've provided a vivid description of the ML and what happened: the next best thing to being there.

Easy for someone to decide if their cash is well spent there.

Lastly, given the semi frosty reception you got, good job for pushing on in a relaxed & courteous manner.

Date of Visit: 23 June 2013

Hours of Business: Monday to Sat – 10 am till 8.00 pm; Sun 10 am to 6 pm (quoting others here!)

Prices: $40 for 30mins + negotiated $25 for HJ with feeling breasts with clothes on (would've been $50 for strip or $20 for plain HJ no touch at all)

Age: Early 30's

Size/shape: Normal build, B-cup but hard to tell as I didn't feel like paying for a strip as was waiting for Mandy at HFM. Attractive though in the dim lighting 

Nationality or Ethnicity: Korean

Services: Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? OK

Dings is right next to Dominos but easy to slip in/out except when they have the mascot holding out a sign on the main rd. Up the stairs, it looks semi dodgy the place and not as clean/well presented as HFM. Greeted by Ruby who asks how long, and explains pricing upfront of everything (including extras). I prefer this now as it means don't need to interrupt massage later on with bargaining.

Ruby is first Korean lady seen at these joints. She did a decent massage. Didn't clock watch but finished pretty much on time. English so so (for this type of place) but she tried to be talkative.

She works every 2nd Sunday. Decent, but probably wouldnt go back as it is close to main road, opposite busy cafe, etc. On plus side, it's next to a carwash if you wanted to wash car whilst you get massage?

Age : looked Early 20s! quite attractive with a very nice figure not tall but not short either.

Size/shape : C cup, slim in push up bra

Services Provided : HE (Hand Job - topless and panties) Extra 50

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

 This was my first ever punt - walked in shown to room by Cherry and asked how long - took the hour as I needed a massage. Dressed in a nice short dress. She did ask about massage pressure which I asked for medium to hard. Massage itself was quite good - had several legit ones before and she was on par with those. After 45 mins whispered into my ear about extras - English was not great but she asked about body to body - with hand signals and broken English though I was getting a body to body but in effect it was a HJ down to panties. Asked if I could touch and she motioned at her nice titties which were quite firm but appeared natural - but I am no expert. HJ was a little too quick for me and with the oil (first time for that) was a little strange. Finished off and was relatively satisfied with the experience. Overall, the place doesn't look much from the outside and rooms inside are ok although a touch too hot with the heater going - she did turn it off. Massage was 7/10, HE probably a 6/10, Cherry herself 7/10. Was going to go back and did a few weeks later. Would recommend seemed friendly and easy to deal with.

 Value for money/recommend? : Yes

 My experience/comments :

 This was my second visit and while the first was good, this was even better. Yuki was very good in the massage, even asked about the area I wanted to concentrate on. The massage itself was an 8/10 firm and hit the right spots for me. Must have been 30 mins in the question of extras was asked, but this time I was given options $20 for plain HE, $50 HE in the nude and $80 for an additional 30 mins body to body slide. Chose the HE in the nude. Plain Jane lingerie but nice body and warm personality out weighed the initial visual. The second half of the massage was much better than my first experience, there was some light kissing on the lips, gentle kisses on the nipples, which I was also allowed to reciprocate to. The HJ was also smoother, gentler and she seemed more experienced and more sincere. Later in the massage as she continued - to work the old fella - my hands started to wander and while she kept her legs tight she did allow some fondling of her thighs and brushes of her lips. Which was all I needed to finish up. She towelled me down and I started to get dressed. She came back in and said the clock in the room was fast and we had another 15 mins - so we finished up with a head massage. Overall a great GFE with a very lovely lady who made me feel comfortable and looking forward to the next visit. 9/10 in my books. The one negative of he place is the reasonably busy frontage it has, not sure if there is a back entrance that is accessible to the public.

As i walked in i was greeted by the mamasan and there was a hot little number on the sofa, i though bingo this looks good ... then there was some discussion about the roster and who's turn it was .. bigus thinking i may have to make my feelings known , fortunately it was resolved an the hottie turned out to be May. 

May's massage was EXCELLENT, i had a few knots and she worked on those .. she is a tease though, she climbed on the table and was straddling my back making sure her panties rubbed against me on more than one occasion .. evetually turn over time cam and the standard $50 for nude + HJ .. .. before i walked in my plan for today was just the HJ .. no nude as really at $90 i get get FS from 533 or elsewhere .. but she was really attractive .. dribble, dribble ... anyway when she stripped of she had tiny tits, A-cup with small nipples and quite skinny with a fantastic slim bum .. touching downstairs was not allowed but i did get a stroke or 2 .. she was happy to straddle me 69 style while doing the HJ and that was a gorgeous site, if she has said another $100 for FS the brain would not have had time to enage .. lucky she didn't :-) HJ technique was above average but not stella.

Had a chat after, she is Korean on a working holiday .. thinks our winter is pretty warm ! ..  would see again in a heartbeat

May works Wed.

hours of business: Monday to sat – 10 am till 8.00 pm; sun 10 am to 6 pm (quoting others here!)

prices: $40 for 30mins + negotiated $25 for hj with feeling breasts with clothes on (would've been $50 for strip or $20 for plain hj no touch at all)

age: Early 30's

size/shape: Normal build, b-cup but hard to tell as i didn't feel like paying for a strip as was waiting for mandy at hfm. Attractive though in the dim lighting 

nationality or ethnicity: Korean

services: Massage + hj

value for money/recommend? Ok

dings is right next to dominos but easy to slip in/out except when they have the mascot holding out a sign on the main rd. Up the stairs, it looks semi dodgy the place and not as clean/well presented as hfm. Greeted by ruby who asks how long, and explains pricing upfront of everything (including extras). I prefer this now as it means don't need to interrupt massage later on with bargaining.

Ruby is first korean lady seen at these joints. She did a decent massage. Didn't clock watch but finished pretty much on time. English so so (for this type of place) but she tried to be talkative.

She works every 2nd sunday. Decent, but probably wouldnt go back as it is close to main road, opposite busy cafe, etc. On plus side, it's next to a carwash if you wanted to wash car whilst you get massage

Person's Name: Doris (With a wonky eye)

Establishment: Ding Therapy Massage

Contact Details/Address: Old Northern Road Castle Hill 96590399, upstairs above Dominos Pizza.

Date of Visit: Thursday Aug 8

Hours of Business: Monday to Sat  10 am till 8.00 pm; Sun 10 am to 6 pm

Prices: $40 30 mins + $20 HJ x 2

Age: 26-ish

Size/shape: Average body, not fat, not thin.

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Massage + Double HJ

Value for money/recommend? OK

This place is pretty public, so if you're after a discreet punt, be warned - many cars and people around out the front.
VERY HOT super-MILF mamasan in attendance - Korean? Looked it, anyway. Would LOVE to have a massage with her. Classy looking lady. Anyone know her name or if she's available?

Anyway, I was allocated Doris - it was her "first day" at this shop today.
Doris isn't a name that really oozes sexuality is it? And neither is the fact that she has a wonky eye - seriously, her eyes look in different directions which makes it hard to know where to focus when you're talking to her. Not her fault, but again, doesn't exactly exude a lot of sex appeal.

Massage not too bad. Her first day here. English was ok - she actually sounds more Indonesian in accent than Chinese.
Flip and on to the good stuff. Asked me if I wanted to her to strip, but the combination of the wonky eye and the name "Doris" put me off.
I asked if it was possible to have a "double handjob" and get another lady in to "help" if I tipped $20 to both. (Secretly hoping that mamasan would come in).
Doris goes outside, lots of Chinese jibberish and then walks back in with Janet - an older Chinese MILF, but pleasant enough.
Doris jerked the gherkin whilst Janet rubbed my balls and played with my nipples. Quite a nice experience actually. 
Blew and cleaned up. Tipped Doris and Janet $20 each and they were happy.
Doris is pretty sure she'll be working Thursdays only.
Now if only that hot MILFY mamasan was available I'd be back in a heartbeat!

Person's Name: I did not get the name properly but could be Shu as she was an older lady- late 30s , early 40's

 Establishment : Ding Massage Therapy

 Contact Details/Address: Old Northern Road Castle Hill (across from Dan Murphies where its a good place to park .96590399 

 Hours of Business: (if known or applicable) 7 days 10am till 7.00pm

 Prices:$55 for 45 mins + $20 HJ + $25 nude 

 Age:40 ish

 Size/shape: Size  10-12  When stripped , a slit podge but good for a MILF

 Nationality or Ethnicity:PRC

 Services:Therapudic massage + NUDE HJ

 Value for money/recommend?:Yes

Comment : I will keep this short and sweet as this place is well reviewed. Parked across the road at Dan Murphys, so all you need to do is go up the carpark stairs across the road and directly up the stairs to Dings.
Place was empty except for the lady masseuse. It was only lunchtime.
Told I wanted 45 stripped and asked for medium. 
First ,massage was excellent , was sore and she got all the right places.
At about the 30 minute mark came the negotiations' ( I should learn to do these first). HJ $20 , strip $30. OK lets go for it all . Hj was OK , nothing special. Bit of a pussy feel and boob grab and finish.
 Now here is the interesting part. I gave her $100 and I think she put the 45 change on the chair. When I got up and dressed the $45 was gone so I suspect she took that as payment. Sort of through me out a little. She had left the rmm and she said goodbye on the way out so I just assume the $45 was the extras.
As I said massage was good (about a 7 on my Zoe rating system where Zoe is the 10) , HJ average. But body was pretty good for a MILF. I would do her , but some say that's no recommendation.

My experience/comments : In order to support my local shopping precinct I venture over to this place to see what is on offer . Just one lady on duty at 10am. Friendly enough , tall , slim but wouldn't say attractive. SHe starts off with a very competant massage - good strength & covering all parts of my body . On my back and she does a little sliding with her tiny titties gently tickling all the right bits . quite nice .Good attitude . Her finish is really good with an enthusiastic approach to her therapy. worth the $ for the massage .

Nationality or Ethnicity: unknown - most probably chinese

Services: massage

Value for money/recommend?: Ok

Comment : 
Decided I would pop into this store and check it out for myself. When I arrived, there was only an older lady (milf-vibe) - wasn't really fussed and opted for the half hour. Chose to get a medium massage which was done quite well, really working on my shoulder and lower legs. Really enjoyed the massage. Slowly the touches started to become lighter and more feathery.

Fairly bold in her teasing, but I just wasn't into it. She told me to turn over, and again was giving light feathery touches across my body then offered a HJ. 

Ultimately declined her offer - she continued the soft rubbing of my chest for a little longer then abruptly left and said times up... a bit rude in my opinion, but I got the impression I had slighted her in some way. 

Anyway, got dressed and left, only to run into two smoking hot asian girls. Both had very sexy eyes. So definitely potential for further exploration.

Mike934 I suggest that you always try to ask and catch the name of the provider as different girls may provide differing service. A name allows members to discern between them.

Hours of Business : 10am till 9PM
Rates : $60 an hour ($65 Sundays)

Age : looked Early 20s! quite attractive with a very nice figure not tall but not short either.

Size/shape : C cup, slim in push up bra

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : HE (Hand Job - topless and panties) Extra 50

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

 This was my first ever punt - walked in shown to room by Cherry and asked how long - took the hour as I needed a massage. Dressed in a nice short dress. She did ask about massage pressure which I asked for medium to hard. Massage itself was quite good - had several legit ones before and she was on par with those. After 45 mins whispered into my ear about extras - English was not great but she asked about body to body - with hand signals and broken English though I was getting a body to body but in effect it was a HJ down to panties. Asked if I could touch and she motioned at her nice titties which were quite firm but appeared natural - but I am no expert. HJ was a little too quick for me and with the oil (first time for that) was a little strange. Finished off and was relatively satisfied with the experience. Overall, the place doesn't look much from the outside and rooms inside are ok although a touch too hot with the heater going - she did turn it off. Massage was 7/10, HE probably a 6/10, Cherry herself 7/10. Was going to go back and did a few weeks later. Would recommend seemed friendly and easy to deal with
"""



to updateNirvanas post I saw Cherry today (Friday 13/9).

Quite pretty, 19 yo.   Yep talks about body to body but she means stripped with panties on.     I succeeded in getting the panties off with a promise not to touch.   Massage was OK but not professional.     Breasts are very nice I would size them as B and she allows a fondle.    HJ was quite good.    Had a conversation about why I could not touch the pussy (I expect this for $50) and found out she is a virgin, she gave me a peep of the pink place when I pressed her and her claim is probably true.  "I'm only 19".   

Also noted the price for a half hour had gone up to $40.    I paid $40 + $50 for a strip.    Nice pretty young thing but I felt a bit ripped off with the $50 toll for what I got.

Cherry usually works Saturdays.  Today, Friday, was a one off to cover an absence.     She studies Accounting at Uni on other days.

Surely an inviting name for a 19 yo virgin? Perhaps she is ripe and there are prospects for a serious attempt at cherry-picking...

Amy was wearing a knitted dress with a V neck which showed a modest amount of cleavage.      Gave her a full frontal and wanted to check the merchandise but she was not keen on that idea and said “I do massage”.  Offered her a massage which she declined – don’t need that.     Found out during conversation today was her first day and I was the second customer.

Amy gave a very competent firm massage, has definitely been trained.  Followed by gentle stroking and tackle tickle.     Turned over and she made the universal sign, OK, how much you pay?   $20.  Oh you know the prices.   $40 for nude please.  OK.   Superb body and nice well shaped  natural B cuppers.     Said I could massage those.     Allowed my hand to wander downstairs and I found a damp moist area but didn’t pick up any reaction to stroking there.     Delivered a comptetent hand job.

Went the full 30 minutes, I said I would like to massage her beautiful body next time.    Not sure how that will go she is a bit reserved, on the other hand the clothes came off in a flash when $40 was mentioned. 

Amy works Tuesdays only

Had another session with Amy today (Tuesday 1 October).    $40 for half hour + $20 for HJ  + $30 for strip.     She has come out her shell a bit now and allowed  me to massage her.      She wanted me to start on the front, that's fine with me!     Gave her the full treatment up to and including clit tickle, bit hard to tell if she came but ho, hum.....it's great to massage a pretty young body.    (No finger inside allowed).     A good HJ and back massage followed.     Now says she is 30, probably about right.       Works Tuesdays only.

My experience/comments : 

Called in this afternoon and said they were free. Went for 1 hour. I was guided into the room by a Thai lady, mid-30s and asked to strip down. Asked what massage I would like, and I responded with medium. She gave a very competent oil massage - knew where the knots were and really helped. She massaged my legs, but covered the third leg (not a good sign I thought) and continued with a professional massage. She then flipped me over and covered me in a towel and just continued massage my legs, head and back...and FINISH! Didn't offer any extras...

Whilst I can say the massage itself was perfectly competent, there was not hint of eroticism at all. Walked out and there was another older chubbier Thai lady. Maybe staffing has changed or this place has become legit? Every other time they've given me at least a HJ (although with different girls). Strange one...

Called ahead and arrived at the same time as another punter - ushered into a room, he got a choice I didn't.

$55 /45 mins
Service : Thai Massage

Massage was professional and that's all that was on offer. 

They have just advertised in the local paper - New Management High Class Thai lady - appears to have gone Legit although how the mamasan was dressed did give lie to that.

They also have a new website.

Would be interested to see if anyone else has tried recently.

Apologies for quality of post - had it written on notepad but could not post into here. Maybe a problem between screen and keyboard - but that said, every second letter Is not appearing so getting lots of red spell check marks.

This post by Nirvana (last post) suggests they may have gone legit   ......and I think their business might suffer as there is a much more presentable Thai place  3/268 Old Northern Road (on the other side of Old Northern Road going towards Castle Towers). 

I (or someone else) should try "Chinese" massage at the "new" Ding sometime when not in urgent need of relief......

Definitely legit now - unfortunately.

I called in there yesterday afternoon, and seems they're all Thai now. 
Different mamasan to the previous one and only Thai girls working there.

When I enquired if "happy ending" was available, I was told "not part of Thai massage - we don't do here". 

As Bent said - if this is the case, across a road a far nicer environment for a legit massage.

As this place now advertises in the local rag as "Adult Services" rather than "Massage Therapy" and there have been no recent reviews, I thought I would TOFTT to see if anything has changed.

Greeted by mamasan Jenny, Thai, 40s, a small amount of cleavage showing.    Took 30 minute oil massage for $40, Jenny showed me to the room, asked me whether I wanted soft or hard and oil or no oil.     Then left.    I stripped and laid face down.

MiMi then arrived, Thai, 20s, T shirt and pants, just passable English.   Covered me with towel and then washed my feet with another warm towel.    She delivered a top massage of back, bum, then legs, including inside legs at my request, but no tackle tickle.    Removed oil with warm towel then gave me pressure point massage of neck, shoulders and scalp.      Then said "finished" and left with me still on my front.      

Excellent massage 9/10, but not even a hint towards availability of extras - she was gone before I could ask.     

Really good massage but no good if you are looking to clean out the pipes.

The issue may be they do not have the credentials required to advertise under "massage therapy".      There is still a sign painted on the door saying health fund receipt available, which requires credentials, but that may be a legacy from the previous ownership.

Ah well, that's punting........often a gamble!

Well had seen the Locanto ads and a rather brief write up in Bronze which suggests another change of direction. 

Rocked up close to opening time and was met at the door by the papasan quite friendly handed over the cash and he duly handed over same to the ML. Bit of a discussion between the two about which room and side of the building and she got her way.
Part 1 was quite ok and very little if any sensuality. But as time passed she manoeuvred to where my hands could touch her legs. Out for a hot towel and then the feathered tickle with tissues started and the request for additional services.
Agreed to nude for 50. The tight dress was keeping things tidy and her age was more visible when nude. Anyway, was encouraged to have a little suck on the nipples which I obliged. While the TT was it did take a while to finish as ability to have a play was a little curtailed.

Anyway, Ding's is back, known as Ding's doing what they used to do.

My experience/comments Had the day off to pick up the rims for the MK11 Jaguar and see the Financial Advisor (Go to cash its coming) Anyhow noticed the sandwich board out front in Hunter St and thought WTF why not! Up the stairs and walk in to what was once a legit Sports Injury Practice to be greeted by Sophie who is obviously next up. I notice two younger girls out back but go with Sophie. There are three rooms and three girls daily. Stump up for the hour and strip off and on to the slab. Sophie commences a competent massage with enough TT to keep things hard! On the flip it's a pineapple for kit off and a Hand Shandy so start with that and Sophie has strawberry nipples and shaved Quimby she works my Bell End and shakes her head No! for FS but Spanish gets the Green light, Swap spots on the slab and Slide the old
ferret between Sophie's Enhanced assets and release onto her Boobs and Neck. Clean up and Head and Chest massage and onto Korean BBQ for dinner.
Not sure if this place will survive lots of professional practices in the building and I was watched coming and going.

Hi Steed 
Do you recall a Men's interest magazine called Ribald?
It used to feature a comic strip called the Adventures of Lusty & Blowjob. Maybe I should do a comic strip called the Adventures of Bell End & Ferret LOL ðŸ˜‚ 
Loved your review of Sunny. Must see her soon.

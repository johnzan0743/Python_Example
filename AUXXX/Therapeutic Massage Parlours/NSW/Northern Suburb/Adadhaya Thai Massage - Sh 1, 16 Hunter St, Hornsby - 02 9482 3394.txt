Age: mid 20s

Size/shape: Both 5'5" with nice curves

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai

Services: Massage + tug

Value for money/recommend?: No

My experience/comments: 


This is a slightly edited summary of three visits to this place. Some of this has been posted elsewhere. The third visit is new material.

Visit 1:

Background:  On another forum, a member asked about the service at massage places in Hornsby (this place and one on the Pacific Highway). To my shame, I must admit I knew nothing of either (given that I have lived in this part of the world for 12 years or so). So I had a look over this place and it showed some of the characteristics of an R&T  place  ie open late and the price of $100 per hour. So I thought I would try it out.

The lady:
Shian Ming (that was how it sounded)
Height: 5'5" or so, size 8-10, nice curves. Probably Thai, but don't hold me to that.
She is dressed in black: black shorts, black tights and a black V neck top.

I arrived here and was looking at the sign in the window refreshing my memory of the prices when Shian Ming came out and asked if I wanted a massage. So I said yes and was lead inside. There was a computer printed sign saying closing time was 8:30 PM. Their printed brochure says later. The place is a converted shop. The door is to the right of the place (as you enter). In front as you walk in is the reception counter. To the left is a raised "platform". There are two massage areas here  each with a mattress in the floor and surrounding curtains (in purple). Further towards the back of the place are a couple of small rooms. Reception is a large older Asian lady in a yellow top.

I choose the 1 hour oil massage for $100. I am directed to the first of the small rooms, and it is small, barely 8' by 4'. There is a foam mattress on the floor and a couple of small fans to keep the air circulating. Shian Ming directs me to undress and lie on the mattress. I comply but leave my underpants on. The oil massage begins  legs and back  it is soothing rather than hard. Part way through she removes my underpants and massages my buttocks.

Turn over time and the oil massage continues. She massages my thighs and goes temptingly close to my privates. At times she rubs my thighs and as she progresses to my stomach, her wrists stroke either side of Little Evil.

However, I did not attempt to "ramp it up". There were hints that more may be available, but I did not pursue them. At the end of the session, Shian Ming brought out a dish of warmish water and washed me down. No shower in the place. I got dressed and before I left, they gave me a cup of tea. I sat on one of the chairs in front of the reception desk while I was drinking it and Shian Ming sat opposite. Her pose would have been much more interesting had she been wearing a skirt rather than shorts.

After I had finished the tea, I wandered off home, but cast a glance over my shoulder and saw Shian Ming collecting another punter from the seat outside the place in the mall. This was at about 9:15 when the nominal closing time was 8:30.

The Verdict:
A pleasant experience, but poor value.
For $110 at the Thai places in Lindfield or Artarmon, or Butterfly in Gordon gets you nakedness, a bodyslide, a tug & happy ending (and a shower as well!!). 

Visit 2:

As a sucker for punishment, I paid another visit to this place (18 April), purely for scientific research purposes of course. A random sample of one is not statistically valid!! This time I saw Lisa. Cute, but a little curvier. The service was the same, but this time there was the offer of a tug towards the end of the session (additional $30). I declined - I had other plans for a happy ending that day.

As I was having the cup of tea and a bit of a chat afterwards, Shian Ming appeared and seemed to remember me: "Long time no see" she said. I was apparently Lisa's third customer for the day (this at about 3:00 pm). So, they are not being run off their feet.

The original conclusion still stands. Overpriced.

Visit 3:

The things I do in the name of science!! The other day I was in Hornsby Westfield about to buy some groceries when I felt the need for a massage. So I called in here for a third visit. This time, I opted for the 90 minute oil massage package ($140), to see if that is any different (for the sake of rigorous research, you understand). The lady was Shain Ming again. Still all dressed in black, but with a skirt instead of the shorts this time. This time we were in the (slightly) larger room in the back corner of the place. The fit out was basically the same, just the thin foam mattress on the floor, but because the room was a little larger, I didn't have to leave my boots outside. There was some quiet Thai (I assume) background music, but whatever soothing effect it was supposed to have was negated by the rumblings of the clothes dryer in the next room.

So, the same drill as previously  I disrobe, lie face down and she massages. Again, I would describe the massage as medium. There was not a lot of pressure there. When she massages my thighs, there is some brief "accidental" brushing of the sack and crack region. Time to turn over and the massage continues with head and neck, arms, chest and then to the legs. She works her way up my thighs, then begins to caress my balls before rubbing the underside of Little Evil. Additional oil is then applied and the tug proper commences. No additional toll is discussed. It appears that it is included in the 90 minute package.

I am able to reach under her skirt and grasp a buttock, however the more interesting bits stay out of reach. I move a hand towards a breast, but am met with a polite smile and a shake of the head. The tug technique is good but I have had better. However, as I approach the edge, something causes her to stop and ask if I am OK. I suppose it was some involuntary response of my body she saw. I assure her that I and, so the tug continues. Then the same thing happens again, and again. So the happy ending does not happen!!

Again, there is the cup of tea and a bikkie afterwards, with a little chat.

So, I think my research here is complete. I do not think this place warrants my further investigation.

Services: Oil Massage with some "accidental" touching

Value for money/recommend?: Maybe

My experience/comments: This place gives a full body oil massage with some "accidental" touching.  The rooms are small and the mattress on the floor is not great.  But the appeal to this place is the "accidentle" touching.  I can see this appealing to a lot of guys who don't want the rub and tug but can justify this accidental touching as part of a normal massage.  I don't know any other place that is like this so that is why this place would be seen as good value for money for some.

Sparksy, you have no sense of adventure... try getting on a peak hour train, you can enjoy accidental touching with dozens of total strangers. (It's sorta like a glory hole, only everyone is clothed and there's no naughtiness and you can see their faces and you pay for the privilege - well, okay, it's really nothing like a glory hole.)

Hey, I'm firmly with you on this - 'accidental touching' and nothing else for almost any money would do little for me.

Granted, some of the appeal of rub'n'tug at a new place or sometimes with a new girl at a place where this is not always on the menu (eg Linda's Vital Massage at Chatswood) is the "will she, won't she" bit, and as the girl gets close towards accidental touching it ramps that appeal up a notch, but you really want that to be followed by the option of a hj at the very least (with perhaps more on the menu) - but why you'd pay $100 for nothing more than 'accidental touching' (albeit as part of a normal massage)? No thanks.

Give me a very good massage sans accidental touching, so I can just focus on enjoying the massage (and pay a lot less than $100 for a legit massage)  or give me a good message with that touching leading to extras on the menu.

Petespace, I have "been there, done that" at Naree Massage and have posted a summary of my experiences on this forum. Much better value to be had at the Thai massage place in Artarmon or Lindfield. But, today I went to the Lindfield shop and things seemed to have changed. It is still better value than the Naree place. The lady is naked and you get a happy ending for $110 for the hour. Further details to follow.

But even when they get naked, there is still the thrill of the further hunt.

The point I was trying to make is that there would be a lot a guys who would not be able to justify a hj or a naked masseuse.  They would feel that this would be cheating on their partners.  At Naree, they can get some accidental touching and as long as they believe it is accidental then they would be able to justify it in their value system.  I do believe that a lot of guys would fit into this situation and that Naree are cashing in on it. I went there 3 times before I realised that the accidental touching was not so accidental.

Petespace, I can sort of understand your point (but I have no partner so cannot fully understand it). There are cheaper places to go for a clothed massage - Pink Pings at Pennant Hills and Tiandi (and others) at Chatswood spring to mind - and the massage is probably better. Or at least, from first hand experience, that is the case at Pings. There, the tug is optional.

Still, each to their own. And please do not consider this as a criticism.

Cheers

EG

As a local I do frequent this place as the RNT is $30 extra I know its very expensive but it does save a trek into Chatswood or Pennant Hills. The owner is seriously fit late 20's and the most amazing pair of tits the only problem now is she is stuck in Thailand as she doesn't have a visa to get back.

 "Naree Thai Massage" 1/16 Hunter St, Hornsby - ?
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name: Can't remember - Couldn't speak English very well

Establishment :Naree Thai Massage 

Date of Visit: 25 February 2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink:1/16 Hunter St Hornsby 2077 

Hours of Business: 9am till late

Rates:Oil massage 90 mins $110

Age:around 40

Size/shape:slim

Nationality or Ethnicity:Thai

Services Provided:real thai massage and hand job

Value for money/recommend?:No

My experience/comments: I walked in and there were three ladies there - 2 young and one older one.  I went to the reception and looked at the menu and I said I would like the 90 min oil massage.  I paid her $110 cash and she took me into a small room behind the reception area.  The place looks like it has 2 rooms and a curtained off area.  Anyway they said go into the room and put these shorts on.  Then the older one comes in and I must say she is not attractive at all.  Anyway I felt like a good massage so hopefully she was good at that.  She did provide a very relaxing massage.  After about 30 mins she asked whether she could take my shorts off and I said yes.  So now she was massaging me while I was naked but she was still fully clothed.  With about 20 mins to go she asked whether I wanted a hand job and I said yes.  She said $30 plus extra for nude massage.  I think I ended up paying an extra $80.  There is a different price list in the room on the wall which says how much extra it is for nude - or no shorts as she called it!  So I end up paying $110 when I went in + $50 nude and $30 for the tug.  She eventually got to the tug and I have to say it wasn't the best.  No ball play and too much oil.  Would I go back there?  Not to see her but I will probably go back and see whether I can score better with one of the younger ones.

Went back to Naree. Couldn't see any renovations so maybe the sign was put up just as an excuse for a holiday. Got the 1hour oil massage for $100 (which is too expensive), lots of tackle tickle, but then wanted $30 for hj, but refused as $130 all up seemed too expensive. Will try elsewhere.

Being fond of Thai massage and girls in general, I thought I'd give it a try.

Assigned to Charm(ing) who I presume is the same girl as Shian Ming. She wrote Charm
down on the back of the card, so I got that right.

Excellent massage, for the $100, with substantial tackle tickle, with the object of upselling
to $140. As I was on a promise, and thought $140 was paeng mak (expensive) I managed to
decline without exploding. It took considerable effort however - her technique was charming and almost too effective, but I wasnt going to part with the $40.

My experience/comments: Made me feel comfortable, very friendly and did a good job over all. Atmosphere was great. If it werent so expensive would keep going back.

Her massage was soft, and plenty of touching all over. She was very good with subtle touches between the legs and the odd grab of my nuts.

She was not naked but allowed a little touching on her bum, but that's it.

Her hj technique was great and as she continued to massage with lots of touching of my nipples. 

She wore a low cut top so plenty of cleavage when massaging my stomach and upper legs.

Services Provided : rnt

Value for money/recommend? : not really but it is a good atmosphere

My experience/comments : Thursday night - it was the busiest I'd seen it, and seeing an old bugger in there, i wasn't sure if the good service was provided. I stripped naked to show i mean business. She obliged by touching the sack when cleaning me down at the start with a warm washer. 5 min in, she offered for $30 extra. I couldn't leave the shop with full plums - i'm only human. She tugged for 15 min - i was too busy testing her boundaries to concentrate on cumming. No kissing, no bra off, no massage for her, but she has a beautiful smile and said my advances were cheeky.
Overall, it was a very pleasant half hour, though $90 buys a lot elsewhere. The beauty of this place is you can be seen entering the shop without people thinking your going for a root - as opposed to a brothel. I'll probably go back in another 6 months.

Tried this place for the first time on Saturday afternoon. Was greeted by a hot french girl who was probably in her late twenties. I opted for a 60 min oil massage and was shown into the back room with the matress on the floor. Before she left she told me to take off all my clothes and lie down on the matress. Now I was half expecting that she was just the receptionist and that a middle aged Thai women would return to give the massage (could hear her with another client). Was pleasantly surprised when it was the same girl that returned to give the massage. Apart from being naked it was a legit massage (although somewhat erotic as she smeered the lotion on and later washed it off) - but that girl was seriously hot and I kept hoping she would bring up the topic of extras, but alas this did not happen. Would definitely return if I was guaranteed of seeing that girl again.

Hmmm, went here during the week and saw a brunette, on turnover found out that she was wearing the skimpy clothes Boob tubes etc mentioned above. However she told me she was German, and also definately allowed touching above the knee.
Previously here I've found it difficult to convince some of the Thai ladies forany extras, but this girl offered a tug as soon as I turned over.

Agree the price here is too high.

Naree has sold up to the owner of Dulwich Hill, so things are already improving. Only popped in last week and was looked after by Irene who used to work at the new owners other shop in Marrickville prices are $55 for 30 mins $100 for the hour. Still expensive but she gave a great massage and a great hand job at the end. I gave a $20 tip as it was worth it.

Magic Massage

Address: 2B Dural Street Hornsby (pink gate next to the Chinese restuarant)

ph: TBA I will post 

Lady: Happy....yes Happy

Nat: PRC

Age: 40+

Body: Decent for the age with nice little B cuppers and a shaved pussy

Cost: $30/30 $40/45 $55/60 + extras

I was just walking past today and say the pink gate with massage written on it. What the heck I thought lets go in a see what this is. Met by Happy a pleasant Chinese lady that speaks with a very pronounced lisp! Nice clean, new shop only opened only a week with a couple of very clean warm rooms with heated blankets on the bed. Happy does a very nice massage and I was glad I took the good value 45 minute option for $40. Towards the end of the time after Happy had put powder on my back to help clean off the oil the sack rubbing and light touches started, up until that point I thought this might be totally legit. Once she started I started also and groped her arse and tits to see what reaction I would get. Happy didn't mind the attention so I pulled her tights down at the front and fingered her shaven slit whist she pulled me to perfection with a nice two handed tug. Happy was pulling like a trooper and I blew buckets as I frigged her clit into a lather, she keep tugging after I blew and only stopped when I begged for mercy 
A very nice experience from an older Chinese lady $20 for the extra's

enjoy

Its not her shop but she is there every day with a different one helping from time to time according to Happy. The boss has 4 shops including one in St Leonards so could be the one on Pacific Hwy.

Haha Sparksy, I think you may have misunderstood her name.  If it’s the same lady, she is always saying she’s “happy” as in her demeanor, not her name.  She has a speech impediment that sounded like she was trying to talk whilst chewing on a bag of marbles at the same time.  If it’s the same lady, then her name is CoCo 


Person’s Name: CoCo

Establishment:  2A Dural St, Hornsby

Date of Visit:  June 6

Contact Details/Address/Weblink:  

Hours of Business:  10 – 7:30 maybe

Rates:  $30/30 $40/45 $55/60

Age: I have NO IDEA, maybe 50s 

Size/shape:  size 7, med height, slim

Nationality:  MLC

Happy Feet: 4/10

Service Provided:  Massage, Tug

Value for money/recommendation:   Pretty good

Always on the lookout for something new in my locale, I was keen to try out Sparksy’s find at this place the other week.  It’s a doddle to find, there’s a large carpark opposite the Chinese restaurant, and the alley way down the side of the restaurant was lit up pink with “MASSAGE” writ large on the gatepost.  I arrived there at about 5pm so it was getting dark.

Ring the bell and answered by an older Chinese lady, who may have been quite attractive in her youth.  I asked her name and she said CoCo (see above regarding names).  She was certainly “happy” to see me as I have a feeling this place is not on the radar yet and I’m betting its been a quiet few weeks since it opened.  She led me to the room (there seem to be at least 2) which was well kitted out, larger than average with a very comfy massage table.  

Laugh if you will, but I actually have a bad back at the moment, and my motives for visiting this place were not entirely “relief” based.  I was hoping for some actual therapeutic work on my dodgy back.  After I’d stripped off and Coco was back in the room (I’d paid for 30 mins as this was a first try) I explained the areas of agony and she was fine with that.  She really wanted to apply that oil that smells like a State of Origin locker room, but with the missus cooking dinner as I lay there, the thought of going home and trying to explain the “aroma” was too daunting, and so opted for just the baby oil, to Coco’s disappointment.

Well, let me tell you Coco’s massage was up there with Ping from Pennant Hills.  She knows her stuff, and 15 mins into the rub I looked up and extended for the hour, with Coco being thrilled and “so happy”.  She really sorted out the bits I’d pointed out, (and today I can truthfully say I feel a lot better) and worked her magic for a good 45 mins.  Then she rubbed me down with a warm towel and sprinkled talc on my back, so she could ever so gently rub her fingers all over, including a fantastic tackle tickle – it was on.

On the roll over I’d realized why I was so comfy – the massage table was heated – bliss.  Coco soon motioned if I wanted the chicken choked, to which I replied of course   She skillfully applied some oil and commenced the tug, while I started to grope her chest and crotch.  Unfortunately she was quite well covered up, but I got her to straddle the table in front of me, and was able to pop out her very nice B cuppers. These were topped off by lovely large nipples.  I was also able to pull her tights forward and het into her knickers, where I found a recently shaved mound, and I was able to tickle her clit a little.

Her hand action continued and soon the seed was sown, all over the place.  Predictably, Coco was “very happy” and so was I.  The extra work on my member plus the grope was worth a lobster.

So, in brief, if you want a great massage and a great tug, Coco isn’t a bad option.  She’s older but her body seems in good nick.  She is hard to understand though due to her speech impediment. The place is clean and discreet, and cheap.  She says she works there every day, not sure if she is the only ML though.  I’ll be back for more and to see if a $50 will get much more extra.  There is a big sign that says NO SEX!!! Which of course is a red rag to a bull for us punters.

Sparkys and Emp obviously have the touch. Visited this place yesterday. Met Coco - pressed a bit for time so only took the 30 min option. I got the oil and great massage. Followed by the towel, talc and tickle but no follow through. . Coco said times up and sat me up, no offer of extras in desperation I started grouping her tits and arse while there was no resistance from Coco, she pointed to the sign saying no sex. I couldn't quite understand what she was saying but I think she was implying that the brothel 2 doors down ( The House ) had put the kibosh on any further frolics. Hopefully others will have better luck.

Shit eh!  Maybe our reports have filterd back to The House.  It's a fine line when we report on extras to advise members but then put the shop in jeopardy.

I might be completely mistaken here. I don't think English is Coco's first language.  I have no Cantonese or Mandarin. These factors coupled with Coco's speech palsy makes for difficult communication. As I said I couldn't quite comprehend what she was trying to tell me. All I really got was customers, no sex sign, brothel. So maybe she thought I was some sort of undercover investigator and was trying to convince me that the place was legit. Maybe I just misunderstood and read a commercial conspiracy into what she was saying. Either way I left with a boner and blue nuts.  LP

Local Punter was probably in there when I rang the doorbell.  Couldnt wait half hour so didnt try my luck. Anyway, it has been previously reported from other massage establishments in the area, that if they offer sexual services the local mafia put the heavy on them.  Hornsby definitely needs a couple of private local workers.

I was there around 1200. Got interrupted twice. First time must have been you BrianB, the second time was by a Chinese lady - I overheard her and Coco exchange words. Then it was back to the ultimately disappointing business. LP

Yep Coco tells me they have been heavied and threatened by the local licensed brothel mafia. If you are lucky enough to have got that service previously from Coco I am sure she will repeat but if she doesn't know you I think she is genuinely scared, fucking mafia arseholes wouldn't want to come in RANTING and raving when I am there, they might get wet when I piss myself!!

Age: maybe 50s

Service Provided: Massage, Tug

Value for money/recommendation Great Massage

I was looking for a good massage as i had a bad back. After reading previous posts wasnt sure i would get anything more but didnt care as i was in pain. Rang CoCo and got an appointment. I arrived and was ushered into a very clean room and people are right she is very happy but hard to understand due to speech impediment. Pleasant lady though. Looks nice for old girl but who needs a glamour when its a great massage your after. I told her of my problems and she offered some special oil with a guarantee it will fix me. Nude up on to table and for the next 45 mins i am massaged with great skill and a lot of pain as she worked on my back and thighs. Powder on next and a nice tickle that had the boy standing proud roll over and asked if i wanted him massaged as well for $20. good tug with plenty of energy. The finish was nice but the massage was excellent and fixed my back good so yes i will go back. If your looking for an erotic experience this lady is not the go but if like me the massage is the important aspect and you get a shot off at the end for a little more relaxation then i recommend CoCo as probably the best i have had and i have had many.

Looks like this place may be closed. Dropped by today as I had an hour to kill and was in Hornsby.

The steel gate at the front was chained shut and there is no massage sign there anymore.?

Bugger

Gave Jenny a call and she was busy.... So no massage for me today. :-(

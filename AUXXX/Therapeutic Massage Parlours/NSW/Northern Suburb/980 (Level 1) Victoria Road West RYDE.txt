Level 1 / 980 Victoria West Ryde is a new 2 Room / 2 Girl RnT has just opened making it the 7th RnT currently operating in West Ryde.
They charge the usual fee $35 for 1/2 and $60 per hour plus the H.E.
The M.L. the SeaRay tested out was over 30 and offered a H.E. straight up and because her massage skills were hopeless, after 5 minutes of useless massaging, I turned over for the fun for $50.
Parking on the southern side is hopeless so I parked on the Shopping Centre side which is a clearway between 3pm to 7 pm, there is a back entrance / exit
With 7 RnTs in West Ryde, this one is nothing special

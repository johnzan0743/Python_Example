My experience/comments: With May officially being TOFTT month, I decided to take up the challenge.

Found this place advertised in the NST in the "Health & Beauty" section. But as many people have found out, this does not eliminate them from having potential when it comes to the offering of extras.

This place is located on the 2nd floor of a small office building, to the right of one of the numerous Asian grocery shops found on Rowe St, opposite where the old hardware store used to be located.

Was greeted by a Korean mamasan named Kim (owner perhaps?). 1st impression was this place was legit, but I thought I would try it nonetheless. Was asked to take a seat in their waiting/reception area for a couple of minutes. Whilst I waited I spotted a couple of Thai ML's wander past, as well as one male one! Wasn't looking good.

Anyway, after a few minutes I was greeted by a young Thai lady. Early 20's, very slim, not beautiful but not unattractive either. She led me down the hallway. There appears to be about 5 curtained off massage "rooms", and 3 fully enclosed. Luckily for me I was shown to one that was fully enclosed. The enclosed rooms had a glass front wall, which was frosted to the 6ft mark then above that it was clear. 2 other sides of the room were proper walls, but unfortunately, the final "wall" which was seperating this room from the next was a floor to ceiling curtain. I could also hear a lady receiving a massage in the next room!

Was instrusted to remove all clothes - except underwear. The ML went away to fetch the oil whilst I made myself ready. The rest...well..was rather uneventful. 1hr of receiving a very good LEGIT massage, no brushing, no tickle, or anything untoward. Due to all the indications, as well as the lady next door I could hear getting massaged, I didn't ask about any extras. Bottom line is I would be extremely surprised if any were on offer at all, and if they were, I would guess that they would not be sanctioned by management.

Anyway, maybe go there if you are looking for a good legit massage, otherwise, look elsewhere.

Cheers,

BAB

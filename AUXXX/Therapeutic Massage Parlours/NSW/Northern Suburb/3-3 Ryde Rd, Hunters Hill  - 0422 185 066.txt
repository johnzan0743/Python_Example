Place: Massage Relief Hunters Hill

Phone: 0422 185 066

Address: 3/3 Ryde rd (at the back)Entrance is right next to a construction site but don't let that bother you.

Hrs: 10.00am to 7.00pm (or they might close at 6.00pm if not busy, so better to book with Amanda)

Name: Amanda

Nat: Chinese

Age: 45+

Looks: 8/10

Size: Slim and lovely

Massage: 10/10

Cost: $35/30, $60/60 ++

This is a very new purpose built  fit out and probably one of the nicest clean shops you could wish to go to. Two ladies on each day but I have had the pleasure of seeing Amanda the owner who does the best massage I have had in a while. Amanda speaks good English so you can easily communicate which parts of the body require her attention and she will deliver a high quality experience. This lady gets it, clean premises with a new disposable and clean towels each time, the place smells great and is private with a bathroom and sink available to wash. Nice clean down with super hot towels, not some dirty old rag and overall a quality experience for no more $$ than some of the rat infested dumps we frequent offer.
How hard is it for these Chinese to be clean? Obviously not hard for Amanda who is a lovely, sweet engaging lady, give her your support I guarantee you won't be disappointed.


Enjoy

My experience/comments : Was passing by this way into the city and having noticed sparksy's review, though it would be worthwile checking out (it was).  As said, there is a construction site alongside, which is likely to be there for a few more months. Entrance is along the side passage and at the back, through a gate

I was greeted by an attractive looking MILF in a red top and black skirt with frills.  She invited me into the rooms. there is one large room, with a massage table and an arm chair, and there is a smaller massage room off the kitchen area.

The lady  introduced herself as Amanda, and we settled on a 30 min session, and I paid the cash, and she left the room while I stripped off. On her return, she asked hard, soft or medium. I usually go for the latter so she began, and the massage was good. Also, as Sparksy noted, the place is clean and gives off a good atmosphere.  Amanda has good english and we chatted happily, after a while she moved to the legs and bum and the tackle tickle began.  I began to stroke her legs, and we discussed extras. Amanda asked for $50 for nude +HJ, but we agreed on $40.  She stripped off to reveal a slim body with size B boobs, and  a bit of flab around the belly, she took her top, skirt and bra off, and lowered her panties to her knees. Her HJ technique was excellent and she did not object to my hand having access between her legs and she appeared to be enjoying the mutual masturbation.  Didn't take long for me to erupt, and she carefully cleaned me off, then fetched a clean hot towel.

There were a few minutes remaining so finished of with a foot massage.  Highly recommended, and I'll be back again.

Hours of Business :    10am  to 7pm

Rates :    $35/30mins  $50/45min  $60/60min

Age :    mid  40s

Size/shape :   Typican asian build , just over 5ft tall

Nationality or Ethnicity :   Chinese

Services Provided :    Massage + nude RNT

Value for money/recommend? :   Yes

My experience/comments :   Noticed from the above posts that this place had re-opened and having had a couple of good experiences previously, decided to call in.  Rung and Amanda said she was available.  When I arrived she greeted me as if I was a long lost friend, giving me a kiss and a cuddle.
I decided on 45 minutes, so she showed me into the smaller of the 2 rooms - this room has just space for a massage table and a chair, whereas the other room is full size  with an armchair.
I handed over the money and stripped, Amanda returned and we got into a clinch and some DFK, and I partly undressed her, then she motioned me to get on the table and she started the tug, after fully stripping herself.  As stated in my previous review she has a decent body for her age, and quite perky tits.  She allows pussy to be fingered although not deep penetration, and squirms quite a bit.  Her tug is good but not hasty, and a satisfactory conclusion was reached.  She finished off with a good massage.   
We didn't discuss price for extras before hand, probably because I had seen her before, but I gave her $40 as before.  
For punters on a first visit I would expect her to start with massage, then progress via tackle tickle to the tug.
She usually has another ML working as well as her, and that day,(Wednesday) there was a youngish Thai girl working, but I believe the MLs are usually Chinese.
Amanda did say that they were closed because she was away on holiday in China, but that's probably only partly true.

I decided to finally check this place out, as all of the review have been positive. I called and booked Amanda after reading the above reviews. Amanda, like described, is an attractive mature lady who has a very friendly demeanor. She asked what kind of massage I would like, and I went with the hard option. Amanda definitely knows how to get the knots out and really loosened my back up. She really gets in there with her elbows. The only downside was that sometimes when he was really pressing her fingers into my back/shoulder blades her nails would kind of dig in, but it wasn't too bad.

After focusing on my back for awhile, she laid the towel on my upper back and sat on it to focus on my legs. She really started to get into my crack/sack area which was very enjoyable and was struggling to hide my hard on. She spent a good 5-10 minutes doing this and it was very nice. After finishing up with my legs, she used a hot towel on my back and began some very solid tackle tickle. After about 5 minutes of this, it was time for the turn over and she started a nice wet tug. She has a very good technique and goes nice and slow. It was a nice build up with two hands and finished with a big shot for her.

The premises is very clean and it's fairly safe to say, it doesn't appear like your normal chinese massage joint. I will definitely be back to enjoy this lady's skills again. She actually reminded me of Ping from Pennants Hills with her excellent massage and tug.

10/10

Value for money/recommend? : Yes. Glad I followed the recommendations.

Was in the area and had always seen the poster board on the roadside when driving past. Parked the car and called. Amanda  was available - so proceeded to book (given the good reviews). I had called previously but she hadn't been on - but had recommended another girl (I didn't take her up on it). 
Walked around the side path and it really looks like you're walking into someone's backyard (haha).
Knocked on the door and an attractive asian lady answered to confirm that I had made the booking. Led me to the room with the armchair and turned on the heater as it was a cold day.

Everything was pretty much standard as previous reviews.
The massage was very good (which seems to be a rarity when going to Asian joints) - even if the tug wasn't on offer, the massage would have been worth it alone.
Amanda has very nice hands and the build up and conclusion of part two was very satisfactory. 

Fully recommend. Don't be put off by the busy road as it's definitely worth it. She did try to recommend me a younger girl next time, but I'm happy with her and would see her again.

So I decided to go and see Amanda because it's been quite awhile and she does give a great massage and tug. After I parked, I walked up to the place and noticed a sold sign out the front. It appears that the owners of the "heritage" house decided to sell up. So I managed to see Amanda and asked her about the sold sign and she said it was very frustrating because she likes the area and customers. She is looking for places around Drumoyne and Gladesville. Hopefully she can manage to find somewhere close to Hunters Hill, as she would be missed if she decided to move on elsewhere in Sydney. As per usual, she provides an excellent and relaxing massage, and again, provides a bloody good tug. I have seen Amanda a few times, and I can't recommend her enough.

My last session with Amanda, she said she will be keeping her number and will be finding a new venue ASAP.
She really likes the area and will try and find something close by. 

I will try and follow up in the new year.

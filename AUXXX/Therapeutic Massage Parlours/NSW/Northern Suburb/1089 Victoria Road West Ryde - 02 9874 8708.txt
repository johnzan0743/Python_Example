Not a review, but I dropped in here a couple of weeks ago and there were two old Chinese women there available for massage. The place looked quite run down, there was what looked like physio equipment in the hallway which was strange. I asked about prices and left. They do offer a body scrub in a bath tub which interests me, but not in this cold weather.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Went here in the middle of the day and the shop was empty. There were 3 rooms, at least 2 had baths. You can pay $10 extra for a bath. I opted for the half hour massage. Off with the clothes and onto the table. Jilly came back into the room and the massage was pretty standard with very little tackle tickle. With about 10mins to go Jilly asked me to turn over and asked if I wanted a HJ. Of course the answer was yes (+20 for HJ) . I was able to touch her lightly until finished. Overall ok and i'd probably return.

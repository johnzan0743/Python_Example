Value for money/recommend?: 6/10

My experience/comments: Went on a Saturday evening and had to ring the bell at the front of the main door. Lady boss came to let me in and ushered me in the room. She turned around and said "Wendy, your turn" and in comes a 30+ 6/10 lady. Nothing to talk about in terms of face or figure. 

Stripped and she asked me how hard you want it? I said hard and boy did she do it hard. One of the hardest I've felt. Very much like those chinese massage in Westfield where they grind it in. Hot towel at the end of massage and she lightly massages my back and flutters her fingers on the butt and balls. Spends a few minutes doing that and says, "Please turn around"

Proceeds with the HJ using plenty of lubricant and ball massage. Allows your hand to roam but she's fully clothed. After coming, she mentions it's her first day.

Will I return for her? Not likely.

Hei BadAussieBoy,

Yes $20. It's hit and miss in this place but I've found it to be discreete and pretty clean. Sometimes you can get really nice girls there. On weekends some ladies offer to do nude HJ for $50

Had Michelle (Annie in 120 Top Ryde) this afternoon, yes she worked at 120 Top Ryde by the name of Annie. This is my 3rd time with her, nice and soft massage as usual plus a good enough HJ to finish off for $20 extra. Still can't get her to take her cloth off, I'm gonna keep on trying  She has a nice personality, enjoyed chatting to her during the session.

She told me Jessie closed down her top ryde shop coz she couldn't find anyone to look after the business for her while she's away (her baby is due this month). So decided to close it down for a couple month. But I think its gone for good, coz there is a for lease sign up.

Size/shape: Short / Medium Built / Puppy Fat

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Light Nude Massage with Happy Ending

Value for money/recommend?: No

Decided to call ahead and ask who was working that day. Got told a few girls, but none I had ever seen before, so decided to just rock up and try my luck. As it turned out it was NOT my lucky day.

May is ok to look at, not pretty but not ugly either. B cups with not a whole lot of form, in fact, a little saggy. She's a fairly young chick with a little bit of an attitude I didn't much care for. We sorted out pricing and for an extra $40 I got a nude massage with hj. Average massage and equally average hj. 

When it was all over I looked at the clock only 40 minutes had passed, even though I had opted and paid for 60!!! No mention or sign of anything to finish up the other 20 minutes and frankly I had had it by that time and just wanted to leave. 

So if you're in the neighborhood, please make sure you avoid May at all costs. 

Ask for Belinda in stead... now there's a girl that loves to please! Will write a review on her sometime soon, stay tuned.

May works Fridays.

Visited this place yesterday. Did a 30 mins session with Vivian the owner, she confirms no more HJs to be offered from her shop.
But saw a ML dressed in sexy blue skirts on the way out, maybe something is on the menu from her.

Establishment : Remedial Massage Eastwood (02 9858 2913)

Person's Name : Tina

Date of Visit : 31/03/2012

Hours of Business : 10 am until 8pm

Rates : $35/30 $60/60

Age : About 45-50

Size/shape : n/a

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services : Massage HJ

Went back to this place as I've had reasonably good experiences here in the past.

Called ahead, but did not recognise any of the names so decided to take a gamble and book Tina.

Got here a little ahead of time and was quickly ushered into a room, closely followed by Tina herself.

She's a very friendly Chinese lady who I believe would be at least 45 or maybe even closer to 50.

Mainly because of her looks (not so much her age) I was not really interested in anything special anymore and decided to just enjoy the massage in stead.

As often with the older (and not so good looking) masseuses, this lady knows her stuff.

A really wonderful massage and ver enjoyable massage. Half way through she offered me a hot stone massage and I was wondering if I was going to be ripped off for extra money at the end, but none of that. 

She came back with a tray of hot stones and really worked to get the sore spots under control in my back and shoulders.

Did not go for any HJ, even though it was (naturally) offered so others would have to comment on that.

Tina works Fridays and comes highly recommended.

Went back to this place as I've had pretty good experiences here in the past.

Called ahead and booked Kayleigh for no other reason than that it was an easy to remember name. I did not recognise any of the others. The girls here seem to flow through and never seem to be the same the next week or two.

The girls all sit in a little tv room on the right when you come in and they all like to have a good look at who is coming in through the doors, so please give them a warm smile  ;-)

Kayleigh used the room straight ahead and it has curtains for extra privacy that weren't there before I'm sure.

Very good massage but not spectacular and I would not rush back in a hurry to book her, but she's friendly and does an overall good job. Others might have better experiences.

Kayleigh works Fridays only.

Post Content: 
Person's Name : Amy

Establishment : East Pde, Eastwood 9858 2913 

Date of Visit : 22/12/12


Rates : 30mins / $35, extras after that

Age : 30..ish

Size/shape : 8 ... flat chest, but tight pussy...but GREAT Job!!

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : B2B / R&T

Value for money/recommend? : YES!!

My experience/comments : Have seen Amy here a few times now so YMMV. But she always looks after me well. Ladies here do a good massage, but the RNT and extras can vary. As I said above, Amy has an ok body, but is really into it. Seems to get off from her job, which is a plus - you can always tell the ones that don't want to be there. Also, they have put signs up on the walls regarding RNT more than they used to, but haven't been since this last visit.

So just to provide a little more info to what's above.

Amy starts with a nice massage, they use oil here which I find to be much more comfortable than those who use without. Gives a massage from head to toe, and really gets into it. I only like a medium massage, and just the right amount of pressure is applied. Only have 30 mins, so at around the 20 minute mark of course asked to turn over Motions for HJ and I ask how much for nude. $50 is agreed on, and away we go. As I said, she doesn't have a great body but boy is she horny today. Managed to get a nice bit of fingering, and she really seemed to like it. Of course, doesn't take long and it's all over. A nice head massage, clean up and I'm on my way.

I know you can get cheaper elsewhere, but I like the thrill of the chase and a decent massage too

Person's Name : Vivian, then Lily

Establishment : East Pde, Eastwood 9858 2913 

Date of Visit : 7 April 2013


Went in and seen initially but Vivian. A nice looking 30-35 years or so. Dressed in more clinical style clothing ie white coat. The place is clean and modern. She didn't want to shut the door to the room and hadn't even drawn the curtain over. I felt a bit exposed so I asked her to shut the door. She was reluctant and she said it was company policy. I asked her again to shut it anyway and she did. She stayed about 15 minutes, although exited a couple of times to tend to new customers. Wasted about 5 mins all up doing this. She then says that another gil will have to come in as a new customer has arrived who wants the rebate. I realised then the reason for the white coat. So after several minutes, she leaves and in comes Lily. A larger, more casually dressed woman of at least 35 yrs. More playful and had a twinkle in her eye but provided a pretty ordinary massage. She offered HJ for $20, but I knocked her back. She just didn't do anything for me. She continued the massage, no TT and when asked to turn over, only skirted (is that the right word?) around the nether region. She finished about 5 mins short. So all up I lost about 10 mins with Vivians exits and Lily finishing early. I tried to say to Lily that it was short but she didn't seemed too worried about it. No tip.


Rates : 45 mins / I think it was $50.

Age : 35

Size/shape : Vivian - 10, Lily 12-14

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : R & T (I guess)

Would I return - probably not.
Some other info while I'm at it:
Whilst in the area, I took a look around. Came across a seemingly straight massage inside a new shopping
centre at 212/62-80 Rowe St. Small cubicle like shop, at end of the shopping centre, a bit stuck on its own. Very old woman, offering half price in April, so $30 for 60 mins massage.

Also on Rowe St, entrance by Rowe Lane, next to the carpark, about midway down Rowe St, above the Meatworld butcher shop, and up some stairs at the back of a building in Rowe Lane , is a massage shop. It did have a sign but I didnt note down the details. I don't think its been reviewed and didn't get the chance to check it out as it had closed when I went back to have a look. The banner sign at the top of the stairs had Korean writing as well as English and maybe some Chinese, so not sure if Koreans staff it. ANyway, just thought I'd throw those extra bits in. If anyone's been there, let us know. I may not get back to the area for a while.

Establishment (if applicable): 1/10 East Parade Eastwood NSW

Contact Details/Address: 02 9858 2913

Hours of Business: (if known or applicable) 11am-7pm

Prices: $25/20mins + $25 for extras

Age: Claims 28, but easily early~mid 30s

Size/shape: 158ish, B~C cups under robe

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: RnT

Value for money/recommend?: as average as you can get. some decent factors in b/w though.

(I think this is the same Wendy from the very first review).

I had a rough morning so I stepped in expecting a genuine massage simply to relax and get my mind clear before afternoon work.

Was showed to Wendy - whose face I noticed is the very definition of AVERAGE. Not ugly, not a looker, but about as plain as you will ever find. She smiled a lot and had a good attitude though.

Paid up, entered the room, stripped, and lied face down. Her massage technique is above average and does a good job. Got to most of the kinks that I needed tending to. Then, near the end, I asked for her name, to which she replied, and then asked softly, if I wanted to turn over. Wasn't expecting it. 

The Tug itself wasn't anything special. Just a standard. But I liked touching her (for which she charged $5 extra due to that was all the cash I had). She has a nice firm ass which is great for grasping. Her skin and breasts are of decent "quality" as well. I'll probably get her to take her robe off if I see her again next time. 

Overall, a good quickie and quality massage, but nothing to go out of your way for. 

To be honest, I saw a dam* hottie masseuse walk into the shop last Thursday and I hoped I'd see her, but it turns out she had to take the day off and Wendy took over. Oh well, deed was done.

Saw Michelle on a Wednesday after work. There were no other ladies around besides the Vivien at the counter. She's the boss and does a good massage but no extras with her. Michelle was wearing a white robe like a nurse and I thought that this would be a proper massage only. Then as she was massaging my thighs, she kept brushing against my balls and I thought to myself that there will be more. After a good 45 minute massage with back walking, she asked me to flip over and that's when she asked if I wanted a nude HE. She asked for $50 and I got her down to $30 and off the white robe and lingerie. She's not a great looker but she's slim with A cup sized boobs. But it was all good, finished me off while grabbing my hands onto her boobs and squeezing them hard.

Vivien's the owner of this place and according to other punters, she used to give HEs but she's stopped and only gives proper massages and if you want more, she'll get 1 of her staffs to come in to finish you off. It's difficult to get an appointment with Vivien as she now owns a ladies spa and she spends most her time there. But I was lucky to get an appointment with her the other day. She's top notch at her massage and she does a very decent back walking technique. However it gets a little annoying when the other girls are busy and she's in-charge of the phone. We were interrupted at least 4 times during this session and she didn't offer any apologies. Strictly massage only and if she didn't have to answer the phones, I'd definitely go back. If you are looking for extras, ask for anyone else but Vivien

She introduced me to Rose and I said i'd stay for 1hr. 70$ Prices are up, but ok for this place as the rooms are clean and the tables are very comfortable. The massage was really very good. She asked me to turn over and asked if I wanted some relief. Of course was the answer. Rose offered to remove her clothes but I declined. The HJ was also nice and I Rose did let me touch her a bit. After I came and cleaned up she finished with a short head massage. overall pretty enjoyable

Size/shape: short/medium height; size 10; a/b cups (my guess) under loose fitting dress; short dark hair.

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Value for money/recommend? Ok. 

I went here purely for massage. It is not far from home and I was stressed to blazes by family issues. Walked across the ground floor foyer of 10 East Parade, to the door of Unit 1 opposite the ground floor entrance and was greeted by Sasa. 

Sasa is young, warm, has a lovely smile, great English, very friendly and chatty. She led me to a curtained room with a massage table. I stripped, put towel around and lay down on my stomach. I asked for and received a medium to soft massage, reasonably well done, with just occasional hints of tickle close to lil rage and all. Only when Sasa asked me to turn over did she hint of extras, to which I agreed to a hj for $30. I sensed more may have been available, but I was happy with that and it was well done with oil.

It is a pity there does not seem to be a shower here. It is always good to shower before and after the event. Sasa is a lovely person to spend some time with. She tells me she only works here Sundays.

Date: Saturday 1st March 2014

Prices: $60/45mins + $30 tip

Age: mid 30’s, my guess

Size/shape: medium height; size 6-8 and b cups (my guess, as Linda wore a uniform-like dress throughout); long, dark below shoulder-length flowing hair.

Nationality: Chinese

Services: Massage and hj

Value for money/recommend? Yes. 

Well, just occasionally, you get lucky. Today was my day and her name was Linda. I rang ahead, was told they were busy (which, when I arrived was true) and made a booking. I’m glad I did as there were customers waiting when I arrived. 

Linda is attractive, reasonably slim, warm, has a lovely smile, very good English and friendly in a slightly subdued, demure way. Once in the room, I stripped off and lay down on my stomach. I asked for a soft massage, which Linda delivered extremely well, with fingers running up and down, missing little in their agile travels. A huge bonus (and boner!) was the way she trailed her beautiful hair along with her fingers. Bliss!

Eventually I turned over and was treated to a hj that was one of the best I’ve had in a long time.  No hurry, no rush; this despite the sound of more customers arriving. In all, a very good experience.

 I shall certainly return to see Linda. She tells me she works here Saturdays and Thursdays.

Yours. Rage

Hours of Business :  10 am-7pm

Rates :   $35/30  $60/60

Age :  Late 30's at a guess

Size/shape :  Medium Height, about size 8  B Cup (just) Long Black Hair

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided :  Massage + HJ + extras

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :  Had read the report by "raging" above, and was intrigued, and as I was in the area, and it was a Thursday I rang to see if Linda was available.  She was at the time I asked about, so parked nearby (RoweSt - 1 hour parking), and entered the establishment, which looks professional, with glass doors.  Greeted by (probably) the mamasan -possibly Vivien, who was dressed in a pink uniform. She took me into the massage room next to the reception area, and said Linda would be along in a moment.  

This massage room, which has walls to the ceiling, has 2 massage tables, I think there are 2 other rooms, not sure what they have.  Linda comes in, looking slim, wearing a nice black dress, just above knee high.

She asked how long I wanted and I only had a limited time so took the 30 min option.  We settled on medium massage, and Linda's massage was pretty good, perhaps not the best, but up near the top category. We chatted a little. Her English is excellent as noted by "raging".  and she said she works Thursdays and Saturdays.

She did the back then legs, and there was a limited amount of tackle tickle, when in the bum area, and about 15 mins in she asked if I wanted extraa.  $20 for HJ and $50 for HJ + nude.  I said $30 and we agreed on $40.  She stripped of the reveal quite a nice body, with just a hint of flab around the midriff. Shapely legs and a nice arse.

Started on the HJ, which was really good, with a nice slow rotating action.   I was allowed to suck nipples and feel her pussy.   It wasn't a rushed service and she brought things to a crescendo nicely.

Cleaned up and there were a few minutes left, which she gave a bit more massage.   I don't know if anything more is likely to be on offer, but if I am back that way on the right day I will definitely call to see her again. Recommended.

Date: September 2014

Age: mid 30’s

Size/shape: tall, size 8 with small-ish B cups

Nationality: Chinese

Services: Massage and nude hj

Value for money/recommend? Okay and maybe. 

After reading 2 good reviews on Linda I decided to come and try her out. She's tall with long black hair and reasonably decent looking. I didn't have much chemistry with her as her English wasn't great. She gave an OK hard massage using her elbows but wasn't 1 of the better ones I received. When it came to turning over, she asked the standard question and I negotiated to $40 for nude hj. She didn't have a great body but pretty nice breasts. She didn't have a problem with me exploring her body with my hands. The hj wasn't great I must say. I was pretty disappointed after reading the 2 reviews on her technique. Perhaps there was a waiting customer so she hurried through it. After she finished me off, she wiped me off, took the money and told me she hopes to see me soon but she's got another customer waiting. Overall, not a great experience for me and I won't return for her.

Felt a little peckish on the way home and stopped by Vivien's place. Kelly was next up the line. She is petite with a slim body. She gave an alright massage not firm enough for my liking. On the flip, she gave the standard line and I said off with it! Her technique wasn't great, she didn't have a good grip. I didn't like that she kept asking how I like it done, maybe others do but I prefer the lady to take charge. Overall it was ok but better options else where.

I have not been to this place in quite some time so I thought that the ML's here have always been good quality. I rocked up mid afternoon and took the punt with the next cab off the rank and was met by the lovely Bella. Beautiful mature Chinese lady about size 6, short and petty smile. She is a little mischievous and definitely knows what she's doing. So I lay down and she proceeds with a solid back and legs massage with long strokes and a little bit of trigger point elbow work. After massaging my legs she began some excellent tackle tickle and was really getting involved with the outside of my ass. Needless to say I was barred up. She flipped me over where she grabbed some
Moisturizer cream (much better than the oil) and began one of the best happy endings I've had in recent memory. Slow and steady with some
Nice twists and wrist work. Few mins later
I was shooting. Definitely recommend Bella. She only works fridays I believe.

My experience/comments : 

I haven't been to this joint in a little while and decided to check it out and reacquaint myself. When I was a silver member, I have posted a few times about this place. I called up Linda and she said there was a new girl today named Nicole. Linda was a little pushy with her, so I thought what the hell, I'll take a punt. Linda takes me to the far room and I get undressed and jump on the table to wait for Nicole. Nicole walks in and first impressions was she was really cute. She came in with a short sailor outfit and had a really cute flirty smile. Genuinely pretty girl. Not the youngest, but definitely in her 30s and no older. She asked what kind of massage and I said soft/medium. She then began a pretty competent massage, and if I asked for harder it would've definitely been quite remedial. After the halfway point, she started some excellent tackle tickle which lasted a good 20 minutes or so. She was really working the tackle from underneath and used quite a lot of oil for my balls and ass. I could've blown right there and then if she kept it up. I was then asked to turn over, and she didn't even talk money. Just went straight into a nice tug and eventually worked me up to a point where I exploded. She said $30 for me to touch and $50 for full nude. I only had the $20 on me today though. Would be tempted to get her naked next session though. She said she only works here Wednesday's. So hopefully she stays on the roster here and doesn't leave after a few weeks. She also said she works in a place in chatswood and goes by the name of Cindy there. I don't have access to silver anymore so I can't dig around to confirm. Will definitely be back.

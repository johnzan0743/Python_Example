I don't know whether to "out" this massage place because of the 4 Chinese massage venues I'm aware of in Epping 3 of them have their own thread and to be honest the others are quite obviously R+T joints being either upstairs or having the usual curtains in the front window and dark rooms inside.  The remaining one, this one, has no thread and looks like a much more legitimate massage parlour -- I've even seen friendly old lady customers in there! -- it's brightly lit and even has the facilities for you to claim rebates from your health fund.

I'm putting this thread here for my fellow Epping punters to say that there is another option out there -- it's honestly not very hard to find (2 minutes in Google will turn it up I'm sure) but I don't want to get the establishment in any trouble as the masseuses I've seen have all said "don't say anything to the boss".

All of the masseuses are Chinese MILFs.  I've seen a few different women and all have offered R+T.  A couple of them were quite happy to let me play downstairs and were quite wet too 

It's becoming one of my favourite places because you get a genuinely good massage, with a bit of fun too.

I'm open to opinions on whether it's better to share the name & address or just keep it quiet.  It honestly is super easy to Google but at the same time I can understand that this review looks a little lacking without an address.

I had a quick look at Google, it might be the weight loss place in Rawson Street that also offers massage, but frankly I am guessing.    I am sure others would like to know about the "other" option you talk about.     If the place offers RnT it is the same as the others IMHO.   This website is all about reviewing the variousplaces/sharing experiences, so please tell us where and let us have some details of your experiences there.

Bent Leg I would say you are right. Lily has been running that weight loss massage place inside the building for years. She used to do me weekly but now just the other girls, that place is where I first met one of our favourites on this site several years ago. I don't go any more as I find the tax to high and there are better options all over Sydney to be explored

Ok -- confirming then it is weight loss the place in Rawson St, since it seems to be no big secret

Suite 38, Genesis Building
74 Rawson St

wingsofdream: unless I'm thinking of a difference place, that Thai place is quite adamant with their signs & notices that no R+T is on offer and the layout internally is just a bunch of spaces separated by curtains that don't even reach the floor so I'm fairly sure they don't do any naughty bits.

thanks b00fa  - yep thought so as well... geez competition must be tough around this area, 4 R&Ts in the space of 5 minutes...

yep that's exactly the Thai place, I was talking about - probably a bit too prominent to be an R&T anyway...

I tried it when it first opened a couple of years ago. I have no recent experience there.

When I was there, yes, lots of signs about no sexual sevices and minimal privacy, a typical Thai.    Definitely no extras.   Good massage though. . Best of the bunch in Epping is Langston Place, but Ping at Pennant Hills is even better.

Lilly's shop is the oldest massage place in epping I have been going there since she did massage up the road on the RSL side many years ago.
on Lilly sadly she only does weight loss treatments and acupuncture these days, her two handed tug would dock a battle ship.While she protested
she was a Dr I think she still enjoyed it.So sadly the quality is not too flash here these days, but if you like the hook line and sinker try Sandy on sunday
or if you have been here in the past couple of years she used the name Alice. Age wise to say 40's would be nice, looks a bit like Lilly (maybe sisters)
body size 10+ tits ok....price wise $35 1/2 $60 1 hr plus $ 50  nude bj I think she wanted another $50 for the box and dice.
Massage for all of 10 mins was not too bad, the main issue here is the rooms.......way too small if you swung a cat in here you'd end up with a bruised
pussy...!!! if only Sandy was as tight as the room, so all the peace and calm at 45 Beecroft rd Ada's shop, to compare again chalk and cheese
but you can get the mouse in the hole here not there...!!! So sadly the standard at Epping is not as high as Chatswood but hey we all know that
sometimes a good young thing comes thru but as soon as they save up their $$$ and buy a BMW they shoot through....ironic don't you think...???


thanks mikeybee

that thai massage place at epping is legit used to see Molly there a few years ago massage with oil on a table (end room) was great
but not cheap I think $89 for an hour...??? I'd say sensual and maybe worth the $$$ but without the hj.......maybe not
I did return 5 or 6 times (10 times free visit) but when I did the maths........owner does have a BMW...!!!


thanks mikeybee

Gents I have it on good authority that a new legit massage shop will soon open in Macquarie park Westfield. Those familiar with the area will see a boarded up shop on the second ramp ( think) it used to be the early learning centre.  Tracy the owner of Kings Touch in Hornsby told me she is opening it in June or July. She said its strictly legit..... But so was kings touch when it opened.  I understand the rent for this type of small shop is $2000 per week.  Work it out for yourself. Fuckin' hell.  She is also looking for another location on a shopping strip rather than a shopping centre so she can look after those of us in need if a special massage that only young Asian students from Macquarie uni can provide emp

EMP I assume you mean http://www.macquariecentre.com.au/ near Macquarie University. The White Pages give the address as Waterloo Rd (Cnr Herring Rd) North Ryde NSW 2113. 
See  http://www.macquariecentre.com.au/ge...of-v5.pdf.aspx for layout diagram.

She may get some of the Uni girls to work there!

That's the place. Not opening for a few months this is just a heads up. Probably more legit than not so girls will be experienced masseur not uni studes.  If she finds a local shopping strip then that's where the fun will be

Now the lovely Tracey is the one I would really like to fuck! She gave me a massage once and I showed her my cock full mast and she ran out of the room faster than Usain Bolt!

Yup that's her. She's a well tasty milf and no mistake but the sight of a mans tool is a step too far.  She's happy for her girls to milk the men though.  I've tried it on a few times and its a no go zone.

Wouldve thought there are way better location to offer both legit and "special" massages.


At least 5 legit massages a day just for the rent if its $60 a pop....

Ok lads this place is up and running. Had a chat with Tracey on my way past yesterday. Opening special $55/60 Looks like a nice fit out and at the moment totally legit.  The girls are all dressed in uniforms and appear to be young Chinese probably students from the uni.  Can't give you the shop number but its on the row of shops on the second ramp from the bottom the one that leads up to big w. or head for the stairs that lead up the middle around the fountain and its near the top if the first flight from ground level (post office level) ill TOFTT ASAP. Tracey did say to me half seriously to not scare the girls just yet. They did look very young  will start a proper thread when I pay a visit unless someone cares to beat me to it

As I mentioned recently, this is a newly opened shop by the same lady (Tracy) that opened Kings Touch in Hornsby,  its been open 2 weeks, with an opening special of $55 for 1 hour relaxation massage. Imperial Massage - Home  Level 1, Shop 19B - Ref. K38

I went there today to TOFTT.  Its so legit they dont even bother with the "no sex" signs.  Strictly fully clothed girls (young Asian uni students it seems) offering legit massage.  I got Keira, possibly Aussie Born Chinese, quite cute.  I stripped down and Tracy wandered past, laughed, and suggested I cover up with a towel at least.  The rooms are small, with heavy curtains.  Tables are new as youd expect.  The massage was ok, nothing special.  The closest she got to my groin was outer thigh!  No flip, just a back massage.  The room was fucking FREEZING, and frankly I didnt really enjoy the whole thing much.  Keira said the heaters were arriving later this month!!  

If you're after a legit massage maybe this place in a few weeks when its sorted properly, but at the mo there's plenty more out there (but not at this location)

Tried on sat saw Kerry small and young, mostly as above just back massage asked for relax massage got hard just kept repeating step 1, 2, and 3 same same, boring
place nice and cold, to be honest $55 special is way too much to pay even at $35 really not worth the (pain) indeed I left early. If only they did what you asked soft relaxing
with oil, would have been happy with that.

Called in for a massage today not expecting anything other than a legit rub. And that's what I got. Totally legit absolutey no extras here. Massage was ok, took the $80/60 with oil option. Typical Thai massage nothing exceptional. Prob won't bother going back but nice enough if you want a relaxing massage.

I was in Hornsby last Friday and had some time to kill, so thought I'd check out one of the massage shops over on the 'old' side of town.  I'd been to King's Touch massage before so thought I'd try one of the other massage places in the parade of shops near the old Odeon cinema.  

This one had a sign out on the pavement advertising thai massage, with an arrow pointing up a flight of stairs.  I'm pretty sure there isn't a review on this place, and from the outside it looked promising so I decided to TOFTT and went in.  At the top of the stairs was an open area with a reception desk, some easy chairs and some doors leading off to the massage rooms.  A middle-aged Thai lady  who I assumed to be the mamasan  was sitting behind the desk, and another thai lady and an elderly white fella were sitting in the easy chairs.  

The mamasan was dressed in trousers and sensible top and my first impression was that it was a legit place.  But I decided to go ahead  the worst that could happen is that I ended up getting a (hopefully) decent massage.  I was asked what massage I wanted from an extensive menu, and chose "aromatherapy oil". At $60 for 45 minutes, a bit more than the Thornleigh/Pennant Hills shops.  I got shown to a decent sized room that has a wide massage table, and was then left to get ready.

I was even more convinced this is a legit place so I stripped down leaving undies on and climbed on the table.  After a couple minutes, in came the mamasan and introduced herself as Aamy (sounds like Emmie).  She was a little on the chubby side and probably late 40s - early 50s (which I don't mind), and was cheerful & friendly.    I asked her if I should leave the underwear on, and she hesitated for a while, then said it was probably best to leave them on. Damn, almost a hint of an opening there.

Gotta say the massage was good, very professional.  I may as well have taken everything off because I ended getting an almighty wedgie and plenty of butt massage.  On turning over at the 30 minute mark, I had a semi that was fairly obvious under the material I guess and she chuckled a bit before placing a towel strategically over me.  She continued to give plenty of upper thigh massage for the rest of the session which suggested more to come, but never quite got any further I'm sorry to say.  

So after 45 minutes, Aamy finished, I got dressed and went to the reception area where I was invited to sit and have some of tea and a chat.   Nice lady and shop - If you are looking for a good massage only then I can recommend it  the service is good and friendly.  Also, they give a loyalty card, which you can keep there to use on return visits.  I didn't ask about health rebates.  

I do have half a mind to go back and try my luck further with Aamy since there were a few pointers that she may have been open to more if she got to know you better (there's something quite enticing about the older Asian MLs, especially when they appear respectable on the surface).  

Really though, I'd probably end up sticking to the Thornleigh/Pennant Hills area which seem to charge a bit less and guarantee a HE

Thanks for checking this out Lungor... 

I asked how long the place had been open and was told 2 years so I would be surprised if it had not been reviewed in this forum before (knowing what an adventurous lot there are on this board!).  

There was no name on the portable sign outside the entrance, it just said "thai massage". So I looked up the address in the trustee old search engine and this is what came up -> https://www.aamythaimassage.com.au/.   There was another thai massage place almost opposite, but since the address and phone# for Dao Ruang Thai Massage are the same it has to be the same shop but under a different name.  And on further inspection on the web site it looks like they do do health rebates

[/QUOTE]

I didn't ask if I should leave underwear on, just took it off to see what would happen as an oil massage is only really any good if they can do your ass bare hehe. Aamy came in and really didn't cover me much, excellent massage with lots of crack and sack brushing but no real work on the goods. Clean off then the flip where she did make a half assed effort to cover my cock. More inner groin work and rubbing of the balls and occasional rubs by of the shaft but when I pointed to my cock and hit her up with it she said No don't do. My take on this is as she is married to the papasan who actually is a nice bloke to talk with she won't do the cock directly but I think if you see her a few times it would get very interesting. She didn't seem to be too fussed when I said I would self service she just laughed, but I didn't want to piss her off on the first time so I just exposed my cock and balls for her to see a little whilst she rubbed away on my lower abs and groin area. Lovely massage and surprisingly well worth the $80 and I will keep going back until she rubs my cock so lets see how many visits it will take! 
So my challenge is out there, who can get a HJ first from mamasan Aamy??

Ladies name: Beauty

Nat: Thai

Age: 30 something

Size: Solid and not pretty

Cost: $80 per hour for oil massage

Service: Lovely oil massage and rubbed my balls whilst I stroked to completion

Called Aamy and said I wanted to book her, when I arrived she tipped me into Beauty saying " her massage is very good ,you will like she will not disappoint you" mmmm OK then my HJ with Aamy will need to wait until the next time. Usual Thai massage wiping the feet and working up the legs, keep me uncovered and spread my legs so my cock and balls were exposed, gave me a good feeling about what may happen. Very sensious massage and got me rock hard without ever actually grabbing the shaft. Clean down and then the flip, not covered again with my hard cock waving in the breeze. Worked the legs and the ass and rubbed past my cock and balls but when I asked her for a HJ, NO can do. OK can I self service and you help me out a little, yes OK and away I went.
Beauty applied the oil to my cock and I stroked away whilst she focussed on my balls and groin area, a massive explosion, gee I have skilled hands and the usual clean up, you tip me a little extra?? are OK Beauty but when i got dressed she was already doing another job and I didn't want to leave it for Aamy to find so I will honour it next time. On the way out, tea a chat and a cuddle from Aamy as I was leaving with a promise that she will do me next time. I have a feeling that self service is the best you will get here, but boy it is actually surprisingly good as the whole thing is a lot more sensual and not as clinical as the usual cheap Chinese tug.
I will be back to test Aamy's limits soon,,,,maybe as soon as tomorrow

enjoy

 Aamy Thai Massage - Hornsby
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Mia

Establishment : Aamy Thai Massage

Date of Visit :  Late March 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Level 1 / 179 Peats Ferry Road Hornsby NSW 2077  Aamy Thai Massage

Phone : 94762625

Hours of Business :  7 Days 10 AM - 8 PM

Rates :  $45 for 30 min

Age : Mid 30 to 40 

Size/shape : Size 8, Short fully  - remained clothed so further intel unavailable.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage only 

Value for money/recommend? :  Possibly - good massage. Maybe more on offer to select punters.

My experience/comments : Decided to TOFTT and visit this establishment as no reviews posted here. Very clean premises but decked out like your typical Thai massage with wood carvings, wall hangings, lotus flowers, incense and new age mood music. Opted for the 30 min oil massage and was asked "Have you been here before ?" - I realize this question is often a lead for extras and probably should be answered in the affirmative but in the spirit of adventure I said "No" and was happy to see what eventuated. Unfortunately no TT, no body slide and no HJ/HE. While my clothes were off, her clothes stayed on and Mia gave a very competent massage with extra attention to my achilles tendons as they have been giving me hell lately. Following the hot towel clean up, I felt very refreshed and relaxed at the end of the 30 min. Given that there are 2 naughty massage places within spitting distance of this place, I find it hard to believe that this is a completely legit operation. Further investigations are warranted and I can honestly say I've been before when asked -  if nothing else eventuates,  I'll at least get a good massage.

Getting it massaged won't help. Best see the GP and get a referral to an Orthopaedic Surgeon or a Podiatrist who specialises in Sports injuries. You need to stop chasing skirt till the swelling goes down....

Or perhaps you need to catch one to get the swelling down,...

I walked past this place a few weeks ago and saw a sign out the front advertising Kahuna and lomi lomi massage on Sundays, so when I got home I gave them a call to enquire.  A man answered, and it turns out that he is the one who does the Hawaiian massage, the girls don't.  Damn! Half the people advertising Kahuna massage seem to be men (maybe they fantasise that they are going to be massaging naked young women with gorgeous bodies), while most of the female practitioners  seem to do women only, and can be very curt on the phone if a man makes an enquiry, no matter how polite.

The man who answered said that he does the massage at the weekends only because during the week he has another job.  It could be that he is the husband of Aamy referred to in earlier posts.

 Aamy Thai Massage - Hornsby
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Dao

Establishment : Aamy Thai Massage

Date of Visit : Friday, 28 February 2020, around midday

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Level 1 / 179 Peats Ferry Road Hornsby NSW 2077  Aamy Thai Massage

Phone : 94762625

Hours of Business :  7 Days 10 AM - 8 PM

Rates :  $80 for one hour oil massage

Age : Mid 30 to 40 

Size/shape : Size 8, Short, slight build, rather plain face - she remained clothed so I cannot comment on breast size or other intimate details.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai. Good English, so no problems in communication.

Services Provided : Non-sexual massage, but with a sensual, teasing element that may have been deliberate. 

Value for money/recommend? :  Yes, for a good sensual massage, with hints of more on offer to regular clients. Bear in mind that legitimate masseuses whose service is purely clinical, particularly Caucasians, charge at least $80 for a one-hour massage, and often as much as $100 or more.


My experience/comments : 

After reading the comments on this thread, and having previously contacted this place about the kahuna massage offered on Sundays (offered by a male, presumably the papasan), I decided to try out the oil massage with one of the ladies.  I did not make an advance booking, but simply walked in, prepared to take pot luck. At the top of the stairs I found myself in a large reception room, furnished like a typical Thai massage place, with a middle-aged Asian lady sitting at a desk with a large computer screen in front of her.  The lady, whom I presumed to be the eponymous Aamy, asked me what service I wanted, and I chose the hour oil massage for $80; she then asked for my name and phone number, which she entered into her computer. I was required to pay the $80 in advance, which I could do by card.  All in all, I had the impression of a well-run, businesslike establishment.

On the wall at the top of the stairs was the usual disclaimer, displayed very prominently, stating "NO sexual services, NO special services", with the NO in large red letters. Next to the disclaimer was another sign, the like of which I have never previously seen in a massage place; this sign showed the male and female symbols interlinked, with the conventional diagonal red line signifying "prohibited" imposed over it.  I did not what to make of that sign; the male and female symbols interlinked generally denotes sexual intercourse, so the sign might mean that FS was not on offer, or it could mean that no sexual contact whatever was permitted.  The same disclaimer and sign were also displayed in the massage room.

Now we all know that most R&T places, particularly those that are unlicensed and need to pretend to be legitimate, display such discleaimers, the purpose which is obviously to allow the management to deny knowledge of any sexual activities that might take place in the room, supposedly without their permission.  Furthermore, massage places that are fully legitimate, those that offer only a clinical massage without any sensual element, generally do not display such signs, presumably because they take the view that there is no reason why any honest person would even imagine that they offer sexual services.  Accordingly, the disclaimer on the wall of this place was not necessarily an indication that my penis would not be massaged under any circumstances.

The receptionist introduced me to Dao, who was standing at the door of the massage room. One we were inside the room, Dao told me to undress and put my clothes in the basket or hang them up.  She did not say anything about keeping my underwear on, which I took as a good sign. She left the room and I stripped completely; I then adopted my usual procedure of standing facing the door with my penis full erect, which I do to gauge the masseuse's reaction. Dao knocked, and then entered the room; there was no visible reaction on her part to the sight of my erect penis, which I took as a positive sign.

I asked Dao whether I should lie on my front or on my back, and she indicated that I should lie on my front, which I did. She then covered me with a large towel, and began the usual pummelling and pressing that is typical of conventional Thai massage. After about five minutes of pummelling and pressing, Dao removed the towel, another positive sign, and began the oil massage proper, which had both therapeutic and sensual elements in it. She alternated firm and light pressure, with some stretching, but also giving my buttocks a thorough treatment, and massaging right up my inner thigh, but without her hands straying between the buttocks and onto my perineum.

On the flip, Dao left me uncovered for a few seconds while she positioned me on the table, and then took a small towel and placed it over my erect penis.  She did not just drape it, but tucked it in firmly around my penis, holding my penis with one hand while pushing the sides of the towel under it with the other, and then ran her hands up and down the covered shaft to smooth the towel out.  More smoothing please!!!!  I found this whole penis-concealing procedure very sensual and stimulating, and the sensual elements continued throughout the massage of my front, since she every time her hands moved up and down my leg they brushed against my covered penis, with the towel doing nothing to hinder the transmission of the pleasurable sensations. In addition, she several times readjusted the towel covering my penis, taking it in her hand through the towel.  It was obvious that she was not trying to avoid stimulating me, and that having my penis covered with the towel was a device that allowed her to apply such stimulation without her hand coming into direct contact with it.  Those were hints that the massage was not purely clinical, since in a 100% legitimate massage the masseuse will keeps her hands well away from the penis of a male client.

Despite the stimulation and the hints, I thought it best it best not to suggest that she massage my penis, since it was my first visit and the earlier reviews confirmed that such requests from first-timers are always declined.  However, now that my name and phone number are in Aamy's system, I can say that I have been before, and perhaps can expect a bit more on future visits. I will certainly return to see Dao again at some point, and will ask her not to cover may penis when I am on my back; it will be interesting to see whether she performs the same brushes along the side of my penis when it is fully exposed.  I may even ask to ask her to perform penis massage; judging by earlier reviews it would seem that at the very least self-service is permissible, which is almost as good as having the masseuse perform the act, since to have her observe one's ejaculation, and hopefully be impressed by it, is a large part of the fun.

At the end of the massage, I removed the towel and stood facing Dao, and spent spending a few minutes in general conversation, asking about her life in Thailand and here in Australia. Then it was time to get dressed and leave the room.  I sat in the reception room for a short while, drinking the water that Dao had left for me, but she was already back in the room preparing it for the next client, who was also sitting in the reception room chatting with Aamy.  Since there was no-one to talk to, I quietly left.  I will be back to see Dao, who now knows me, and I will perhaps try to see Aamy herself, with the aim of trying the same procedure.

I've seen Dao a few times and can confirm extra is available, she lets me play with her tits while she is giving a reasonable HE. She is new to the industry and to be honest her massage technique is pretty average. 

The nut to crack is Aamy, her massage technique can only be described as frustrating! It's really good and so is the TT, she gets her hands sliding underneath from all directions and you get the slightest touch and a bit of ball stroking, it's amazing! By the time she asks to flip over you are rock hard, been there enough times she doesn't bother with a towel anymore. Once your on your back the inner thigh massage continues and a bit more ball stroking, she then pours oil on your dick and says "you do". It's self service or nothing, I have pleaded enough times but she will not budge! If anyone has the key to unlock the hand mastery of Aamy greatly appreciated. The other frustration now is that she is not massaging as much these days as she normally has three girls on deck and she just runs reception.

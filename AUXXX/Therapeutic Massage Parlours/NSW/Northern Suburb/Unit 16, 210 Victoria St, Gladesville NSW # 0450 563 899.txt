Hours of Business : 10am-7pm (last appt 6:30pm)

Rates : 35/30 60/60

Age : early 50's

Size/shape : average.. not skinny but not chubby

Nationality or Ethnicity : chinese

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : Shit no

My experience/comments : Don't waste your money on Susan and try to book Lily

I decided to TOFTT and go in expecting Lily and another fine ML, but unfortunately I was met at the door by this dragon lady who I assume is the same from Hunters Hill. I never saw Susan when I visted the Hunters Hill shop, as Tina looked after me back then. I was very apprehensive but proceeded and went with the 30 minute option. Terrible massage. She only rubbed her hands up and down and was acting like she was an expert - trying to hit trigger points but having no effect. She would often leave the room, answer the phone and just chit chat to the other ML who I assume is Lily. She tried to do some tackle tickle and ass play, but I kept the legs locked up at the bottom as I didn't want to waste any more money on this lady.

She flips me over after doing my back, and this is where I start stressing out that she may try and go for the tug and pressure me into it. She starts doing these weird massage strokes/slaps on my chest and stomach and then pulls the towel down (which was covering my dick and balls) and started doing another weird groin massage. Thank god I didn't get hard or anything (how could I at this stage?).

As soon as she said finished, I think I've never gotten dressed so quickly in all of my life.

I won't be back here as Julie in Epping is a much better ML who is a lot sexier and does a better HE.

Dropped in yesterday, only to find Lily. She must be a different Lily than mention here, or one of those ladies that adapts her name to a punters request, she was the only one there. I would said nudging 70, but 'I have very good massage'. Had to walk. Gems can be found in the roughest places so it's worth a try a few more times.

Not sure if you are referring to Susan (solid build, circa 50) from Hunter Hill, ex Kathrine Street Chatswood, I understood she open a legit shop in Westfield last year after she sold out.

The SeaRay has now been here several times and the Thursday Lady will take her clothes off, by the way old Susan has some milk in her right breast which is pretty amazing at her age.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0450 563 899 

Hours of Business : 10-9?

Rates : $60/hr + $20 HJ or $50 NHJ

Age : Late 20s

Size/shape : Size 6, beautiful face, A-B cup, slim, short and great ass

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, NHJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

This is two reviews in 1 and the reason is that the first time I saw Mimi, I didn't really see Mimi... read on 

On Tuesday 19th I rocked up to this establishment and while walking up the stairs from the RSL carpark I passed a sweet young thing coming down the stairs.  She asked if I was coming for a massage and when I replied in the affirmative, she told me to head up and she would be with me shortly.  The rooms are small and the walls do not go all the way to ceiling - each is given "privacy" by a large curtain all the way across the front.  If you want a private session, this is not the shop for you.

I walking in and the mamasan there took me to a room and asked me to get ready.  Once I was she came back in and said that Mimi was delayed and she would start the massage...

Uh oh, I thought, I've been baited and switched.

However there followed an excellent massage which was both relaxing in the muscles, yet stimulating of one certain muscle.  The oil used seems to be basic non-scented baby oil and so this won't be a problem for those stepping outside their comfort zone.  The mamasan (whose name I didn't get) is a reasonably attractive chinese lady in her mid-late 40s.  I cannot describe her body as she never got nude.

Eventually Mimi came in and I was treated to a brief 4-hand massage (BONUS!!) before Mimi got a call on her phone and had to leave again.  The mamasan seemed irked by this and explained that Mimi was "moving her car", yet she continued with the massage and even began a pretty good HJ.

However Mimi returned, the mamasan left, and Mimi whispered if I wanted a NHJ to which I said yes and agreed to the fee.  Mimi was naked in a flash, showing a lovely little body and her HJ technique was superb for someone so young.  I was soon painting the ceiling with my spend.  Mimi seemed impressed and asked if I had a girlfriend...a standard tactic, but one I like 

Then she continued the standard massage and we had a lovely chat until time was up, I promised to visit her again on Sunday.

---------------------------------------------------

Which I did! :P

Not to much to add, except that this time the massage was ALL Mimi and it was excellent.  She is quite strong for a young girl and the massage really got all my knots sorted out.  This time she didn't even ask, but nuded up as soon as I turned over and got me over the line in record time (see some other reviews I am posting today as to why this means she was so good).  On leaving she again made me promise to visit again next time I in town.  Hell yes, I will!

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : I went to Gladesville Massage Right on a Sunday afternoon after a couple of wines.  I was first turned away to get cash out - there are a few ATMs around so that was easy.  Upon returning I paid my $60 and was shown to the room  I had a feeling they did HE but it was my first time so I wasn't so sure.  I stripped down to my jocks which she pulled off "because they use oil"  Massage was great, better than most legit places.  A bit of tackle tickle and I couldn't help but lift my hips up to give her a better view.  After about 40 mins she asked me to roll over and then asked if I wanted nude hand relief for $50.  A bit strapped for cash I opted for just hand relief for $20.  She oiled me up, started stroking and I came within minutes.  She wiped me clean and finished out the hour with a head massage.  Great first time, looking to visit again this weekend.

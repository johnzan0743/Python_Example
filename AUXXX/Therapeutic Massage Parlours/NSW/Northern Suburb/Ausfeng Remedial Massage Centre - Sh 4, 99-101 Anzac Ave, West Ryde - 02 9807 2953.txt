Person's Name: Cindy

Establishment: Ausfeng Remedial Massage Centre

Contact Details/Address: Shop 4, 99-101 Anzac Ave (Cnr Victoria Rd) West Ryde; 02 9807 2953

Hours of Business: 10am to 6pm (according to business card but ML advised they are usually open to 7 or 8pm if busy)

Prices: $35/60 30/60 mins

Age: 40+

Size/shape: Medium build

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend?: OK/Maybe

My experience/comments: This place is at the ground floor of a block of units, just up from the Officeworks heading back towards West Ryde station.

Must have been past this place hundreds of times, but was only detected by my RNT radar a couple of weeks ago when I spotted the "Massage" signs when sitting in the relaxing Victoria Rd peak hour traffic. Apparently it has been open for about 2 years.

Anyway, finally siezed the opportunity to TOFTT today. From the outside the place looks like a typical RNT place, from the inside it looks like a typical RNT place, and surprise...surprise... it is a RNT place!!

Entered this place and was greeted by Cindy who I think may be the mamasan. She leads me to one of 3 rooms, and confirms how long I would like to stay - took the 30 min option for $35. Cindy returned with my change, and asked me to take my clothes off and lie down on the table, as she left the room again.

The rooms are very typical for a Chinese RNT - table in the middle, shelves with all the tools of trade, walls all the way to the ceiling, locks on the doors & appeared to be quite clean.

Another lady returned. Only caught a glimpse of this lady when I entered - 40's, medium build, just OK looking. Cindy was of similar appearance, but this ML was probably better looking.

Anyway, the ML whose name I do not know executed a competent remedial massage of my neck, back and legs. There was no brushing of my boy bits at all. After what was probably about 20-25 mins she left to get a warm towel to wipe me down. However it was actually Cindy who returned to towel me down. She then started massaging my legs again, with some very slight brushing of my manhood along the way. After about 5 mins she asked if I wanted a head massage for about 5 mins to finish off. Even though her looks were not attractive to me, I was keen for a HJ so I asked the question to which she replied yes. I asked how much and she said I could decide.

Cindy oiled me up and went to work. Very good technique, the only challenge I had was imagining it was a cute little 20 yo hottie doing the 'job'. Got over the line with little fuss.

On my way out handed Cindy $20 for the HJ, and she asked me to wait whilst she got $10 change for me - I asked to her to keep the $20 which she did.

Would I go back? Probably not if you are after a hot young thing to admire while she jerks you off. However, if you need a good massage, have a sackfull (and the HJ may cost you only $10 extra), and looks & age are not your No.1 priority then it is reasonable value.

This is a posting on AUFENG I posted on MHG in October 2010 when I discovered this legit Massage Clinic
Some time ago after Linda GU in Herbert St was closed down (because of her Fucking & Sucking the Customers instead of massaging them as per the Council Approval) I tried out this little gem on the corner of Anzac Ave & the junction where Rydale Rd hits Victoria Rd....the first time I visited, there was plenty of tackle tickle but no hand job even though I was full in the raw....the second time I went for a Massage & a Facial...I was fully nude and had the massage first then she put a towel over my willy and did painted the gook on my Face including putting slices of Cucumbers over my Eyes, after a while the MILF came back in to the cube and gave me a very strong Hand Job...on my next visit after shopping at Officeworks where I often leave my car.....I enjoyed a nice RnT...indeed this is a handy little 3 room establishment......note there is nothing else available as they are running a legit massage business.
Now the SeaRay has an interesting story, about a fortnight ago a female Doctor of Chinese Medicine came to see me about some business, she has a proper Chinese Herbal Clinic in China Town and I asked her about the sore mussles behind my thigh, as she lives near by, She said she does Massage in her unit and I arranged a time and she did an interesting massage in her flat. I was totally nude and she did have a towel covering my middle area but in some of the positions she got me into, the towel fell off and she saw my Penis but did not flutter...Soon conversation on circulation followed into a discussion of the Penis and why it some times does not work and I told her after 30 Years of Marriage and now that Mrs SeaRay is not so tight anymore I some times need a booster to get a stiffy and she said she could fix it up with Chinese Medicine or Massage of the Passages that run from the brain to the penis, the passages that run from the nipples to the penis and the passages from the foot to the penis so that sounded interesting so we made an appointment for Yesterday in her China Town clinic..so unlike the previous massage in her home, now I was in her Clinic and as the appointment was for attention to the Groin & Penis I was standing in front of her fully nude and she was explaining the preassure points etc. Now this is amazing she massaged my back, my legs, My bum, under the testies and after turing over she massaged the passages to the penis and it was growing....but she did have a towel over me and several times she touched my cods but mainly she used a towel, at one stage she held my penis tightly and massaged it like she was trying to pull my cock out of my body. Later on my penis was large and I wanted to blow but she say hold on, don't go and she showed my how to have Mrs SeaRay massage it but I wanted to blow and she say NO..(a great Penis Massage that I will continue in a new section to be followed)...........NOW it's late Friday and I wanted to blow but I thought I need a RnT where I know there is a Chinese Doctor of Natural Therapies who is also doing RnT and I knew AUSFENG has only Mature M.L.s and often a Doctor of Chinese Medicine working there so off I went in the pouring rain.....in came Suzanne a cute Chinese MILF in skin tight Tights showing a huge Camel Toe and is a Doctor, so after paying the $50 I told her I have a problem with my Groin & that my Penis does not work...no plomblems in her broken English I fix for you and what a massage, she spent 40 Minutes following the chanels down my body to my Penis then up from my Toes to my Penis flipping the sack up to massage under my groin then to the organ itself, nice and slow strokes and finally working on massaging my Penis which she said said she would fix. Now I did try to ask her at the start if she did sexy massage but she only touched my cock and said she will fix so I didn't try to touch her as she was doing a great job touching me.......then back to the story....the fireworks and finally at the hour I blew, after the clean up I gave her the usual $20 BUT chaps, there is nothing else available here except a good HJ......I will start a new thread about medical Massage in the Chinese Herbal Clinic's   cheers SeaRay

On Searays advice went down here today to get my floppy penis played with. And old Chines GILF with skin tight pants took my hand and lead me into a room. I stripped and when she came back in I pointed at my stalk and said can you fix this no good not working, she laughed and said lay down. She spent the next 30 mins as Searay described above rubbing all around the area and giving me a spectacular ball massage which was so hard it should have hurt but strangely didn,t.
While the good doctor played with me I whipped her tits out and sucked on those old melons, she moaned and really seemed to like it. Pushing the friendship I reached around and grabbed the waist band of her tights and quickly pants her in one motion, expecting a hit I closed my eyes but she didn.t flinch and continued with the ball massage. She enjoyed a very nice fingering and having her clit played with as she got me over the line, she really seemed to enjoy the attention as she was VERY wet and it has probably been a while (about 40 years).
Anyway I was rock hard as she finally started playing with the shaft and rubbing the head and blew a very satisfactory load that caused loads of laughter from the GILF. All in all fucking spectacular and if you could find one about 30 with a smokin hot body that could do the same thing that would be punting nirvana. $50 all up for a satisfying Saturday afternoon relaxation therapy.

cheers

Fuck SPARKSY I am jealous, for a GILF her Tights are tight exposing her "Camel Toe" pussy which is quite large (meaning her flaps) I wanted her to take her top off but didn't think it was right at the time, I think the good Doctor of Chinese Natural Therapies would be a wild root even thou she is aged and she is much hornier than the Chinese Doctor I had been visiting in the CBD but I do not think this is achievable..............

Needing a rub, I popped into AUSFENG yesterday and CINDY (the owner) provided a very nice $50 massage which include lots of brushing of the tackle and once the conversation steered into the direction of old age and there effect on the Male Penis it became interesting but it was unfortunate that the Doctor SUZZANE is in China until the 30th March who Cindy said will fix and make it stiff

Person's Name: Suzanne (But alas not the Suzanne mentioned by Searay)

Establishment: Ausfeng Remedial Massage

Contact Details/Address: Shop 4, 99-101 Anzac Ave (Cnr Victoria Rd) West Ryde; 02 9807 2953

Hours of Business: 10-6 7 days

Prices: $35 half $50 hour another $50 for HJ and strip

Age: twenties

Size/shape: size 8, b cup

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Massage and naked HJ

Value for money/recommend?:  Not really

My experience/comments: On arrival - Are you Suzanne (looking forthe doctor)? yes.   Took one hour.    Have a problem with bentleg junior not straightening.   I can help.   So far so good. 

Massage was just gentle stroking, not real massage, with plenty of ball tickle. About now I realised this is not the doctor mentioned by Searay. 

At turnover offered HJ for $20, with strip for $50.   A bit dear for the strip but she was pretty and I wanted to see, so yes.   Allowed touch of breasts and delightful nipples, also pussy and pussy tickle.    Also succeeded with the finger twice although she stepped back both times. 

Massage 3/10
Body 8/10
HJ 6/10

In summary a less than average chinese massage. 
Next time I will ring first and book the Dr Suzanne or Cindy.

If you want a good massage by an old chinese grandma then this is the place.
Two old girls working. They do a good massage for $35 for 30 mins.
If you ask they will give you a HE for free.

The old girl was looking at the ceiling as she tugged away
 and not much was spoken during the ordeal.

Good for a massage otherwise look elsewhere.

My experience/comments:

So I decided to visit this place and I've heard has been compared to pink ping's in pennant hills, so I had to try. I arrived about 10 minutes early for my booking, so I waited in one of the rooms until Cindy was ready for me. Massage starts and let me say, she gives a solid all round massage. She's definitely up there in the massage skills, I would also compare her to ping from now on too in that respect. Now she has a tidy rig for an older bird and what I don't understand is that a lot of people have said Cindy is 'really' old, I don't really think so. I'd say she's older than most but still young enough to have a good time. Anyway, upon the end of the massage I asked if she offered HJ and she did for tip. I turned over and she started off with a decent tug, then her technique got a little too fast and I kinda lost it after that and I didn't get to finish. It was kinda funny at the end because she was like "you a big strong man, maybe we do this part and see if your cock still work at the start next time, you see me next time again". So maybe she does a better job with more time to spare and maybe she'll try some weird penis exercises on my cock. I'll be back soon to try it out. Will review then.

After reading the reports about this shop I decided to check it out last Tuesday. It's very easy to find and there is plenty of street parking around.

I walked in and was greeted by a plumb Chinese lady with short hair who was probably in her 50's.  It didn't look like there was anyone else around but her so after seeing what was on offer I made a dash for the exit.

Horses for courses of course but I would not go to there for a massage even if I was getting paid for it. I'm always up for a massage from a nice Chinese milf but this was not even a gilf.

I'd love to hear from other punters who have been here before and might know if there are other ladies around and which days they are working at this shop.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, and yes

My experience/comments : Quick business trip to Sydney and decided to stop in as I was staying not far from the establishment. It was late afternoon and all girls bar Cindy had left. Cindy is an older gal, 50 odd maybe and delivers a fantastic massage that will leave you tender and free of muscle fatigue. She isn't afraid of getting in those tight spots around the tackle and gently works you up for the 'roll over, would you like massage there?' line. HJ is at no extra cost, however I offered a cash tip as I was very pleased with the massage and the finish and thought it would be polite. 

Cheers,
BE

Services Provided : HJ
Value for money/recommend? : So-so

My experience/comments :

So I decided to drop in into Ausfeng to try out Kelly for the first time, booked at 6:30pm and opted for the 1 hour massage. She is rather average looking, so initially I was a bit dissapointed, but her friendly attitude and decently good massage (with adequate fondling on my part) changed this. I would like to point out that the session was not interruption free as there was the phone that was constantly ringing, and she had to duck out to attend to people walking in, this was one of the drawbacks of this place, as there is no receptionist, the ladies will have to attend to customers who will ring/walk-in. So after a good massage, she proceeded to ask me to turn over and ask if I would like a HJ, to which I accepted shortly after a brief negotiation (she wanted $30, I counter-offered $20, she accepted), I popped out her tits (which were quite large, although she did have a fair bit of tummy) n sucked them for all they were worth. Her HJ technique was however not the best, and was slightly rushed, and there was no hot towel cleanup.

Would I return? Probably not, I would rather try out Cindy/Suzanne.

My experience/comments:

Massage here seems perfectly legit. Suzanne looks pretty old with short hair. She has a very very basic command of English. If I ever need a proper back massage I would come back here as she's very very good. My back felt a lot better after the massage. However there seems to be nothing extra. She didn't even allocate time for me to flip over. When the 1 hour was up, she just told me it's done. No flip over or anything. Not sure if she I would have been able to maintain a hard-on even if I had flipped. She looked fit in her trainers but not really a looker.

Suzanne with the huge interesting "Camel Toe" is a Doctor of Chinese Therapies and does also a very good Penis Massage to those who mention that you have a problem with E.D. and getting an erection. I was going to cut a paste my posting, but flick into Ausfeng. I still pop in and all the Ladies here will do a fantastic massage and H.J.

Person's Name: Michelle

Establishment: Ausfeng Massage 

Date of Visit: 19th January 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 4, 99-101 Anzac Ave, West Ryde, NSW. 02 9807 2953.

Hours of Business: 9am till 7pm 

Rates : $60/ 1 hour 

Age: 40's

Size/shape : Medium height; size 10; smallish boobs; long shoulder length hair, which she pulled up; more than this I cannot say as Michelle was fully clothed throughout.

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided: Very nice, gentle massage.

Value for money/recommend?  Yes, for massage.


Based on recent reviews, I decided to visit Ausfeng for a massage, which if properly done, is wonderful. Michelle greeted me at the door (more on this later) and I took the 1 hour option. Undressed (sadly, no shower), towel around middle, I asked Michelle for a gentle, relaxing massage, which is exactly what she delivered. She started with legs, then back, shoulders and eventually I turned over for neck, stomach and legs: but not feet, as I’m mega-ticklish! As the massage progressed, we chatted very comfortably. Michelle’s English is good; she has lived here for a number of years. I got the sense that if pushed there might be more on offer. But with funds seriously tight and the massage going so well (at one stage I fell asleep!), it seemed inappropriate to try to push the boundaries (old fashioned am I?). At the end a hot towel rub down and hug before leaving.

The one drawback was a periodic stream of interruptions from the phone ringing and customers walking through the (clanking bell alarmed) front door, which together somewhat broke the mood and ultimately began to give me the shits. Looking beyond these distractions, Michelle did a great job. Will I be back? Yes, provided someone else handles reception. While I saw Michelle on a Sunday, she told me in future she will be working only on Thursdays.

Ausfeng is good for a massage. I went about a week ago. I can't remember the ladies name. ( i Think Anne) She was about 50yrs old. Size C breasts which I was able to fondle as she gave me a HJ. When finished I did say to myself wtf am I doing fondling these breasts and having this lady pull my cock. Oh well it did feel good and i'll probably be back. I gave a 25$ tip.

I haven't been here for a few years, but timing and geography worked out to spend a lunch break at AusFeng with Michelle. She is a 40ish Shanghai lady, not a beaut, but quite pleasant, medium build with a little belly paunch and a/b cup naturals. 
We were alone in a slow shop to start, and she did a pretty good FBM. Her boss had gone to do a little shopping  which almost guarantees interruptions. Just as we were getting to the fun part of the hour, phone and the doorbell starts ringing. Fortunately, help arrived returning from shopping and she concentrated on me. 
Upon the flip we discussed the next items on the menu. I requested the full monty, but alas, no FS was available, and anyway, she said she had no condom (note to self, come prepared). However, she offered nude BJ if I was rounding up to the C note leaving her the change. Mmmm knowing this must mean sans skin, this would work for me. 

The kit came off and she looked ok for her years and she proceeded with a nice little bare back hummer. Another punter had arrived and I was properly quiet in stealth mode, partially to see what would happen during the big moment. Nope, no gentleman me; I gave no warning and surprisingly she did not anticipate a big shot. Once I came, she stopped sucking but didn't miss a beat, and kept stroking. Like the Collective Soul song, only turned her head to spit me out. No recriminations from her, she got the hot towels and we chatted pleasantly while I dressed to go, leaving as a satisfied customer.

WARNING Gentlemen who like the AUSFENG ladies very good massage...... if anybody else does receive a little extra service apart from a happy ending from one of the Ladies as posted above PLEASE DO NOT POST ABOUT THE EXTRA'S

RYDE COUNCIL ARE VERY STRICT and if they get a whiff of any hanky panky they will close this shop down quick smart as they have done with others who offered more than a therapeutic massage. Cindy & Doctor Susanne provide a very good proper massage and if one does get a bit of penal relief, they are lucky but please don't post it here

Person's Name: Kelly

Establishment: Ausfeng Massage 

Date of Visit: Sunday 2nd February 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 4, 99-101 Anzac Ave, West Ryde, NSW. 02 9807 2953.

Hours of Business: 9am till 7pm 

Rates : $45/ 45 mins 

Age: 40's (my guess. Kelly has an almost “angelic” face and lovely, genuine smile and gorgeous big eyes that together make her look quite young; but as the massage progressed it became clear she is older than younger)

Size/shape : Quite short; short, close cropped dark hair; size 10, a little chubby maybe; b/c cups. More than this I cannot say as Kelly was fully clothed in a white uniform/smock (?) throughout.

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided: Massage.

Value for money/recommend? Yes, for massage. But, the interruptions are a real downer!


Kelly greeted me at the door and I took the 45 minute option, as money was limited. I was really wanting a nice, gentle relaxing massage from a lovely lady with caressing, smooth stroke hands (yes, I did a massage course many years ago) and that’s exactly what I got. Kelly ushered me to the room right near the front door. Bad move (see below). I undressed, opting for the towel around middle rather than leaving underpants on. Once face down on the table (with head in hole!), Kelly started with my back (no oil: I hate the stuff; just natural) then shoulders and thereafter down legs and feet. Kelly’s English is good. Soon we were chatting comfortably, which helped me relax deeply into a most enjoyable time. At some point she asked me to flip, which I did towel intacto. Looking into Kelly’s eyes, seeing her smile and admiring her beautiful tits whenever she bent over me, was a sheer delight. Lil rage, to his credit, recognized we were in the company of a lady (if rather spunky one at that) and both of us were content to behave. At the end a quick towel down, hug and out the door.

As I’ve mentioned in my post above about Michelle, the one thing that shits me about this place is the steady stream of interruptions from the front door chimes clanking as someone walks in or the phone starts ringing. In both cases Kelly felt the need to respond. Maybe that is good for business, but if it is likely to be a feature of future visits here, I won’t be back, as each interruption completely breaks the mood of an otherwise very relaxing time. Owner, please note! Kelly tells me she works weekends only.

My experience/comments : Well I felt the need and returned. Saw Michelle, She is new. At first I thought she was pregnant and said to myself this is a bit weird but why not. But instead she was just had a flabby stomach. The massage was nothing special. Cindy gives a better massage. But  when she started feeling my balls and cock she did a nice job. I turned over and she started pulling but nice and slowly while i started to feel her ass and tits. She offered to take off everything but i don't think i would have enjoyed that so declined the offer. Finished up and paid 20$ tip. Overall If you want an ok massage but a good HJ then I recommend.

Went to Ausfeng hoping to see Anne. Apparently she doesn't work there anymore. There was an old lady that tried to shuffle me into one of the rooms. She must have been 65 years old. I just had to turn around and go. I just couldn't stay. She'd have to pay to touch me.

Gentlemen, AUSFENG is not a sexy massage parlour, it is a proper massage clinic where most of the M.L.'s are very experienced from China and some are actual Doctors of Chinese Therapies.
Ausfeng does NOT have young M.L's so don't go here if you are after a youngster and remember  The OLDER and UGLIER the Massage Lady here, the better the Massage is and their Happy Ending

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Remember this being mentioned a long time ago as one of the favourite places, but there doesn't seem to be much about it when I try a search (other than location). Decided I'll try it out. Rocked up - door was open and only one lady was there who introduced herself as Susan.
In the massage room, Susan only placed tissues where one's penis would lie and not anywhere else. On the walls were a price list and also a sign saying "No Sex". Opted for 45 min - Onto the actual service, I must admit that the first 5 minutes were not that great - i was thinking Melisa from Meadowbank was better, but those thoughts were immediately dispelled as the rest of the massage was very good. 
The phone rang a few times, but it was ignored (well except for one time which had a different ring tone). 

And with that, the session was over, no flip-over or question or anything. I was asked if I had been there before. So not sure if this place has gone straight or I didn't do the secret wink but would be interested to hear other people's experience.
Building is in the corner of a residential building with commercial units on the ground floor.

My experience/comments : I started a new job a few weeks back and have been drive home along Victoria rd and eyed this shop as I left the offices work, I had not tried a different RnT for a time was why not, I was welcome by a mature and told 5 mins wait so ok in to the front room and given a cool bottle of water (nice touch) as it was blowing a nice wind out side but warm and no air in side, 
So after 5mins a very old lady comes to get me, into the room and she asked if I have been before and I ask no, as on to the table and she starts a good hard massage, getting on to the table knees, and all, she did a great job, so after 45 mins with no play I get the "turn over please" " you want hand job" I ask yes as I did not want to be rude but I was not sure if I would get hard, she said what you pay" I said 30 she said ok, so off with her top but she left her old cotton panties on, and I must say a good tug, I did have to shut my eyes but she did the job, so all up a nice older lady, great rub and a fair tug, I would return but on a cooler day.

I’ve not been here since early 2014, so decided to give it another go. Michelle greeted me at the door. She was busy, but ushered me into the small room directly opposite the front door. 15 minutes later, she reappeared and I moved into the next room along. There is no shower, but the room itself, dominated by the massage table, was adequate. I took the 1 hour option. I asked Michelle for a medium to gentle, relaxing massage, which she delivered to perfection. There is no question she is very good at delivering a very professional massage service. As the time drew to a close, she finished with a slow, excellent HE. Thereafter a quick  clean with a hot towel, dressed, a hug and out the door. 

Yes, I’ll be back to see Michelle, who tells me she works there Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

Was the happy end included in the $60?  When I visited there last year it was $20 extra over the base price of $35 for the half-hour.

By the way, the lady who massaged me was old and ugly, and I fully agree with Searay: the older and uglier the masseuse, the better the massage and handjob.

Person's Name : Katie

Establishment : West Ryde Ausfeng Massage

Date of Visit : January 29th 2017

Contact Details/Address: 02 9807 2953, 99-101 Anzac Street West Ryde

Hours of business: 7 days till 7pm

Rates : $35 for 30 minutes + $40 NHJ

Age : Early Twenties

Size/shape : 8 (a little puppy fat) 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage only + NHJ

Value for money/recommend? : Recommended

My experience/comments:

Katie works Sundays only, and is unusually young for this place, she has been there 5 weeks now.  She has perfect English and is currently studying in University, so I'm guessing that this is a bit of a toll on the side to help with expenses. Her massaging is quite good and it's unclear whether this is from previous experience or whether Suzanne has been coaching her.

On the turn was offered a hand job on my first visit with a fare of $50 if it was naked, on the second visit I was told was only $40 so who am I to argue it sounded fine to me.

Katie reminds me very much of the Singaporean girl that you would see on the street, pretty with her wireframe glasses, loose T-shirt and shorts, it wouldn't surprise me if she studied there from the accent she has.

The second half of the massage is pretty good, access is available all areas however she does keep her knees close together and her very heavy bush makes it fairly hard to make anything out although with a little bit of pressure applied she reacts with a little bit of squirming. I get the impression that the better you get to know her the more that may be available, but at the same time I think that you would have to put a lot of effort in to get to know better.

Will I return, probably she's a nice girl, easy to talk to and not hard on the eyes.

Person's Name : Cici

Establishment : Ausfeng Remedial Massage Centre, West Ryde

Date of Visit : Sunday 27 August 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 4, 99-101 Anzac Avenue, West Ryde. (02) 9807 2953

Hours of Business : 10am to 6pm 7 days

Rates : $35/$45/$60 (30min/45min/60min) + $20 for HJ

Age : 40s, perhaps 50s; Asian women often look younger than they really are, and Cici did not look old

Size/shape : Short, fairly solid but not fat in any way, very pretty smiling face

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided :  One hour massage, with HJ at beginning and again from about the 40 minute mark onward

Value for money/recommend? : Absolutely, very nice soft and sensual massage, excellent HJ, good attitude, very cheerful and friendly, good price.

My experience/comments : 

I was driving down to Sydney and decided to have a massage on arrival.  I had been to Ausfeng once before, last year, and had had a very good experience, so I decided to try it out again.  The main thing I had liked about it on my first visit was that the masseuses were all mature, with none of the silliness and shyness so often encountered with the very young Asian masseuses; they knew that their job was to give their client's penis a thorough workout, and they did it with gusto.  The masseuse I had had on my first visit had been rather large and very ugly, which I actually rather liked, since it felt as if I was being dominated, almost raped.  She had given me a very sensual soft 30-minute massage, with plenty of tackle-tickle, and her HJ had been very forceful.

It was about 4:30 when I arrived. I parked my car in the street just across from the building in which Ausfeng is situated, and walked up the stairs to the entrance.  The building is a high-rise on the corner of Victoria Road and Anzac Avenue, with residential units on the upper floors; Ausfeng is on the ground floor, on the corner of the building, with one massage room facing out to Victoria Road, one in the middle, and the third facing out to Anzac Avenue.  The entrance is right on the corner, and leads into a very cramped waiting room.

On entering, I saw that there was only lady there, who seemed rather younger than the masseuses I had encountered on my first visit.  She looked as if she was in her thirties, and had a rather nice rounded figure, but to tell the truth I was a bit disappointed, as I was looking forward to having my penis given the treatment by a tough-looking dominatrix.  I told the lady that I wanted an hour's massage, but she said that she could not do it since she was due to leave in only 25 minutes.  However, she said that she would ring her boss, Cici, to see if she would be able to come in to give me the massage.  So she telephoned, and a rapid conversation in Chinese ensued.  The lady then informed me that Cici would arrive in about 10 minutes, and said I should wait in the large massage room, the one at the end facing Victoria Road.

I went into that room, stripped off, and sat in a largish armchair.  There were signs on the walls proclaiming that this was a remedial massage clinic, and that clients should either keep their underpants on or cover themselves with a towel; all for show of course.  While waiting there naked, I worked up a full erection with which to greet Cici on her arrival; I was rather hoping she would turn out to be the large ugly masseuse I had had on my first visit, who had impressed me as being rather partial to the sight (and feel) of a stiff penis.

Finally, there was a knock on the door, and in walked Cici.  She was not the large ugly masseuse I was expecting, but a smaller lady with a cheerful-looking face.  Cici was not at all fazed by my standing there naked, which was a good sign, none of the false modesty and surreptitiousness that is so often encountered at Asian places.  She said the room I was in was too cold, and I should come into the smaller room at the other end which was heated.  She did not ask me to get dressed (another good sign), but took my clothes, and led me by the hand, completely naked, out of the room had past the entrance door that was wide open, past the unshaded shop window, through the tiny waiting room and into the heated massage room.  The thought that anyone who might have been passing by the entrance would have seen me naked was deliciously exciting, but it did not happen.

Once in the room I told Cici that I wanted the hour massage, and she took the $60.  I then said that I would like to have the penis massage twice, once at the beginning and a second time during the massage, and she told me that would be an extra $20.  I said that I preferred to receive the first penis massage standing, to which she readily agreed, without any of the fuss some masseuses make.  Things were looking good.  Another nice touch was that she did not massage me from the side, as so many masseuses do when giving a standing penis massage, but sat on a stool facing me, with a towel draped over her lap.  Obviously she had no qualms about me ejaculating towards her; yet another good sign, showing that she was free of any sperm phobias.

Once in position, Cici took hold of my erect penis and exclaimed delightedly "Very strong".  In my experience that seems to be a very Chinese thing, the idea that the firmness of a man's erection and the force of his ejaculation are indicators of good health.  A very vigorous massage of my penis ensured, with plenty of rubbing of my glans, and a constant refrain of "happy, happy" coming from Cici.  It did not take long for Cici's practised hand to bring me to orgasm, and I spurted into the towel across her lap.  Then I lay facedown on the table for Cici to massage me.  I asked for a soft massage, but in fact she began with a moderately strong massage of my shoulders and back, which was actually rather pleasant.  Once she got onto my buttocks and legs the massage became a lot more teasing and sensual, with her hands sliding down between my buttocks, and plenty of tickling of my scrotum and perineum.

At about the thirty-minute mark Cici got me to turn over, and she to massage my penis again. Her handjob technique was of mixed quality, varying from a vigorous jackhammer action that at times became a little uncomfortable, to a much more sensual and gentle rubbing of my sensitive glans, all the time accompanied by her refrain of "Happy happy".  This went on for about 20 minutes, until my spunk spurted onto my stomach. "Very good, very good" said Cici as she cleaned me up.  The final 10 minutes or so were taken with an enjoyable face massage.

Then it was off into the darkness of the early evening, and light rainfall, which had started while I was having my massage.  Next to the walkway leading to the massage parlour, there is a fenced-off section forming a sort of patio in front of the entrance to the residential units on the upper floors.  There were four young women sitting in that area smoking, and they gave a rather dirty look as a I walked past, but I just smiled sweetly and continued to my car.

All in all, I would give Cici top marks for her massage and her attitude.  What I most like about this place is its openness, its lack of any pretence of legitimacy (apart from the "no sexual services" signs on the walls, which are obviously there for the benenfit of nosy council inspectors).  There is none of the furtiveness that you get at many Asian places, none of the hushing, none of the "don't tell the boss-lady, we are not supposed to do this".

I will certainly be returning to Ausfeng at some stage, and I have no hesitation in recommending it to members of this forum.  I have seen negative comments on other fora, along the lines of the masseuses being too old, but from my point of view that is in fact an advantage; the older masseuses are more experienced and tend to be more open-minded, and usually give a better massage and handjob.

Age : Twenties

Size/shape : Size 10, B Cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage only + Nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments:

Ok so this is almost certainly the same girl as reviewed above, only I am fairly sure she said her name was Kelly not Katie. Apologies if I am mistaken with the name. Otherwise everything else matches, general description including the wire framed glasses and the day of the week I visited (a Sunday). When I arrived both ladies were busy and the Boss lady puts me in the waiting room with a bottle of water (nice touch) to wait for the 'younger girl' to become available.

Kelly breezes in very relaxed and friendly and puts me at ease right away. She is more of a girl next door type looks wise, but cute. I asked for a medium massage but it probably lacked a bit of strength. Her English is very good with a that kind of cute 'R' accent the northern chinese have. On turn over the usual extras were agreed but I thought I would ask about nude and I was slightly surprised it was available (hadn't read the previous review).

Anyway apologies this doesn't add a great deal apart from the fact that Kelly/Katie seems to be bit more experienced and is still relatively fresh in approach. So not too bad - although this was a bit different to the kind of massage I was expecting (the masseuses here are usually older) I had a good time. I think I will go back and see her again. Cheers.

My experience/comments : As with Maxxc I have been here a few times and seen Cici before. She does a very good massage. I visited on one of those hot days and Cici kept saying how hot it was. At one point i put my head up and saw Cici had folded her dress up so that her red underwear were fully visible. For some reason i found this exciting. The massage continued and occasionally my feet or arms would touch the soft skin of her thighs. Upon turn over Cici started to rub my cock and pulled me until i came. Overall if you want a good massage this place is worth a visit.

There is a younger girl (Kitty) who I saw in November or December. I will do a separate review.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : One hour massage, with HJ at beginning 

Value for money/recommend? : This time it was not as good as my previous visit of 27 August last, which I reviewed above.

My experience/comments : 

There is not much to report this time, since my experience was somewhat disappointing in comparison with my last visit, which had been so very good.  Because of that happy memory I was thinking for a long time of visiting this place again, and on this particular day I was in the area for a business appointment, so I dropped in once the business had been attended to.

When I entered, at about 1:00 PM, the place was empty and there was a hand-written sign on the desk saying "next appointment 1:30".  However, almost immediately a lady whom I recognised as Cici from my previous visit emerged from one of the massage rooms and hustled me in.  I said I wanted to stay for one hour, and she asked for the $60.  I undressed and stood naked waiting for her return.  When she came back she asked if I wanted a handjob, and when I replied in the affirmative, she asked me to give her $20 straightaway.  I was bit taken aback by that, since I have never before been asked to pay for the extra up front.  I wondered if she had had problems with clients absconding at the end of the massage without paying for the extra. Whatever, it just left me feeling a bit negative.  There was one other odd thing; I asked her name, although I was sure it was sure she was the Cicic I had seen last time, and she seemed to think for a while before answering "Mimi".  Had something changed with this operation, I wondered.  It was obvious that she was the only person there.

As is my wont, I asked Cici/Mimi to give me a handjob at the beginning while I remained standing.  She got to work with a fast jackhammer action which I found unpleasant, and I had to ask her to slow down and be a bit more sensual.  After some minutes she said that she was feeling hot, and slipped off her dress, remaining in her bra and panties.  As we were standing facing each other, I slipped the straps of her bra down from her shoulders to see what would happen; she did not replace them, but unzipped and removed her bra, revealing her small breasts.  Unfortunately she then sat down on a stool so I was unable to slip off her panties.

In comparison with my last visit, this time it took me a very long time to reach orgasm, and I got the impression that Cici/Mimi was becoming a bit frustrated.  After about 15 minutes or so, she stopped stroking my penis and began scratching it with her rather sharp fingernails, which surprisingly I found rather pleasant, particularly when she scratched my glans.  A few times she pushed one of her fingernails into the meatus of my penis, something which I had not experienced before and which I also found pleasant.

Finally, after about 30 minutes I ejaculated more copiously than usual, much to Cici/Mimi's delight (or was it relief?)  I now lay down on my stomach so that she could massage my back.  What ensured was an extremely hard massage of my back and legs, with such hard pressure that it was actually quite painful at times.  There was absolutely nothing sensual about it, no tackle-tickle, no sliding her hands down between my buttocks.  I was left wondering whether Cici/Mimi was punishing me for making her work so hard at the handjob.  I have to say that I was thankful when it finally came to an end.

I was in two minds about this experience.  The handjob itself was actually quite enjoyable, and I do prefer a very long drawn-out one.  But that was offset by the following back massage which was not really enjoyable at all.  Based on my previous two experiences at this place, which had been very sensual, as I described them in my previous review, I had been thinking if making it one of my go-to places, but now I think I most probably will not go back.  It could be that I was just having a bit of an off-day which prevented me from enjoying the experience as much as I could have. Alternatively; Cici/Mimi may have been having a bit of an off-day; she seemed to be the only person there (during the massage I heard a man come into the shop, and Cici/Mimi had to tell him to come back later), and she seemed rather rushed.  It could be that she is having problems with staff.

To sum up, my experience did not meet my expectations, but I would not like to dissuade other Forum members from trying this place out.

After rubbing the oil off with the hot towel Helen asked if i wanted any extra relaxation. As usual yes was the answer, she asked for $20. After the clean clean up finished with a head massage.

Was in the area and needed a good massage plus a quick release. Seen many reviews of this place and knowing that older ladies give the better massages and competent HE I decided to pop in here. Two rooms with doors, Michelle was waiting behind reception and ushered me into the first room. Second room was occupied. After sorting out the financials I lay down and received a nice medium/hard massage. Some brushes around the bum, crack and sack made sure that more was to come. Then she started a full on tickle of the tackle and reached under to run up and down my shaft. This made me lift my hips to give her even better access. Mini Mc quickly became hard and Michelle enjoyed it running her hands up and down and playing with my balls. That was bliss and I was ready to shoot my load here and then. But I wanted to enjoy this a bit longer and turned around. She then asked me if I wanted extras and I told her that obviously this is now necessary after her nice treatment of my sensible area. She then started a very slow and sensitive HJ which I enjoyed as long as possible. But of course it all ended way too early for me and I spurted a massive load all over her hands and my belly. She cleaned me up and gave me a nice head massage to finish off a very pleasant half an hour. Best way to spend some spare time. Michelle speaks good english and is a lovely lady who works here Thursday and Friday. I will try to see her again soon.

I've been here a few times recently but have only seen Cici. I was inspired by 6mac to see Michelle. Called up and made a booking. Arrived handed over the $60 for an hour, stripped off and then on to the table. Firstly the massage from Michelle was great although i would say Cici is probably better. On part 2 seems that it unfolded the same as 6mac. The tackle tickle was excellent. On turn over i said i just wanted an HJ. This was also excellent, it was also very slow and exciting. I was caressing Michelle's legs and bum, I eventually released my load. Then Michelle cleaned me up and finished with a head massage. I would recommend Michelle if you want a good massage and slow HJ.

I wen here again to see if I can score a great massage as i needed one. On entry Cici ushered me into the first room. We sorted the finances and I started to undress. She quickly came back in with the change of my $50. I wasn't completely undressed yet so did this in front of her. No issues here. I explained her my massage needs and she started to work on my areas of concern. Well done massage that was the money worth. She got my old body freshened up again. Only a few tickles of the tackle during her massage. Before turn over she started a nice tickle of my ass and balls which got me interested. I was half worked up on turn over and for the change money she offered a HJ which I took. She isn't a pretty or sexy lady but knows what she is doing. After 10 minutes of her nice HJ she got me spurting my load into a paper towel she had prepared. Nice clean up and a bottle of water finished this nice massage. Overall great value for money and will go there again when in need of a massage and maybe a HJ.

Was in the area and remembered the nice  massage+ I had with Michelle a while back. Popped in and hoped to see Michelle but she wasn't there and the mamasan allocated me KC. Good for me as I was mainly after a good massage. KC delivered just that and was on top very nice to chat to. At the end of the half hour the feathery touched started and she massaged my balls and crack for a while before turn over and a great HJ to finish off a very enjoyable session. I tipped her $20 for the HJ and will be back. Happy to see KC again but she only works there one day a week.

After my recent encounter here I wanted to see who else is working. Rocked up and got ushered into the room by the mamasan. She told me she has a new girl Annie who will be looking after me. Who am I to argue. So. I took off my cloth and Annie came in just when I was turning around. Big hug from her and some nice strokes to get my cock's attention. Didn't take a lot to wake him up and Annie straight away said that extras HJ and NHJ are available for extra $$$s. Ok, good to know me thinks. Onto the table on off for a good massage. Nice chat with Annie, her english is very good. Towards the end the feathery touches started and she bloody knew what she was doing. Great variation of ball, cock and anus massage. Turn over and it didn't take long before I came all over her hands. Excellent job and maybe I have to see her for longer and two shots next time. I tend to like this shop as you can get a really good massage and an excellent HJ here. Good value for money. I will be back.

Was in the area and wanted a nice massage and relief. As there are usual older ML working here you can get a good massage which I really needed. Walked in and Lily ushered me into the room. She is an older chinese lady and I wasn't expecting anything. We sorted the financials and I jumped onto the table for the massage. She asked if I wanted soft, medium or hard and she was surprised when I wanted a hard massage. She did a good job and with massaging my back and then the legs. During leg massage there was some TT which got me aroused. On the turn over she commented on my growing cock and asked if I wanted a HJ. Of course I said and then she turned into a little dirty devil which was a nice surprise. She definitely knows how to work a cock that's for sure. And after I told her how I liked mine to be handled she gave it to me. As I was about to cum she said "oh wait I like to watch you cum". And cum I did. Nice clean up, $20 for her nice work and I left with a smile on my face. No spring chickens here but boy you can get your balls emptied

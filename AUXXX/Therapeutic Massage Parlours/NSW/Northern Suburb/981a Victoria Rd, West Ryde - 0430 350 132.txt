After hearing 96 Parramatta Rd Homebush was relocating to West Ryde, the challenge was to find the new RnT and like an old SeaDay, I sniffed it out at 681A (upstairs beside an Asian Grocery Store) and ran into an of M.L. from #96... It is at the moment just 2 rooms with partitions and a door plus there is a 3rd room with a curtin, # 96 suffered from a lack of customers and the buildings was in poor conditions....the fare is the usual $30 + $20 and $50 + $20.............the place smells new with new clean carpet and fresh paint and plenty of room to expand...parking is not too flash out front and now 120 Blaxland Rd Top Ryde has closed, they may do OK................the SeaRay

Hi SeaRay, too bad 120 Blaxland is no more, so to have a (new) alternative in the area is a great thing. Is the address 981a or 681a Victoria Road? As you have both in your post? Let us know pls.

Person's Name : Yuki

Establishment : 981a Victoria Road West Ryde

Date of Visit : 10/09/11

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0430 350 132

Hours of Business :  Don't know

Rates : $30 half / $50 hour

Age :  30 something

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided :  Massage with a happy ending

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Thought I would give this place a try. Fairly discreet entrance despite being on busy Victoria Road. Just a glass door at street level with a massage meridian chart stuck to the inside.  Anyway to enter you go up a set of stairs. Up the top there is a large empty room not currently in use. The massage rooms are through a doorway kind of behind you and to the left. As described the rooms are partitioned off but the partitions dont go all the way to the ceiling so sound proofing is a bit of an issue.

Was greeted at the door by Yuki. Despite the Japanese sounding work name yuki is chinese from Shanghai. As this was my first visit I went for the half hour option. Yuki looks 30 something good looking and slim figure. Had that look about her that extras may be a possibility.  However today I was just after a massage and a hj. Massage and tug were ok and didn't mind a bit of touching during the tug. Yuki was friendly and willing to look after her customer. Yuki asked for $20 tip for HJ which is fairly standard.

There was a young girl I saw when I was leaving but not sure if she was doing massage or just reception. Will be back to try again, the only down side being the 3/4 partitions.

Previously visited 96 Parramatta rd occasionally, usually with good results, so popped into this shop when in the area.  Layout is a bit odd as Slarty has described with partitions not full height.  When I got to the top of the stairs I was greeted by one of the MLs I had seen at Parramatta Rd named Cindy. so it does seem to be definitely run by the same people.

Cindy is a Chinese MILF from Shanghai, probably early 40's, slim with size A tits.  I had seen her thrice before at old place and got nude +HJ for $30  on top of the standard charge- Prices here are the same 30mi/$30/45min/$40/60min/$50. With Cindy, on subsequent visits had received a little extra including CBJ, but I think these extras would only come after  2-3 visits to same lady.

Anyway, choose a 30min massage and service was just as good as previously, decent massage, very good tackle tickle allowed full touching. nipple kissing etc. She's not a great looker and YMMV but I enjoy her services, so would go back again.

Don't know what other ladies here are like, but seems good value for money RNT.

Person's Name : Sophia (I think)

Establishment : 981 Victoria Road

Date of Visit : 09/10.11

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 981 Victoria Road West Ryde

Hours of Business :  

Rates : $30/1/2 hour massage

Age : Late 20's plus?

Size/shape : Tallish/slim (not very pretty in my books)

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage/Nude body rub/HJ/plus a bit

Value for money/recommend? : Okay

My experience/comments : On my way home from 4 day conference and was looking for a quick release after struggling to find a reasonable RnT in Parramatta despite trying a few genuine massage joints and 22 Brodie on Thursday night. Thought about visiting Angie at Gladesville and/or one of the other places in this neck of the woods but decided on a quicky no fuss 1/2 was all I was up for. After a quick reccie walked up the steps at 999 but unfortunately had to wait 1/2 hour so off I went down to 981. Met by Sophia a not so attractive girl with quite a few clothes hiding her body. Onto the the bench and in she came. Quickly it became clear more was on offer but I let it develope as I was enjoying the tease to extract some more money. Finally asked if I'd like HJ for more money and of course I agreed, a bit of tackle tickle then rolled over, off came her clothes without much prompting, some mutual play including a nice kiss. My finger found its way into her wet pussy and it became difficult to differentiate between her moaning and her asking me to stop. eventually we reversed the role and my build up exploded all over. Certainly a very enjoyable experience and release considering my desire and state of mind, at the same time plenty of other options available to sample a similar product. The place definitely not ideal, can hear the conversations in each of the cubicles, I guess some exhibitionists may enjoy this? Overall rate a 6/10 for a RnT, tipped her $40, sure could have left at $20, but $70 all up good value when your not down to your last dollar....

Was shopping for some Ski gear in west ride last sunday & felt like a relaxing massage so decided to call in here greeted at the top of the stairs by a mid 20s lady & led to a room had trouble working out what she was saying as she was talking very softly & this place only has walls that are about 20cm from the ceiling & could hear a massage going on in the other room. 

Opted for a 1hr received quiet a nice massage on the back for most of the time then went to get a hot towel to wipe down with about ten minutes to go came back & wiped me down with a cold towel & then turn over again could not hear what she was saying in a whisper as by now there was another punter next door but nodded when she pointed to my groin normal hand job & again wiped down with the cold towel. 

Will not be in a hurry to go back better value around

Size/shape : taller than average chinese. ok looking

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Value for money/recommend? : no

My experience/comments : The massage was good, bit of tackle tickle, made my sore legs feel better. When I turned over and she asked if I wanted her to take off (30$) ok, couldn't resist when warmed up. Big mistake, breasts looked a bit out of shape plus stretch marks on the tummy. so i couldn't look. finished off and left. Went there a few weeks after it opened, also on saturday. There was a young girl, not sure if she was massaging and an older one. She took off her clothes and HJ for 20$ extra. She was good looking, in early 30's. sorry can't remember names.

Establishment:  981 Victoria Road, West Ryde

Name:    Julie

Age:  late 20's, possibly early 30's

Date of Visit:   21st Feb 2012

Hours: 10am to 9pm

Size:  average, a wee bit plump.

Prices:  $30/30  $40/45  $50/60min

Services: HJ + nude

Have been here a few times and seen Cindy (see my other reviews) who although being 40+ seems to know how to kick start me.  This time she was busy and I couldn't wait so settled on the other girl available, name of Julie.  The rooms here do not have ceiling high walls so everything tends to be conducted in hushed tones.

Julie gave a reasonable massage, with a bit of tackle tickle.  Turned over and she offered to strip for $30 which is what I usually pay here. Body OK with size b+ breasts, allowed onlt very limited touching, the tug was OK but somehow didn't turn me on, but I came eventually.

Would I recommend:  Not this particular girl but have had good experiences here and previously at 99 Homebush.

Passed by here the other day, and it looks as if this establishment has now closed, it was connected to the shop at 95 Edwin St North, Croydon  and some of the ML  are working there. I don't think they were ever really busy.

Mikeybee or anyone who knows Mary. I saw Mary today for the first time in Croydon today. She was very sexy but would only offer me a fully clothed HJ. Does she offer more as she gets to know you better?

The pace quickens & the tall ship is very sea sick with all the rocking & froing & spews all over the place ,while Lily is still letting me pat the Puss .She cleans me up .$20 tip & we are in reception she gets me a cold water & tells me new owner 2 mths ago & place re vamped ,looks good .She then gives me a business card & on back is a loyalty reward ,with the 1st signed off .5 massages ,6th free 1/2 hr . Head home to do report & cannot find this place ,then find MR C & B 's its 338 Forest rd down the road  .So this is a new place and this is the first report .the old joint was called Dragon massage but nothing on that either . The loyalty card is good til December so I will be heading back for further investigating and a free massage with maybe an up size.Well worth a look .I shall return. CHEERS.

Bloody well done GB1. top effort. Are all your future reviews going to be serialised? I think the Nine network could make you a deal. Squeezy the Underworld Story of a Gun and his Boat!.. standby for next weeks episode.

Fantastic. I am tempted to visit this very day.

That had happened to me in the beginning too so I found that it is safer to write the report in a word processor as can file it with a password. An added benefit is you have access to spellcheck as well and can preview, amazing what you find when you do this. No time out problems then.

I hope you realise I was being very tongue in cheek! I went through three laptops the other day thinking I had lost a posted review only to find out it was to be a newsflash release for the following day. 
Tell you what it really sends you crazy when you lose your place and your really smart piece of prose. I have lost lots of really comedic pieces of work on this site. Once they're gone not much laughing you do!!!

Anyway GB I would look forward to any serialised version of a review you do. At least most of the Au and Ag posts are worth reading. Keep grinning and wtf are you in port neway? lol.

Just a point I auto highlight every few minutes right click select copy and continue. If you lose your logon or the net connection you can always paste to a word doc rather than constantly copy and paste which takes heaps more time.

I find there are problems if you compose things away from the site on word processing software package and that is by the time you go to post the subject has sometimes moved on

I still think I like GB's serialised version better though. Start a trend.


Biggus.

That statement highlights the instant gratification world we've become.

My take is this. Do readers want informative, cohesive, readable reviews or quick 'sound bytes' - sometimes making little sense? For example, the default use of predictive text in portable devices and users who don't know how to turn it off.

I don't use a phone to write 'literature' - other than SMS. To me, it's a just a nonsense and as time goes on and we see this increasingly prevalent practice, we'll see an increasing incidence of illegible reviews. I don't care if a review is about an event three days ago as long as it's informative and comprehensible. However, if it's about 3 hours ago but I can't read it, what's the point? Just MHO.

Now this thread has been comprehensively hijacked, this topic perhaps deserves it's own thread in GD...

All good... wasn't about you or your style, just prompted by the discussion. Easy for me to say... I sit in front of a behemoth PC and a 30" monitor. Dunno how you guys post from a palm device! Just me...

Establishment : Harmony

Date of Visit : 3/8/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business : 

Rates : $60 Hr

Age : 40?

Size/shape : Size 6-8, slim, 5'0"

Nationality or Ethnicity : MLC

Services Provided :Massage, HJ, nude. 

Value for money/recommend? : Yes.

My experience/comments : After enjoying gboat1's review I thought I would give this place a go, not expecting too much, but optimistic none the less. Door answered by, to my eyes, a very attractive MILFish type, who I thought might be the mamasan but to my delight turned out to be the ML.  she had quite a classy look about her, not a pork chop at all, so the decision was easy. 1 hr, and a reasonable massage followed, plenty of good chat, her english is fine and she makes an effort to be entertaining. A little bit of tackle tickle and upon turnover time she was looking to make a little cash so nude tug was negotiated for $40 which would be worth it just to see her tidy little bod with sweet A-B cups, no sag, hardly any belly, no sign of child birth and peachy little arse. No fingering and she wasn't keen on having her nips mauled (shame), but when I blew I blew big so she must have been doing something right

Sweet, lovely little lady, would love to shag her, treat her well lads, she only works saturdays, probably won't be able to get in to see her now..........

Cheers, wanderlust.

Person's Name : Angela

Establishment : Harmony Massage

Date of Visit : 06/01/2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 318 Forest Rd, Hurstville / (02) 9586 4349

Hours of Business : ? - 7.30pm

Rates : $30 for 1/2 hour, $50 for 45 mins

Age : 30-40

Size/shape : Medium

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese (HK apparently, but didn't sound like it)

Services Provided : Body massage, no extras (?)

Value for money/recommend? : Yes (for the massage)

My experience/comments : Was curious as I couldn't find anything about this place online, so went in for a 30 min session. Rang the bell, and a MILF-ish lady (Angela) opened the door, wearing a sexy dress that showed a bit of cleavage. She asked if this was my first time here (yep). Took off my clothes except underwear and the massage began, I opted for no oil. Worth mentioning that there's a sign that said "Please do not ask for sex". Hmm. So the massage went on and her skirt/legs came really close to my hands, and she was massaging my legs without a towel covering it for a bit. Intentional? When the session was almost over, I asked for 15 more mins ($15 more) to see if anything would come out of it...no dice  She was rubbing my tummy and thighs but nothing came out of it. In the end, I got a discount card, and she said next time we can do an hour and should use oil as it's smoother for the skin or something...
A storefront with a blinky sign and a bell probably does offer extras, esp when the girl was wearing something quite revealing...I guess she wanted to make sure I wasn't a council person or something. Apparently there's another branch in Sutherland and she works there on certain days.

Hi there HolyMoly,

Having never been to this place it is hard to say extras were on offer, the signs you saw are a good start tho.
Maybe next time strip off all your clothes. When on your front can always pull your manhood facing down and visible to so the ML which may give you a better indication with her starting some teasing.
Although nerve racking you can always just ask if extras are available before or during the massage. Most places that are appear borderline legitimate extras get these questions and will likely just tell you if its straight massage only or if there is something else on offer with no harm done. (Don't do this at places where it is obviously legitimate though unless its offered to you, you may well be kicked out or worse!)

If you had answered differently to the "first time here?" question, for example, "I really enjoyed myself here a month or so ago" you may have had a very different massage.  The question they are in fact asking is "are you familiar with the massage we provide".

Date of Visit : 23/06/2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0466 677 881

Hours of Business : Can't remember, I think something like 10am - 7pm

Rates : $35/half hour, $65/one hour

Age : late 20s

Nationality or Ethnicity : Taiwanese

Services Provided : Oil massage

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, great massage

My experience/comments : After coming here earlier this year, I decided it was time for a return visit. I wanted to see Angela again so I called ahead, but the lady who answered said she's not working, hmm. Since I had known that the sign and name of the place has changed, my assumption was that they had changed ownership. So I got there, and a chatty Taiwanese girl led me to the room. Long story short, this place has apparently changed owners around 4 times, and she told me it got changed to a sexual services place at one stage (I pretended to act surprised: ORLY??), but now it's legit again. Anyway, I asked for half an hour at first, but the massage was really good (hard, firm and painful, the way it should be) so I just extended it to one hour. They had the rods on the ceiling which meant you have the choice of getting stepped on, which felt great even though you feel like you're getting crushed. Definitely a great place to visit if you want a nice, non-sexual massage.

All part of the punting process though huh? I actually don't mind the feeling when you get a bit anxious, when you don't know if they offer extras or not (preferably when you're not that horny? lol), although it can be a bit awkward afterwards when they tell you no extras are on offer.

Came here the other day because they can use your private health insurance. 

Very good massage, when face down she massaged my groin a bit and then again when I flipped over. When she was massaging my body she was putting her boobs in my face (fully clothed). They do leave the doors open somewhat. Then all finished.

Came back a week later, no groin massage at all, strictly professional.

$70 for the hour so means its $30 gap for me. Worth it, will still head back and try for extras.

Just be aware this shop has a different owner now to the owner back in 2013/2014. I believe it is more of a strictly legit massage shop now.

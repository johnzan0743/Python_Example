Hi everyone,

I noticed this place today:Home
It is opposite the adult shop near Rockdale Station.

Hours are:10am-10pm.

Unfortunatley i didnt get the chance to check it out, but looked like it could be more than a massage place, although it has "massage only" on the door.

Anyone been there?

I gave it a shot a few weeks ago, seemed completely legit, massage OK, nothing to write home about.
YMMV

Cheers, wanderlust.

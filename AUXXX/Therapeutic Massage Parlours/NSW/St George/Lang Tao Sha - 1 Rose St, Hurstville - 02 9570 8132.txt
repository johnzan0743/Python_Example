 Hailantien: One to avoid
				
Post Content: 
Guys, please avoid Hailantien, a massage parlor in Hurstville in Sydney's south. This Chinese owned massage parlor is pathetic. Apon walking in, you get the distinct impression that the management don't really want you to be there; that the place is for Chinese and Asian guys only. After opting for massage with hand-job, costing $55 I showered and was lead into a small room. The little wiesel of a manager paraded 3 girls past the door outside, in the dimly lit hallway. The first was a little older with long hair, maybe a 6. The second was short maybe late twenties, not much more than a 6. The third was younger looking, maybe mid twenties, maybe a 6 as well. I chose no. 3. The manager said she was very inexperienced and maybe I'd like to choose again. I then chose no. 2.

From the beginning it was clear she really didn't want to be there. Her attitude was so bad it was as if, once she finished the massage, she was sheduled to be taken out to the gas chambers for execution. When it was lime for me to flip over after an extremely lacklustre massage, she wouldn't not even allow me to touch her tits even through her clothes. Her hand-job was even worse and she maintained the most sour look on her face all through the ordeal. I wasn't even remotely excited so I asked her to stop five minutes early. I also told her she should be working in some other profession, and would have a  word with the boss on the way out. 

I described everything to Mr Wiesel on the way out. The look in his eyes told me wouldn't have cared if Mao Tsi Tung had walked through the door looking for a hand-job. 

If you wanna blow $55 on poor service, visit Hailantien!

Maybe a bit more information would not go astray. Who is/was Halatien? Have any reviews been done on this place in the past? Where exactly in Hurstville are we talking about? It seems that now in Hurstville there is some kind of massage shop on every corner, mainly Asian.

This place has been renovated, changed ownership and repopened as "Lang Tao Sha"

They advertise as sauna, spa massage KTV.

Dropped by as I jagged a parking spot adjacent on the way home. Strolled up the stairs and was greeted by an elder gentleman and a mid 20's dark skinned lass who had a pretty decent body on her. She was wearing a skin tight  T-shirt which had her breasts almost bursting out of.

Decided on 30 minutes for $50. Their pricing structure is different to most suburban shops. HJ is included and the higher rates and tijme frames include the sauna/spa etc.

This girl's name is Lily and is from Singapore. She works here Mondays and other times but wasnt specific. Her skin is very tanned, her face isnt pretty but not ugly, but her body....wow.

Her massage was above average, and she didnt mind brushing her legs against my hands and arms throughout.

Time for the turnover and she asked if she wanted to see her body. Damm right except for 1 problem. As this was a "spur of the moment" unresearched punt, Mr C and B's cash flow for the day wasnt to flushed. She asked for $50 but I only had $35. She thought about it and said yes but no touch here (pointing to her pussy). She unrobed and wow again! Huge aeroles and nipples that were poking hard, smooth flexible legs and an ass to die for. She loved rubbing against me, teasing me. She is obviously very proud of her body and loves showing it off.She peeled her panties back to give me a look. Unshaven but clean and puffy. She quickly put it away as she tugged on Little C and B. I got a play, lick and suck of those juicy nipples.  Naughty Mr C and B sneakily put his hand down onto her panties and began feeling her.  I pushed her boundaries a bit, pressing her panties back into her vertical slit and feeling her moisture building. I tried to slide a digit in underneath the elastic sides but she stopped that. Rubbing her a bit faster from the outside I cold tell she was enjoying it, and so was I.

Finally she got me over the line, not through lack of expertise, back more through me prolonging it so I could play a bit more. 

I get the feel more extras could be on offer but it may depend on the girl.

All up not to bad, actually better than I expected and I wouldnt mind seeing the full lineup of girls during busier shifts.

There number is 95708132....1 Rose Street Hurstville (upstairs above the seafood shop)

xxx888,

I didnt see any others when I arrived, but upon leaving I spotted another young one, with paler skin, very neat,  possibly Korean, but I only had a brief glimpse from 10 or more metres.

i used to go here when it was the halatien.  i've now moved to the gold coast and for the life of me can't find anywhere as good as this place.  a recent visit to sydney town gave me the chance to check that nothing had changed.  new name, same old halatien

this is one professional R&T joint.  showers, lockers, private rooms with locked doors and dimmed lights.

great massage and as i rolled over, she offered me full nude and plenty of touching for an extra $30.  i took this option and although there was no kissing and no penetration allowed, it was a sensual experience.  blew like i hadn't had sex in a month.  shower, spa, sauna when you're done

drop in any time, you won't be disappointed

Services Provided : massage RnT

Value for money/recommend? : ok

My experience/comments :

After a busy day at work, I decided to go for a massage, decided to give this place a punt.
I choose the 30 mins option as I have no idea, what's the quality like.

The mamasan show me the shower. took a quick shower, came out of the shower, sit on the lounge and one young chinese lady pick me up and took me to a massage room.

Her body is okay. massage is average with body walk.

Then, she asked me to turn over. Feel kinda weird to turn over naked to someone you just barely knew. lol

Then, she gave me 2 option. option1: for an extra $20, she will strip naked or option2: for an extra $50, she will get naked and do a body to body massage.

She looks okay, so decided to try option 2. She strip naked and lay beside me and start to lick my nipple while playing with my balls.

she give a very good GFE. 

Will I come back again ? yes!

Establishment : Hailantien (Hurstville, NSW)

Visit was around early April

Contact Details/Address:1 Rose Street, Hurstville, NSW 2220

Hours of Business: 10am-2am

Prices: $50 Half hour clothed with HJ

Age: Mid 30's

Size/shape: tallish slim

Nationality or Ethnicity: asian

Services: massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend?: No way  would i reccomend or go back here

My experience/comments: Walked into this dodgy joint (sticks out like a sore thumb too) one night and immediately it was an unfriendly environment.
Led into the room and a girl was sent in (the on duty it seemed) and she started the massage. I asked about her getting her kit off and she wouldnt have a bar of it. No touching allowed. Worful effort put into massage and when it came time for the big finale she basically just staired at the roof and went hell for leather on my pole as if tryin to rip it off and get it over with.
Worst experience i have ever had in a massage parlour and would definately not recommend for anyone.

Cheers,
The Sergeant

Saw Coco last night (Saturday) for 45 minute massage.

Mainland Chinese, just here 1 year, but English good enough to communicate ok.

Attractive and nice body, mid-late thirties maybe? She said 31. Luscious tits as I discovered later.

Paid $70 to house, includes happy ending.

Massage with oil was pretty good, pressure on those tight shoulders where needed.

Not much tickle though. I made conversation n flirted a bit, showing off my pathetic Chinese which she liked.

I asked if she did body to body and she said she'd take off clothes for $50. Not clear if she'd do B2B at all.

Then I asked for suck and she said ok for $70, which I agreed to. (I'm a hopeless bargainer even when I'm not thinking with my cock.)

But it turned out I only had $50 left so I begged and she relented.

The blowjob was pretty good, though with condom which was a bit disappointing. I asked her to put it all in and she did. Even happily allowed me to hold her head and push her up and down on my cock. Even pushing in to deep throat her was no problem, so I kept that up until the tingling started and I came in the condom at the back of her throat.

We were only 25 minutes in, so I expected her to return to massage for another 15 or 20 minutes, but she argued that I'd only paid $50 not $70 for the blowjob and I let it pass. No biggy.

Recommended? Yeah sure.

Not cheap, but she's a nice girl with a pretty good massage and a nice compliant blowjob.

My experience/comments : Been past this place a few times and looked legit but when there was a sign saying $40 for an hour I though what a bargain!
walked in and there are 3 massage beds, separated by heavy curtains. Asked for the thai massage special and Lin started with the towel on my back stretching me out before applying minimal oil and proceeding from there. Despite being on the railway and a busy street, it felt very isolated from where it actually was. 
There are no extras available here and not sure I would want there to be if there is only a curtain separating you from the next person!
However, when there special is on $40 for a legit thai massage and cup of tea is always good!

VFM Yes an entirely wonderful massage firm pressure no nonsense and strictly professional as Thai massage usually is.

Venue/ Facilities :- Smallish venue with 2 rooms with curtain doors and 3/4 length high Gyprock partitioned walls

It looks like a R'N'T shop from the entry but upon entering the rooms there is a small handbasin plenty of towels and handwashers but noticeably no tissues or bin in the room. All indications are that this shop is entirely legit.

VFM If you enjoy a really firm and relaxing massage without any relief then this is the place to go.

it is busy so book if you want to be accommodated.

My experience. I was punting for a reason. If you read the bottom of this site then you can figure out what is going on for yourself. I was TOFTT.
But it turns out to be more of a pleasure than a task...

Massage was thorough but purely professional. firm and relaxing. So much so i had booked for 30minutes but realised about 5 minutes in I would be requesting an extension.
Lucky I asked for one around the 20 minute mark and no problems. the girl I had was called Kit. A shy tall thai girl who was dressed in Traditional Thai gear comfortable and at ease but not talkative. suited me fine.
As the massage was drawing to a close with about 10 minutes of the hour left I indicated by pointing to my crutch. She said 'No" I don't do this. She went to walk out of the room but I said to her it was alright I was just asking. She continued with the massage. I said how about I give you $100 to do this. She said "no" I don't do! I asked "ever?" She replied "never". So that put paid to that.
Unsure if that is the same for all the girls here but as it appeared there was no indication that service is offered by any of the staff here. 
Hence the filing under this category.

Strictly (for now anyway!) Professional legit massage venue.

Mission ended I will return to enjoy this massage again by Mint or perhaps another girl.

It is Excellent VFM if you are in need of a great massage.

Cheers.

Mission to Mint Thai Riverwood,

Masseuse : Mint the owner
Length of stay 30 minutes once again extended to the hour
Cost $55
Service :- Thai Massage only NHEH
VFM Yes if you enjoy a really good massage.
Date of visit 26th Dec 2012

Visit details...

Rang ahead and booked with Mint (Mamasan) for a massage. Arrived and greeted by Mint and shown to room told to undress.
The massage was as good as the first time. There was no accidental or other touching of private parts and I thought well this is the house philosophy so it looks as if the head boy will not be disciplined today. The pressure of the massage was firm and the feeling was one of this would be a very good massage if only the Head Boy was included.
When the massage finished I asked if next time we could do this and pointed to my crutch!...
Well that was greeted by a big "NO WAY!" if girl do that i call police and she sacked....

Well I had to explain the finer points of the law to this bewildered creature explaining that there was nothing illegal about doing this style but it was entirely up to her to do or not and I accepted that she did not do this style. She went on to say Council send police to check me out....wtf??? I explained to her that could not be the case as there was no jurisdiction for the Police as Council was only dealing with civil not criminal matters here. I also stated that Council has no jurisdiction as the shop did not constitute a business that required a DA..Only two workers at a time here ..but i felt that she obviously could not understand this and retreating was my best strategy. 

Obviously a number of these places have been given misinformation as to the Law and their rights the do's and the dont's when dealing with Council.
This Misinformation means that we have less opportunity to have a punt and the amount of deliberate misinformation out there in the Asian community is mindboggling...

How do we get round this...the $64,000 dollar question...and the answer is???

In NSW this industry is legal and very little criminal activity involved in it compared with other states.

So for Mint she believes that it is not good for her heart to do this funny bizzness...I have to agree if that is the way she feels then so be it...

Still great VFM as comes straight massage.

Signaturexxx, I will have to disagree with you here. This place actually does have a DA from Hurstville Council (2011/DA-00282 you can read it here). The DA does not specifically say "no sexual services" like some DAs I have seen here Northside, but it would be implied.

I know it is crazy, but a tug and happy ending defines the place as a brothel by the strict letter of the law. This place does not have a DA to operate as a brothel. Something I wrote earlier on this subject.

Councils have certainly used their own officers or Private Investigators to "check out" places. There is some relevant earlier discussion here and a news report here, a later report from Ku-ring-gai Council here. She may not understand (or care) about the distinction between Police and Private Investigators.

Parramatta Council specifically employed a Brothel Inspector to ensure that massage places didn't provide anything sexual in nature (he was, however "caught with his pants down" as it were ...)

Again I would disagree. Rather than being misinformed, it would appear that Mint is quite well informed. A few month back, I had a chat with the owner of a Massage place who was also well aware of the potential danger to her business posed by Council Inspectors. She had been visited by them several times.

Yes, it is legal. But it is required to comply with planning regulations. These regulations mean that a place offering any "sexual service" is classified as a brothel. And getting a DA for a brothel is a minefield.

I will agree with most of what you have stated but we will have to agree to disagree regarding the DA. Yes this place has a DA. Did she need to obtain one...well no is the simple answer to that question. The area is zoned residential and commercial so no she didn't need to get a DA at the time this shop was opened. However as she did she needs to comply with the terms of the DA. As you have correctly put it there is no clause stating what is not to be done or as indeed there is no clause sating what activities are permitted. The DA only requires certain events to happen such as when the business trades and the category of activities that the business undertakes. So if there is no inserted clause then simply put she does not have to comply by not offering any sexual services...but that is a moot point as she doesn't. Strict liability means that if it is not stated it is not implied. Council has limited jurisdiction in certain cases and if they chose not to have this clause included then they have no right to impose it unless the DA expires and they draw up a new DA that requires obligations.

I realised that the issue was more of something she had decided upon her own philosophy as opposed to anything else. The discussion I had with her left her feeling good about the way she needed to explain things for those punters who rightly or otherwise push the points and boundaries. She says that it makes her heart feel bad to offer this service so she does not offer and does not allow her girls to offer this service. That is the way she should explain it to punters as the act of masturbation is in of itself not classed as a "sex for reward act " unless there is an exchange of money for this purpose.

Now for those of you who might be reading this for the first time will suddenly realise that they have committed acts of illegality at premises they have in the past frequented. Yes most are unconvicted criminals or rather would have been before the industry was decriminalised over a decade ago. However there are logical ways around this and it does not apply if there is no DA classification. Mint Thai massage did not need a DA to operate. By obtaining one she has curtailed opportunities for the business. That was her decision and it is up to her to decide what services she offers here.

Now EG as you have rightly stated but wrongly quoted out of the NSW Crimes Act 1900 a number of the offences quoted have been repealed. But as it is difficult for Lawyers both at the bar and at the board to keep up to date with changes to law as these are done by simple regulation along with parliament passing law and then being gazetted it is a long and complex process. Not to mention the Governor signing it into law along with a proclamation.
That is why it costs a fortune to obtain proper legal advice mostly which those who have English as a second language fail to do.

I think you and I should probably quit whilst we are behind...however as you rightly pointed out the Council send in PI's without any proper authority and hope that after spending ratepayers money on witch-hunts and expensive court cases in the Land and Environment court in the vain hope of imposing morals onto members of society who have their own agendas that the only correct conclusion is that the only winners are the lawyers...

I would point out here however that there is a difference between Council inspectors and private investigators. Courts regard evidence obtained by Council Inspectors as being tainted unless they produce a warrant or ID upon entering the premises. The cases are usually dismissed with costs awarded against council. Therefore no-one who is introduced to council inspectors who usually make appointments fall into any traps that may give the game away.
Evidence must be obtained legally to be valid in court. Having given evidence in court as an expert Forensic witness  the problems with council attempting to shut down houses of ill repute brothels massage parlours or call them what you like is self evident. It does not take Einstein to figure out the task is beyond most councils resources. (Part of the reason why Whalan the NSW Minister for Police at the time of decriminalisation realised the savings by closing down the Vice Squad along with the notorious 21 division after the Wood Royal Commision.)
 Close down one for failure to comply then another springs up three doors down. It is council chasing its tail. Private Investigators don't work for free and are paid sex workers for the other side. They have to prove a pattern exists before lawyers for council will act.

As for those caught with their pants down Willoughby City Council had the same trouble that Parra did. At least these gents are now getting the same services as before all the free food and sex they can handle....


Now as there are ways around the laws Planning as they are not criminal...the best example of those ways around the laws are to be seen at the well known establishment run by a very smart Chinese woman.

South Pacific Health Centre – 298 Old Canterbury Rd, Hurlstone Park - 02 9716 0153 

This place includes the tug as part of the massage and therefore complys with the letter of the law (if not the intent or spirit of) as they do not charge for the service of the tug. Now most of you that know this place as a real cheap but good place to visit should think about why is the HJ included as it is in several places in Newtowns' king street.
Answer is simple it keeps the punters coming back and complies with the law and the definitions of the law.

Ask me why I know this?...Answer is simple I advised the owner many years (well over a decade and a half) ago that the way around the law was not to charge for the hj. If there is no separation between the two parts the massage and the hj then there is no breach of any law. 

No I like EG am not a Lawyer but I have considerable training in Forensic law.

This all comes back to how business was done by smart operators back in the 70's and 80's most of which were Aussies back then.

So remember next time you ask for the not included hj in a shop that has a DA that states "No sexual" activity and you possibly will get a soft on instead of something else....
But worry not my friends everything is risky in this life and so worth the punt after all that is what it is about...

BTW EG I was as stated before merely TOFTT as the need to know was paramount but alas now no more....

I returned to sample the owners views on massage and the tug to be sure to be sure...

And for that I (and my fellow punters) thank you. But I think we will have to agree to disagree on a number of issues. But in deference to our Moderator BadAusieBoy's request, I will refrain from any further comment.

I for one did not take that as a "Pissing Comp" and actually enjoyed reading it as I found it interesting.
So as a Punter, I say Let it be.....No issues!

Thanks for sharing your thoughts Banjo, but looks like we will need to disagree on this matter.

I frequent this shop heaps. The girls do a great massage. There is one girl Tina who works Sunday and Monday and gives a great massage. gets you to nude up which the other ladies dont. She brushes the tackle heaps. I have even been at full mast and asked her for HJ, but she said she didnt. I was certain she was going to as she knew she was making me horny as hell with the massage. I wonder if repeat visits might help

Well here is a legit joint that seems to be doing very well. They have opened a third shop just up the road from the original Riverwood shop. It's around 50 Thurlow st. Goes to show you don't need to do extras to survive.

I happen to know Mint from another side of my life and she is a lovely lady. I am glad she is doing well. I have said before that I have great respect for the women who do the hard yards of legitimate massages. Haven't had the chance to see her for a year or more so I must get out to one of her shops soon.

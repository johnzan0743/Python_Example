Date of Visit :  04/10/2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :  see above

Hours of Business : 10am - 7pm

Rates : $35 half hour / $60 hour 

Age :  30s

Size/shape : Slim, small lady

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RNT

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

I was driving through Mortdale the other day and noticed this new place had opened. It's on the same side of the road as Mortdale hotel but further along and discreetly out of sight of the hotel patrons. Not a bad location. 

It is a small shop with the standard massage pictures on the shop front and frosted glass and an 'open' neon sign. At first glance it looks like more than a straight massage could be available here. Inside I was greeted by Tina, very petite chinese lady probably in her 30s wearing jeans and a sweater (unfortunately this prevented casual assessment of her chest size, but you can see Tina has a taut trim body with a nice small bottom).  This shop has two massage rooms that have closing doors but the partitions do not go all the way to the ceiling. So its one of those shops with 'partly private' rooms. Inside looks nicely fitted out and clean. Being my first time I went for the half hour massage.

Now a bit about Tina. My impression of her is she is one of those small friendly and no nonsense chinese ladies. Didn't mind having a chat during the massage which I like. Turns out the shop had just opened this week and today had been an ok day reasonably busy. The massage itself was ok, maybe lacking a bit of power but it might have been because we were talking a lot. Next time I will try the hour and see.

During the massage there was quite a bit of 'accidental' tackle tickle and then some not so accidental . On turn over Tina asked if I wanted a happy ending to which I agreed ($20 tip) and a reasonably good tug followed with some verbal encouragement. So there you go. A pleasant half hour with a cute pocket rocket. Don't know about any further extras I didn't ask, but they might be on offer. I at least got the impression asking wouldn't offend even if the answer is no.

I think this place might do all right- the location is ok and I don't think there are any other chinese rnt shops in Mortdale apart from a very legit looking place in Morts road opposite the video shop/subway. Can recommend this shop its not bad. They also have a loyalty card (every 10th visit free). Cheers.

You beat me to it Slarty, as I saw the ad in the Leader on Thursday and was going to head in there sometime over this weekend. That makes 3 new shops in the local area in the past month, with the Moorefields Road one, and a new one at Riverwood (which on face value looks quite legit) and I havent been able to TOFTT yet.

Value for money/recommend? : Not bad ???

My experience/comments : After Reading Slarty's review I had to have a look .Unfortunately it is located next door to my mate's Real Estate business so if I do go again it would only be Sunday when all else is shut .Opposite is a Thai massage Sawetdee at 42/46 Pitt St which is legit & been there since last year .Back to YY .There was a girl standing in door way talking on phone when I arrived she looked pretty good so went in with her .At  first she looked early 20's ,took half hr at $35 .Tiny room & wall's don't go to ceiling but clean with a basin in the corner .She started massage really good & firm & she told me they only opened last Sunday .There were only 2 rooms I could see with a back kitchen area.Had soft music playing & next room was busy & could here every thing ,no privacy  Massage still firm & she started on bum & legs plenty of brushing from the start & after 5 minutes full on ball rubbing .On flip I started rubbing her firm little arse , she said HJ $20 ,nude $50 .I said $30 ,she said $40 & we settled on $35 .Off came the top & bra to expose a great pair of perfect C cups ,I'm pretty sure they were real ,they felt soft & natural, she but only pulled her jeans down to her knees She had a great body except for her size & shape she had an unusual little pot belly which looked out of place compared to the rest of her .This is when I realised she was maybe early 30's  but she didn't mind being played with .Plenty of fondling & she gave a reasonable HJ . Over the line but she did complain a bit I was taking to long to cum .A good hot towel on the clean up& all done .Payed the extra's & out .Not bad but better around with more privacy .Cheers

Person's Name : Sally. Works tuesdays

Date of Visit : 1 October

Rates : $35 for 30 . $20 for hj

Age : late 30s

Size/shape : slim but not skinny

Nationality or Ethnicity : chinese

Services Provided : massage, hj

Value for money/recommend? : good enough

My experience/comments : this place is just around the corner from the main street in mordale, in the quieter part of the shops.  Plenty of parking.  Simple fit out . Clean.  A cute lady with sufficent English to communicate opened the door. 2 cubicles with 3/4 walls.  Sally joined me. Average looks. Little English. I lay down on the massage table and she gave  me a very thorough massage.  At the date I went, there were no reports on this forum so I didn't know whether more was available. So I half expected a massage only.  And it was a very good massage.  She asked me to turn over and after some massage  on the front she asked about the rnt version of "do you want fries". $20 fof the hj.  Not sure about her commercial experience in this area but she was very skilled and she watched studiously, almost reverentially: which I enjoyed

Thanks for review, but I still haven't made my move. I noticed there is another thai massage just open recently across the road. Has anyone tried? This thai massage may look legit as you can see thru the shop from outside, but I have a feeling it's just another rnt

I noticed there is now a place in penshurst called the Great Wall and it seems like the same kind of shop as YY. I saw a lady inside dressed quite interestingly. Anyone been there?

Person's Name : Nicole

Establishment : YY massage. 19 Pitt St Mortdale

Date of Visit : last week

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : An amazing massage near Hurstville - Mortdale | Health businesses & services | Health / Beauty / Well Being | Businesses / Services | Cracker

Hours of Business : see weblink

Rates : ad says $30 for 30 minutes, I was given change of $15 from $50

Age : 30 or so

Size/shape : 165cm, slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : prc

Services Provided : massage plus naked hj

Value for money/recommend? : nope, but ymmv

My experience/comments : this forum, while having its focus, also shows the diversity of interests of its members.  If you are into nondescript ladies in humdrum places then I've found the place for you.  For myself, I wouldn't return.  Nicole would not look out of place shopping in Coles.  Average face and body Sensible clothes: jeans and t shirt. Vaguely distant and bored in her  attitude.  The place is a bit small to move around.  Maybe if you are less than 150cm and skinny it would feel right. Smallish cubicle, with barely enough room to move. No chair. Massage table feels a bit  flimsy.  Massage was not too bad.  I  chilled out as she worked her way around.  She straddled me, which got me thinking about other things.  After about 15 minutes she started to caress my cock and balls with considerable expertise Things started to look up and I of course said yes to the hj question. $20 for the extra  Unfortunately the hj was not as good as the build up. I wouldn't return. Maybe the place should change name from YY to Y?Y?

Value for money/recommend? : only just. Depends on your neg skills

My experience/comments : I saw Nicole as Sieggy did above. She was finishing up, so I agreed to wait 5 mins. I was ushered into a messy back room. Wiping away the ML's jackets I squeezed onto a lounge to wait.

The punter from the cubicle next to me was quite audible, so I amused myself listening to the goings on there. There was a brief negotiation where he refused nude because he didn't have enough cash. A long oily HJ was clearly being administered, punctuated by his pleading for her to come back to his place. These advances were politely refused. Once all was completed, the ML came out, and it was the 2nd ML, not nicole. An older, probably 40+y/o super busty and quite sexy ML in a tight dress. After seeing her, I admit to being hopeful I would see her, but it was not to be and sorry guys I did not get her name.

Anyway, after the wait, I was ushered in by Nicole, and a good massage 7/10 was given. T/T was poor, and on turnover a fairly lackluster HJ was given - not for want of trying, but for lack of skill I would say. During the course, Nicole was good enough to reveal all, but it wasn't all that helpful. Overall the experience was just OK, and I would not really go out of my way to visit again.

My experience/comments :

A fairly average looking place - quite small.  Yoyo is slim with nice legs and also nice nipples 

She performs quite a good massage - with a few brushes of the hand in various places so you get the idea more is on offer.  When I responded this continued - very nice

On  turninng over  the usual was on offer but she kept her panties on (disappointing)  but allowed touching of legs and boobs - maybe more next time

After this it was time for some action, and her handjhob was quite good - not too fast but slow enough to make it last for a good end.

So if you're not into the whole story or want a sum up. Hot little number named Barbie, I'd say C cup tits, great nipples, soft smooth skin, tight pussy and arse. Dark hair, wears glasses. Pretty much anything you could ask for! So yes, had a fantastic time! Would really recommend you go there!

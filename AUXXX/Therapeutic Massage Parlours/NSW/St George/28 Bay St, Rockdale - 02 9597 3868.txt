This place has recently received a facelift and name change (was Jade Dragon or something similar). It was legit, and I am suprised to hear otherwise! The new renovation includes full opaque window adverting, a key indicator of an rnt in my book, where before they had a bamboo screen but the waiting room was visible from the street. If I am in the area again soon I may have to try it out and post a review.

this place is $50 for an hour with $20 added for a mechanical and disinterested HJ. No nudity and touching seemed inappropriate. Not much privacy either, walls are to roof but cubicle only seperated from main area by a curtain. can't remember the girls name, mid 20's Chinese student with bad acne. Massage was ok. Wouldn't rush back as plenty of other options in the area.

Person's Name : Amy

Establishment : 28 Bay St Rockdale

Date of Visit : December 2nd

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :  28 Bay St Rockdale

Hours of Business :  mon to sat 10am to 7pm

Rates : $60 + $40 for HJ

Age : 45ish

Size/shape : quite thin and tired looking actually  

Nationality or Ethnicity : chinese

Services Provided : HJ only

Value for money/recommend? : Not really, only good for  a quick HJ on the way home from the station or if you are in the burbs

Regular massage type place on Bay St in ROckdale, just behind the National Australia Bank.Typical 1 hour massage for $60, is a bit expensive compared to other places in the area, hard massage is good, inclusive of the walking on the back. Played the innocent and left my underwear on, there will be none of that and she whipped them right off, towards the end of the massage made a piss poor effort to tickle my balls and my crack and gestured the turn around, $40 is pretty excessive for HJ only, clothes on. Very mediocre HJ, no real effort in, and talking on her mobile half the time....respect to the multi tasking though.

Overall, as i said further up, id only reccomend if you are walking past, or in the area and need some quick relief....with some effort though you will find much better elsewhere.

Many choices in Rockdale (3 others that I know of but havent visited), and if they are charging $40 for a HJ then I'm sure at least 1 f the other shops can do a bit better than that.

There is one on the Princes Highway located in an arcade about the middle of the shopping centre. The arcade runs near the Commonwealth Bank.

Another is in Tramway St upstairs in the corner of The Seven Ways.

And he third one is in King Street in a group of shops that is linked to the car park above Target.

I havent been to any of these shops for a long time so cannot give you any recommendations.

This shop used to be owned and run by a Chinese MILF named Mary. She had a great rack and used to allow lotsof touching and playing with the girls whilst giving a more than adequate hj.
She sold this shop after having built up the business over a few years.

Since she sold it the shop has been run badly. Renovations do not, a massage place make!!!

Doesn't really matter how you dress it up this place is now the pits and has been for a couple of years. 

Changing ownership where the owner is also a worker mesns changing the whole dynamic of the business.

Often these events lead to the closing down of decent facilities. Not that this shop was ever decent but the owner had a great rack and a good massage technique with hj for a little extra $$$. 

Pity these things happen but best to heed the advice and stay well clear unless you have time and money to kill....

Person's Name : Sally

Establishment : Instyle massage

Date of Visit : Sunday arvo mid-march

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 28 bay st rockdale, 9597 3868

Hours of Business : 10-7pm

Rates : 30mins $35

Age : 30

Size/shape : 10, C-cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : MLC 

Services Provided : massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : yes - pretty standard RnT

My experience/comments : Wandering around on a sunday arvo and stuck my head in here. Sally got straight up and led me into a room toward the back with 3 full walls and a 3/4 wall. Was welcoming and happy to have me there.
About 20 mins in on the flip she gestured at extras, and got her hand to work its magic for $20. Didn't have any extra cash to anything extra but there was more on the cards. Don't know what though.
Got a feel of her firm ass and nice tits over her clothes before I let go.
Overall nothing special or amazing, similar service to what you get elsewhere for the price.

Person's Name: Vianna

Establishment : Instyle Massage

Date of Visit : 3/10/15

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :  28 bay street Rockdale 0424 396 186 / 02 9597 3868

Hours of Business : 10 - 9

Rates : $35 + tips

Age : late 20s

Size/shape : sz 10 with nice B cups and a 'natural' pussy

Nationality or Ethnicity :  Chinese

Services Provided : Massage + nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : So so

My experience/comments : finding myself with a bit of time on my hand I had a wander around the Rockdale area eventually walking into Instyle. 

Vianna is a friendly girl looking pretty sassy in her short skirt and even though the start to the massage was somewhat mediocre my hopes where raised as she was pressing her body into my head with my hands brushing against her thighs. I asked if there are extras and she offered a nude HJ for an extra $50 to which I agreed. The mediocre massage continued which mainly consisted of rocking my body side to side with the occasional tackle tickle. Towards the end of the rocking I was beginning to wonder if she had misunderstood my earlier acceptance of her offer when she asked me to turn over, at which point she stripped and proceeded with the HJ. She has a nice body and allowing me to touch certainly helped but I'm not sure I'll go back.

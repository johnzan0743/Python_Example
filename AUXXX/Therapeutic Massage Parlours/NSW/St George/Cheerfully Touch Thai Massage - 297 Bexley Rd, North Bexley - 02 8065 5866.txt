I called up, but didn't want to pay the $85 or so they wanted for an hour of massage.

While eating out at Albee's Kitchen in Campsie tonight, I noticed on the other side of the main strip of a recently new Thai Massage shop called 'Cheerfully Touch'. Was thinking of a TOFTT but I did a search here and identified this thread of it's Bexley North establishment. After reading the punter's reviews I knew my chances in getting extras at this joint will probably be zero. I didn't get a close up at first but drove passed it on my  way home and noticed the cubicle rooms were separated by curtains, hmm, not a good sign...
However, for those who do enjoy a legit massage only, they do have a promotional 'opening special' where you will pay only $49 for a either a Thai Remedial or a oil massage until end of Feb 14. BTW -  Address is 315 Beamish street, Campsie.

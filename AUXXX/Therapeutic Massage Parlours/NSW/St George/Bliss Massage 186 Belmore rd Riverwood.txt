 Bliss Massage 186 Belmore rd Riverwood
				
Post Content: 
New shop has opened at 186 Belmore Rd Riverwood. It is on the corner of Belmore and Cairns St a few doors down from where Kings massage used to be. Seems to be a Thai staffed shop.
Website is Bliss Massage Riverwood

Annie from 200/1 Katherine St Chatswood seems to be running this place. They have dropped the inclusive price previously at Chatswood so extras are added ontop of their massage prices now 

Haven't had a massage here but just dropped in on my way past. The walls on the front side of the rooms don't go to the ceiling. Not sure if a shower is available.

It's the Belmore road on the other side of the railroad. The corner of Cairns St as I previously mentioned.

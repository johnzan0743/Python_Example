My experience/comments :This shop has been sitting there painted up but closed the last couple of months but passing yesterday the OPEN light was on .
Went back today for a 1st visit .Upon walking in & a woman coming out from behind a massage curtain  to see me with a uniform on, it looked legit . She said can you wait 5 mins all busy .ok & she said please go thru to back & have a seat ,which was in the kitchen.

She was about 50 & round  with a uniform which was black with gold trimming .Waited 5 mins & another woman came in who was about 50 & round as well, must have been bloody twins . Another woman came from behind the next curtain with a customer & she looked the same, triplets .

No young stunners at this joint today .I was handed a brochure with a list of services & prices.

Well I'm here, may as well have a massage ,opted for 30 for $60 . in behind curtain & told to leave undies on & she came in & started a massage.She definitely could massage ,up there with the best but that was all I got. Just a good 30 min massage .

Even if there was an offer of a tug it definitely would have been a NO . 3 women working with only a curtain separation between, no walls at all.

For the same money at 651 Princes H'way last week you got a young 20 yr ,topless & tug in a private room 

Ahh well, thems the breaks .
Cheers

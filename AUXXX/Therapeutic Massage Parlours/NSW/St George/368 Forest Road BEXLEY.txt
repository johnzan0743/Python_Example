Often driving though Bexley, there is a Massage Shop at 368 Forest Road on the left hand side driving towards Hurstville which used to be a Podiatrist. Driving for OLA / BOLT 12 hours a day making fuck all and needing a good massage walked in and there was a 38 Year Chinese ML who also works at Lucy's Massage on Bondi Road gave a decent massage at $40 for 1/2 hour and $20 for the Handi. No really wanting to spend to much, decline the fully nude cloths off but did pop her Titties out for a suck. Watch the parking as it is a clearway from 3pm - 7pm and don't go out the back door as you end up in someone's back yard

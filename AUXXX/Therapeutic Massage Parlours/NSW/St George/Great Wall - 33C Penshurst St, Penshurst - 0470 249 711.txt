My experience/comments : So I have passed this one a few times and wondered. About a month ago I decided to TOFTT. Upon entry, I was turned away because they were busy. But I dropped in yesterday and it was not busy. The entrance is very public, but the door is not locked, so you aren't sitting out there like a zit on a bum waiting.

I looked down at Kitty and wondered. She has a remarkably unlined face, but I am fairly sure she is just shy of 50. if not over it by now. Anyway, I class her as a MILF type, not a GILF (is there even such a thing?), so I stayed with some trepidation.

Into the room, which is too small to swing a cat. Seriously, it could not be more than 2m wide. There is a narrow but sturdy massage table.

Anyway, I take the 30/30 option, and I read the sign on the wall as I undress, which claims an extension is $75/20mins. WTF? Who is going to fall for that? Once Kitty comes back with my change, A strange massage begins. A tiny amount of oil, which I think is good, which is diligently smeared. Then Kitty does a 20min spiderman impression, nimbly using knees and feet to give me a very firm and effective massage. All the time tut-tutting about how tight my back is.

It was around 25-30mins in as I judged, and I was thinking, hmm, maybe this place is legit. There were not brushes of anything (thank goodness because it was all knees and feet), and I amused myself with a little fantasy about a knee-job.

Then she leans down and asks, "do you want a HJ?". Usually I would have said no - because there was no TT. But this is a TOFTT, so I said yes please!

I great teasing reach around was given for a couple of minutes and on turnover oil was applied, and a fantastic, slow, unrushed, thorough HJ was administered. Kitty used 2 hands together at times, or gently massaged the sack, for a good 10min before, a slight speed increase had the desired explosive effect.

So, a good experience for me! Better than YY down the road. Worth returning another time to see if Kitty is the only one around, but I would gladly have another 30min with her.

Thank you for your review  hjchamp32.

Could this place have gone by the name of 'Penshurst 33C' in the past ( Penshurst 33C, Massage, Penshurst, Massage, normal ) ?

Good discovery and good review.

My experience/comments : 

Dropped in here again to see if anyone else is on offer, or if Kitty is consistent. Kitty seems to be the only one on, she is a really pleasant lady, with a good attitude, so I gladly took 30min with her.

As last time, Kitty took a good 3-4 minutes to rub oil on me lightly, but then began a fantastic firm massage climbing all over me with her knees. There is no pain but great pressure, and good pressing into the right soft tissue spots. Worth a visit for just the massage.

After about 20mins The question, which precedes any erotic stuff. After that, light touches and a gentle reach around for an overall good TT. on turnover, Kitty took me in hand slowly with a nice smile. I told her I am really happy that she does it slowly, and she seemed surprised. She seemed to genuinely enjoy slowly stroking up and down with both hands. I settled back for what would be a great slow HJ. I noticed she would occasionally lightly run her hand over my balls, but I wanted more. I told her to touch them more, so she did, but so gently. I said you can do it harder, and she said "its not sore?". I showed her you can take it and pull it out a little, really hold those things. She seemed a little surprised and delighted. A great 10-15min HJ was given and I came with Kitty rubbing the shaft and gently rolling the nuts. 

I looked at the clock and we were about 5-10min overtime. There was not a hint of clock watching.

Kitty wanted $25 for the HJ, which is steep, but it was a great one. I think its interesting to note that some women actually think you want your cock pumped at 100miles/hour. They also think that nuts are only for kicking. If they have the right attitude like Kitty, they can learn a lot  I feel like I may have done the next punter a favour...

Value for money/recommend? : good value (YMMV)

My experience/comments :

Dropped in here to see if things were still as before. Seems like there is only ever one lady on here, they lock the front door once you get in there. I was greeted by Linda who is short, oldish and slightly unattractive. I like a good massage and a HJ from someone who doesn't rush, so Linda looked like she could fit the bill.

Linda has a good strong massage. She asked up front about the HJ, so there was no surprises there. Offered NHJ, I politely declined.

A light tickle, then turn over for what was one of the better HJ's I have received, long and slow, lots of ball attention, no rush and good commentary. Linda has a nice way of double handed stroking while the lower hand brushes up and down the sack - its very good.

Linda only works here Wednesdays. I wouldn't go here looking for a PYT.

My experience/comments : I took a few minutes to find this place, as I couldn't see street numbers etc.   after a while I saw a sign with the  establishment's name. To save fellow punters time, it's  south west of the roundabout, on the first floor above the atm machines and below the gym.  Quiet and discrete once you locate it. On entering a lady came from the back and welcomed me. There are, I think three rooms, the one I went to was quite large. She turned the air conditioning on and put a disposable sheet on the massage table. ÃŽ gave her the cash and changed while she left the room.  A sign said to leave underpants on, so I did. But when she returned she indicated with a smile to remove them.   I lay down on the table  and she started the massage. Firm and thorough.  I asked her name, and after a long pause, she told me she was Amy.  Massage continued and it was very good. No erotic touches though. She wiped the oil off with a very warm towel. After about 20 minutes she gave me the universal  gesture/ question, I gave the universal answer, and the universal  follow up gesture/ question of nude. I asked how much, she said it was up to me, so I proposed the standard of $50, which was agreed to. Dropped her black tunic and bra. Nice body, soft smooth skin, b cups. She started the hj while I touched her ass, and removed her knickers.  Ok to touch "outside only".  Amy moved her hands and fingers around the nooks and crannies with expertise until I shot.  A very solid performance.

Value for money/recommend? : Maybe

Whilst grocery shopping in the area i noticed a sign for massage. Its on 2nd level of the shopping precinct, so look up at the glass window and you'll see the sign.

I walked in and an older lady showed herself. I did want to leave but she said its new and insisted on trying. So i paid $35 for 30 min massage.

Laid on the table and she proceeded to massage my back. Nothing to write home about.

She asked me if i want hj, i said ok for $20. Nothing to write home there either. No tickle tackle, no soft brushes/strokes, it was straight into stroking my fella up and down. Boring!

I asked who else is on and she said it was herself for the moment. Normally 2 girls and during the week there are young girls.

The place is new, clean, disposable table covers, big rooms but shame the walls don't go all the way up.

I might give it another shot but next time i'm walking if it's not sum yung chic.

Tried this place today.
Price is now $70 for 1 hr, 30min $35 and 1.5hr $105.
Prices cheaper during early mornings. They open at 8

Girls name was Jenny (or something similar)

Took the 1hr option.
Rooms are large with proper walls so you could have a conversation (or anything) with the feeling of privacy.
The girl might have been new. Lying on my stomach she got close to the tackle without touching and on turn over she again got very close to the tackle (without touching) but made me aroused.
I suggested hj but it was refused.

She cleaned me up with hot towels afterwards.

Didn't bother with a tip. Hoping later she might realise that if she does the work she might get a tip.

Still, it wasn't altogether bad so may try her again in a few weeks to see how she has progressed. :-)

I'm sorry, that seems.... Wrong. Forced. And if the girl wasn't in to it, I'd have respected that and stuck to the (very well priced) massage. No still means no...

Returned yesterday & saw Jenny again.
During the introduction she brought in a list of prices, last time I had the $70 for 1 hour option.
She remembered me, and even though her english is not the best, she was able to tell me that I should take the $105, 1.5hrs option as it would be more exciting.
Agreed to this & gave her the money.

This time the face down massage had lots of tackle tickle, and the small modesty towel was dispensed with after about 5 minutes.
After about 1 hour the tackle tickle became more intense and was feeling very good when suddenly it stopped.
She then went out to get the hot towels.
Came back in & wiped me down then asked for me to turn over.
Not being aroused she then worked near my groin area, with intermittent, then more regular, light touching and stroking.
After ensuring I was fully aroused she then started the hj with lots of eye contact and smiling.
All too quick the deed was done, but I was happy. She was right, the 1.5hr option was more exciting.
I suggested a tip but she said it wasn't necessary, so gave her $10 anyway.

I am very happy with the difference between the 1st & 2nd visit with her, so I will probably see her again to see what happend on the 3rd visit ;-)

Name: Crysta

Establishment and/or person's Name: Health club massage 

Contact Details/Address: 325 princes hwy, banksia 02 95977959.

Prices: 1 hr $70 1.5hr $105

Age: Early 20s

Size/shape: Slim 

Nationality or Ethnicity: Korean.

Date of Visit : late August 2012

Services Provided : Massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

Visited Crysta, I actually came a few days earlier an hour before closing and opted for the hour. I was asked if it was OK, if Crysta massaged me with her "friend" ? It got me thinking and said alright  . In the end the massage was nice and I don't understand a bar of Korean, but it was a reasonably good massage. Crysta in the end of the hour started massaging my inner thighs and that got me going. In the end she said that's it, and i was like WTF. She said to me no HJ and I thought well why ? I will tip you, she said you need to go for the 1.5hr option. I was trying to negotiate but she said we are closing etc. So I left pretty fumed, but as a man always is, I was curious. So I booked a few days later and went back to see Crysta minus the friend for 1.5hrs.

Crysta's massage is good, reasonably good pressure and when you need the soothing she has very soft finger tips. The massage for 1.5 hrs is good, I've been here a few times and haven't minded it. They do hot towels and wash all the oil off you. I've only once been offered to use the shower. 

Anyways after a bit over an hour, Crysta asked me to turn over. She keeps her clothes on, and sits on your legs looking at the tool. She has reasonable technique and nothing fancy but for me I found her soft finger tips nice and it got me going. Her technique consists of a bit of teasing around your balls, and fast and slow strokes. After about 10 minutes of this I blew. 

I liked the experience, but I don't think it was as enjoyable as other places at times. Sometime you just like to see them nude, this place doesn't offer nude. Well I have never been offered it and I have been here about 10 times over the years.

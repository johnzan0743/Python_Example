0415 149 301 / 8057 2958

Hours of Business : 10 - 8pm

Rates : $60 per hr $50 per 45min

Age : late 20s early 30s

Services Provided : HJ 

Value for money/recommend? : worth a look

My experience/comments : So I espied with my middle eye this place a couple of weeks ago. The papasan was still putting the finishing touches and that the place wasn't quite ready. By last week it was. 

As I entered, a short older Vietnamese lady greeted me warmly. Definitely the mamasan. She told me there were a few girls available and introduced me to Vicky.  She was also Vietnamese. 

Vicky is slim and reasonably attractive. She was very friendly and wore a short, lacy white number. She was happy to show off her fair pins. 

The decor is definitely new and tasteful for Ashfield. 

Vicky walked me into a small room and invited me to undress. Vicky returned shortly after and settled on an hour massage. 

I soon learnt that Vicky works at a city beauty parlour and does massage on Wednesdays only. 

I found Vicky's massage to be reasonable if not outstanding. The right amount of oil was used and only a hint of TT. 

It didn't take long for a HE to be offered and added she could undress for more. We settled on $40 for the lot. 

My experience was quite positive and will return. The other girls all seemed to be Vietnamese and this supplements the mainly Chinese and Thai fare on offer. 

Happy Punting!

Service Provider's Name: Kim
At: 304 Liverpool Rd, Ashfield
Date: wednesday 19th April around 5pm
Type of Service: massage, HJ, naked
Cost: $50/45, +$50 naked HJ 
Age: early 20s
Works: did not ask
Nationality: Vietnamese
Knowledge of English: ok. 
Hair Colour: black hair
Figure: very slim, but C/D-cups.

My first time here. Was greeted by Kim, who was a very pretty and slim Vietnamese girl. She is studying at TAFE.
As this was my first time, the start of the massage was very professional, although me standing there naked with a stiffy when she came in was probably giving the came away somewhat.
However, this girl has both a great body and a great personality. As she is relatively small, she had to climb onto the table a few times to work her magic on me.

I should note that, at 5pm, I was only her third client of the day. And only the first dodgey one; the first two thought this was a normal massage, so no tips or extras.
In fact, from my chat with her, it seems she works for teh same owner here (Wednesdays only) and at 179(?) Clarence in the city. She prefers the city, as they get more chance for tips/extras there. It turns out that, for my 45 minute massage, she only gets to keep $15 of the $50.
Obviously, therefore, I was willing to help her out 

No, this girl has a body to die for. She has magnificent C/D size boobs. Now I know that Viet girls are often better endowed than the Chinese, but these were a fantastic size. 
I know what you're thinking: bolt-ons. I do not think so; or if they are, they are so natural to the feel with no detectable scaring. I'm going to take a punt LOL and venture that they are real.

Anyway, lovely slow HJ technique, as I requested. A magnificent experience, and I would love to see her again. But this place is a little too close to home 

Highly recommended. She is a sweet girl, but after 6 months in this job, quite worldly. I asked her about the job; she said that, until she started there, she didn't realise that such places exist. Nonetheless, she satisfied this customer quite well.

I don't get it. I answered everything I knew, deleted the ones I don't know. Look I'm doing my best. Have provided as much info as I could for each punt for the years I've been here, and you're the only moderator who keeps bringing this up. I'm doing my best here. I see heaps of people who just launch in to a report without any up front details time after time. Sorry I'll try better

You dont get it Bob? Its really quite a simple concept.....maybe this will help.

"Please use the AXR template and not your own made up version of a template." # Episode 4

I cant make it any easier to understand than that Bob....


As usual all we here from you is your pompous half excuses/half reasons for using your own template. Among all the crap from you we are yet to hear you agree to using our template.

Why is that Bob? Im sure not only myself and the Moderation team, but also the thousands of members who do the right thing and use the template when posting a review, would really like to know why. Are you lazy? Do you think your version is better? Maybe you think that because you have been here since 2010 that it doesnt apply to you?

Please let us know Bob......

The template keeps changing every year or two. Surely if I have included all the info, and described it sensibly, it should not be such a huge issue. 
1) I cannot do the review online because crashes in the past have caused data loss before I could save.
2) So I downloaded the template about two years ago, did a review, and then just change the data each time. Then upload it.
3) The last time I downloaded a template file, this is what it contained: 
Service Provider's Name:; Session Month:; Session Year:;  Type of Service:;   Name of Agency or Parlour (if any):;   Phone Number (Please add area code):;   Link to Website or Online Ad (if any):;   Photos Authenticity:;   Advertised Hourly Rate (Pick closest):;   Location where session took place:;   Incall or Outcall (Leave blank in Victoria):;   Session Day:;   Session Time:;   Estimated Age:;   Estimated Ethnic Group:;   Nationality (Leave blank if Australian):;   Knowledge of English:;   Hair Colour:;   Hair Length:;   Eyes Colour:;   Skin Colour:;   Height:;   Body Shape:;   Estimated Body Size:;   Estimated Breast Size:;   Enhanced breasts?:;   Pubic Hair:;   Any Tattoos?:;   Any Piercings?:;   Full Sex Available:;   Kind of Experience:;   Kissing Available:;   Blowjob:;   DATY / Oral On Her:;   Overall Looks:;   Overall Personality:;   Overall Performance:;   
(that was 2012)

I have now saved the one you gave me, and will use that in future. 
I really do not understand why omitting data for which I did not collect info requires that I enter a blank field, but am happy to do that. 

I don't think I deserved your abuse. I am providing info that is useful. I will endeavour to improve. But I really do not think that the implied abuse was justified.

The template has been the same for many years. You are a senior member of Gold rank and we expect those set an example to the rest of the members, not carry on with indiosyncracies.
Other members have little trouble complying so wonder why it is only you who is at variance?

Chillax chaps.. 

DB.. That template is not ours.. 

That is PPlanets.... 

You recieved my previous personal mail a month ago.. Read it again and if you have any worries.. PM me direct.. 

There is no point you getting upset and we smashing you each time.. We don't work like that.. And i am sure you don't either and don't appreciate us pulling you up and watching over your shoulder and be nit picky every single time ypu are online.. All you need to do is just use our drop down menu or just use word DOCS and copy and paste.. 

We are not hammering you.. If you don't have the info then put in (n/a) which you should all know too well considering the industry you are in.. And if you need to fill in any info do it in the body of the review.......... 

The very reason why we hammer about the template is that those that use Tapatalk can see the info clearly and concisely.. you need to think that members use the mobile site too when they can't have access to the full blown site out of fear of the better half and prying eyes.. 

So our reasons are two fold........

Thanks AB, the experience sort of disheartened me. Haven't posted a few recent punts, might do so when I have time. It's not so much being corrected, it's just the final rude rhetorical question. I'm a bit sensitive.

Person's Name : Rose

Establishment : Ashfield Massage

Date of Visit : 29 October

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Ashfield Massage | Ashfield Asian Massage | Massage in Ashfield

0415 149 301 / 8057 2958

Hours of Business : 10 - 8pm

Rates : $60 per hr $50 per 45min

Age : 20

Size/shape : tiny, slim, A/B cups?, arse to die for 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Vietnamese

Services Provided : NHJ 

Value for money/recommend? : good


For us inner westies this place is a bit of a hidden gem. After a somewhat disappointing session with Lily from Nowra ( not sure I will review as it wasn't her fault) I decided to drop in here as I was only after a HJ. Was met by a young, pretty and very sexy ML called Rose. Asked what sort of massage I wanted, I said soft as I had just had an excellent legit Thai massage up the road and I correctly suspected Roses's massage skills would be limited.

After just a few minutes of massage I asked if I could touch her and a minute or two later she offered extras. As with most/all? of the woman here, a NHJ seems to be the limit but I have only seen a couple of girls so I can't be sure. But the good bit was she nuded up very early and I got to admire her lovely body for most of the session. She is young and inexperienced but the HJ was good and I came to shuddering climax. She was happy enough for me to kiss her breasts but didn't want me to touch the nether regions. She might loosen up with more visits. Her English skills are adequate and she is happy enough to chat. Saw another stunner in the waiting room as I left.

The place is on the main road and so quite a public entrance but at least it is down from the main shopping precinct. It is nicely furnished and the rooms are fully self-contained. I will be back when I just want a HJ from a sexy young thing. Definitely equal value to the city shops offering a similar standard of young ML. A nice change to have a Vietnamese ML rather than the standard Chines fare. Rose says there are also Japanese and Korean girls there. A bit close to home, but I will be back.

Saw Rose again today as I was still a bit they after a less than perfect FS sesssion with one of my favourite MLs this morning. Nothing much new to report. She is a lovely sweet young thing who is happy to be nude most of the session if you pay up front. Still wouldn't allow touching of the nether regions but was happy to have her lovely  breasts munched on and offered some gentle GFE. I did offer extra money for a BJ or sex but she wasn't interested.  Not often I want a HJ these days but when I do this is my place of choice in the area. Other MLs here may offer more but I haven't experienced this myself.

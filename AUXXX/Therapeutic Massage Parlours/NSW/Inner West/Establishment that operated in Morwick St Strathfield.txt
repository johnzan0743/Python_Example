 Establishment that operated in Morwick St Strathfield
				
Post Content: 
Does anyone know what happened to an asian brothel that operated in Morwick St Strathfield in the late 1990s and early part of 2000s?
There was a Korean Mamasan. I know they closed but where did they relocated to and are they operating somewhere else?

My experience/comments :

This place is a fairly straight forward RNT joint. Massage was ok, not fantastic but not bad either. ML Joanna was in her 40s and OK looking. No choice of ladies, whoever greets you at the top of the stairs is what you get.

Only $35/30mins so I didn't expect too much which is pretty much how the whole thing transpired. Massage was OK. Ball rub was certainly enjoyable but again, nothing special. Fs was on offer but given that she staid dressed so far I wasn't gonna waste too much money. I opted for hj, we didn't discuss price but she mentioned I pay extra. 

Turn over and she gave a slow hj. She staid dressed during the whole thing. I couldn't be bothered arguing, I was tired and just wanted the relief. Blew my load and paid her $20 extra. She didn't argue with that. All in all an ok massage but nothing special. Feel like I should save up a bit more and visit AH matures in Harris Pk again.

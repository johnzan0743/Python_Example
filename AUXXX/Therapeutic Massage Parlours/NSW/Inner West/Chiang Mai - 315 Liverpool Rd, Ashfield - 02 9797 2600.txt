 Chiang Mai - 315 Liverpool Rd, Ashfield - 02 9797 2600

Popped into their new Ashfield shop yesterday (others are Casula, Cabramatta, Burwood, Bankstown, Campbelltown).

Very nice clean set-up, what you'd expect from this type (non-rnt) place. But the $80/1hr oil massage from Kathy (Thai, age 40s) was outstanding - especially after my big night out. After the massage I practically floated out of there - and into 295 Liverpool for a quickie ($70/half hr).

Highly recommended if you want a great massage without any extra.

They also do varying massages (head, feet) plus the spa option looks pretty relaxing.

Interesting development - SRA's got Natasha Day Spa & Thai Massage listed as no extras (boo, hiss!) but Iseng.doang89 reports a tug for $30... maybe things have changed recently, or it could just be a bit of the old YMMV... anyone else been here recently and can shed some light on this?

I've been here twice and offered tug twice as well for $30 extra. The branch that I went to is the Casula branch.

Bro I.d89 can you provide bit more info pls, do all girls offer tug ?, Also if it need to be asked upfront or during massage. I have been to various branches of this shop, could never asked for one, as it looks very legit. Thanks for breaking the ice though !!

Are you sure about this? I dont think they do considering how very legit this place is and the type clients they have coming in?

I have been there a few times for stress relief after work when I use to work in Cabramatta and I have never asked about the odd HJ as an option as I dont they really offer it anyway

I visited the Bankstown branch earlier in the year and though I didn't receive a HJ during a 1 hour oil massage the young Thai girl (early 20's, approx 1.6m in height, poor English) whilst massaging me began grinding crotch (I was almost bursting out of my jocks!). She also allowed me to touch her breasts (a/b cup). I didn't ask for more but assume that if I had asked more would have been on the cards.

Visited the Ashfield branch (this thread) at the end of 2011. Seems legit to me. Thin curtains, health fund rebate, the response to even obvious suggestions. Very good straight massage.

This place previously known as Natasha's in Ashfield now offers HF rebate on massage. I think they charge $59 per hour. Strictly legit as far as I know. It is run by a Thai woman known as Gail who also runs a place in Burwood. I intend to try in the next week or so and do a review but my previous experiences with her other establishment were positive apart from the lack of a HJ! She says she will also have HICAPS in the next month or so which would make it very attractive.

Finally got back to this place yesterday. Unfortunately the boss is not as generous with HF rebates now. They only offer it with the $89 remedial massage (which is in fact a standard Thai massage). This means that it is not really value for money given the cheap prices some of the other legitimate Thai places offer. The massage was good but not exceptional. I think that it is totally legit but I guess you never know when you might come across a girl who needs the dollars.

Back here today for the 2nd time in 2 weeks. A new girl who was called Oil? but now calls herself something like Olivier. This place is totally legit (in my experience) but I like the set up and the 90 minute oil massages are magic. A HJ would be great but when I want a real Thai massage I come here. There is no HF rebate at the moment but Gail, the boss says she is organising to get it restored. There are cheaper and more expensive Thai places. If you want a taste of Thai land without the extras, this is a good option.

Lets say you pay 59/hur for legit massage and then tip $30 for just a tug, why do you guys even border,

Few minutes drive away in burwood you can get 1 hour legit thai massage for $49 and you can use health fun. the head down to your favourite thai B2B join like 429 or Oasis and do another half an hour.

Think about it brothers that is $109 but you got to have 1 1/2 hour and the part 2 is way more fun. Well worth that extra $20 IMO.

Massageaddict, I'd like to know where in Burwood you can get an hours massage plus HF for $49. I go to this place because you get an amazing massage. I have yet to experience the quality of this place or 201 Liverpool Rd for that matter  in any RnT. Sometimes it is OK to just get a massage from a lovely woman without thinking about extras. Not that often, grant you, but occasionally. The extra attention to little details like washing your feet, washing the oil off with a hot towel and the cup of tea at the end make it special for me but each to his own. Also I love the 1.5 hours straight also. It really lets you unwind. Finally, as I have said before, I really respect these woman who do the hard yards of straight massage and I like to support them from time to time.

Went to bass hill one, saw Leena, she a bit of a MILF had a big booty (works tuesday and thursday). She offerred tug for $30 I took it and slapped her big booty non stop. OK tug, but I got a feeling FS is on the menu.

so all up $80 for massage + $30 HJ. Not worth it, I would rather go to Dulwhich Hill.

I have been back to this place a couple of times recently. Gail has dropped the price to $59 an hour for oil or straight Thai. She has trouble keeping staff ( because it is totally legit and no tips I guess). She has the HF rebate back so it is good value if you have cover and you want a legit massage. As I have said previously, I like to give some support to these places that stick to their principles but I know not everyone will feel the same way.

Becareful of the Bass Hill formerly known Natasha Day Spa, now known as Luxana. Same place same number. They have ladyboys..if you into that OK..but I am not.

Went in, the ladyboy told me to sit down in the room..I was hoping he/she was not going to massage me..then he/she came in scrubbing my feet...I made some excuse and ran out with my socks and shoes in my hand.

Yes I came across a ladyboy in Ashfield recently but I think he/she has gone. It wasn't until a week later that I had my suspicions confirmed. I told the boss I wouldn't come back to see a ladyboy.

at the casula there's another lady boy there now i didn't realise it until i turned over during my massage and all the signs were there... also asked if i wanted a hj which i declined of course... also the massage was pretty shit.

there is another lady boy who works there named vicki gave me a massage have to say "she" does give a great massage.

a new girl is working at casula named Anne, i think she was born here speaks perfect english a great person to talk to such a change having a decent conversation with someone, highly reccommend her as she gives a great massage too and will ask for what areas to concentrate on etc.

It is probably time the moderators changed the name of this thread. The establishment at this address has been called Chiang Mai for a year now and has no connections with the other Natasha's. This place is also strictly legit much to my frustration. I have been coming here every week for 4 or 5 weeks seeing a very pretty and sexy young thing thing called Yeo. She gives a very good massage and although she doesn't mind having hands brushed against her from time to time and even grabbing her hand there is no other funny business. I love the massages and now that Gail has dropped the price to $65 an hour for oil it is very cheap with a HF rebate. A good choice if you want a good but thoroughly legit Thai massage.

Thanks MB - the name has now been updated. We are always happy to make the changes, but we do rely on punters letting us know!

Person's Name : Yeo Yeo

Establishment : Chiang Mai Massage

Date of Visit : 31 St October

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 315 Liverpool Rd, Ashfield

Hours of Business : 10.00 - 9.00pm

Rates : $59 per hour (HF rebates available through HICAPS)

Age : 23

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage only (unfortunately!)

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

I am a regular here and usually see a sweet young thing called Pui. However I decided to go back and see a young woman who I have seen in the past called Yeo Yeo. Slim and very pretty. She was very glad to see me again and I keep living in hope that a HJ might be possible but I think this is a fantasy. She is totally straight. Anyway she gives an excellent massage and with a HF rebate this place is excellent value. They also have a generous loyalty scheme.Good value for money when you want a straight massage. However, ask for the big space and not the little curtained off areas.

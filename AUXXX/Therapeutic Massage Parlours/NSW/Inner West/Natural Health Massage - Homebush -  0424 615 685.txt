My experience/comments:


Upon arriving I was greeted by Coco who is a petite attractive Asian lady wearing librarian glasses with a casual T-shirt and jeans. I was quickly ushered into one of the rooms in this shop that looks as if it was previously a residency.


I asked Coco for an hour and a strong massage, she asked be disrobed, placed the tissues in the appropriate places on the table, invited me to lie down and commenced with what was an excellent therapeutic massage. Chatting while I was lying there I discovered that she only works one day a week and spends the rest of her week in a cleaning role, I have always wondered how ladies can fill their days with low paid menial jobs and then do this which to a relatively well-paid one or two days. You would think the money would entice you to do more days of massage.


About 10 minutes before time is up she invited me to turn over and I asked her to nude up, and I'm glad I did, as she slipped out of her daywear it revealed some reasonably brief and sexy underwear and a body that any 18-year-old girl would be pleased to have. She did leave her glasses on, which I found rather sexy, and proceeded to take the current task in hand. Roving hands met no resistance and she became quite moist and excited as we proceeded to enjoy each other's company. But like all good things this came to an end too soon, I was quickly cleaned up got myself dressed got a nice pic on the cheek and sent on my way. There is little doubt I will be back here again soon.

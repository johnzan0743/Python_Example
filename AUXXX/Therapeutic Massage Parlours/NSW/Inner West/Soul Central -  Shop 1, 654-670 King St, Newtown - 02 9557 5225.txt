Value for money/recommend? Yes - For legit seeking only

my experience/comments:


I see this place advertises all the time on Gumtree and was tired of being curious, so I called ahead and asked the question "You give relaxing whole body massage?" "Yes whole body and relaxing" was the reply. I went with high hopes.

I enter to see an unattractive thai woman lead me into the cubicles which are divided by thick curtains. As she instructs me to undress she drops the bombshell "Leave under wear on" "You said whole body, I can have off?" Yes she replied, all be it slightly reluctant. From this point on I knew what to expect, so i relaxed, closed my eyes and enjoyed what was a very good legit massage. Her head massage, was pure perfection. anywayI have a feeling lost you lot have stop reading already 

There are two other thai joints on this street, I visited Ninth Massage last year and wasn't impressed with their wish-washy attitude and lady boy offering HJ hahaha. The other is Raksa. Thats my next mission (unless someone can give me a heads up prior). Sadly, Soul Central was a fail.

As LUNGOR says, if it doesn't have to be Thai, there are positive reviews of establishments on King St as you can see from,

Sadly (as I think you are aware) there are no reviews for Raksa - Shop 3/546 King Street, Newtown - 02 9519 4588 / 0412 775 055

Liechhardt, Surry Hills, North Sydney, Crows Nest, St Leonards, Artarmon, Lindfield and somewhere in Mosman(?) - or thereabouts, and probably a place or three out on the Peninsular.

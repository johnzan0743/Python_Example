A new Thai Spa called PARRA THAI SPA" is openning up above 187 Victoria Rd Drummoyne (next door to the Asian Brothel at 185b Victoria Rd) this Thursday the 10th November.the entreance will be in the rear car park (next door to the brothel) compared to the huge legit Thai Spa Victoria Rd, this place is very small and I am 100% certain from my research this will be a full on Thai B2B RnT....so the grand openning of PARRA Thai Spa is this Thursday

I have just tried the new Parra Thai Spa @ Drummoyne, YES it is pretty legit (at this stage) the set up is 6-7 massage areas all with curtins that flow with the breeze, a Tahi massage is $60 per hour. 2 of the curtined off have Massage tables as they also provide a Body Scrub & Massage at $95. You go into curtined off area, strip and the ML will soap you up and scrub you in the raw then you walk into one of the showers and wash the soapy solution off your self then you go into one of the massage areas which has the matress on the floor and get a massage...I talked to the Thai ML who was very sweet about hand Jobs and she said they will not be doing them, I sort of lead the conversation into "you are not going to survive being legit" as there is a huge legit thai spa on Victoria Rd and having their access form the car park beside an Asian Brothel and with the other Chinese RnT beside SONY, they willk fail, I still didn't get a HJ then again I didn't push it to hard.........I told her about Serenity & the Thai B2B RnTs and she asked if I liked them and I answered her with 'thats where the money is......work it out..........." anyway she did a fantastic Thai Massage

With my Thai Friend Catherine now in Canberra, I was not sure what I wanted, I was going down to Miranda as I heard LUCY has returned to Minh's stable but she was not on this wek so I went to try out PARRATHAI again in Drummoyne...yes it is still a straight (very straight at this stage) Thai Spa and I had an OIL Massage @ $80 less 15% discount being $65..........This time she asked I leave the undies on and she covered me with towels openning an arm here and a leg there which she oiled up and massaged and later wiped with a hot towel...when I turned over she placed a small towel over the top 1/2 of my Face and it was quite erotic without being sexual............over all a nice relaxing massage and with 15% off, I didn't mind it being a normal legit SPA.but give it time.......it was interesting watching 2 Chinese girls leave the Brothel next door and the blokes entering and comming out...........

Parra Thai Massage Drummoyne # 02 91813039 
After giving LISA @ #12 a good fucking this morning then having lunch at my fav THAI Restaurant, I was feeling like a good Thai Massage and wondered if this shop would be doing it hard and turned to the dark side, pulling up in the new re arranged carpark and rang their new # 91813039 and was advised an OIL MASSAGE is $68 (knowing an oil massage is done in the nude) I was up the steps in a flash, and shown in to the curtined massage cube and asked to stgrip and lie face down on the table, soon a Lady came in and placed several towls over my naked body then another older Thai MILF came in and removed the towels and covered me in oil but exposing the lower body, THEN when doing my Thighs & Rump she hit the Tackle many times, upon turning over she made no attempt to cover my shaven Love Sausage she held it and asked if I wanted a HJ but indicated she wanted another $30 - $40 but as there was a Lady Customer in the cube beside me, I could speak to loudly to ask what she was service she was offering and pulled out a $20 and she wnaked me off............now I would not think the younger Thai M.Ls would offer this but times must be tough........

Sparksy, no I didn't get her name, there were 3 Thai M.Ls working there and I had the older MILF, I think I may have just been lucky in scoring a HJ but she was whispering after the turn over $110 so they may be thinking of moving into the same Thai B2B business as Lindfield & Leichhardt etc etc...but with the curtins separating the massage cubes I think they are looking to cater for both Legit & the other ?.......I would not ring and sak about a HJ, just turn up and see what happens

SARI THAI MASSAGE & SPA 2/187a Victoria Road Drummoyne (parking and entry in Formosa Street)
The new owners who took over in January couldn't make a go of it and the shop closed down until recently another group of Thai's just opened up as SARI Thai Massage & Spa" Phone 91813039 (same number)
Their advertise special is a basic rub for $49 p/h and Aromatherapy, Deep Tissue & Hot Oil massage is $59 
Being new owners, naturally the SeaRay had to check it out and was greeted by a lovely Thai M.L. at the door and shown to a curtained cube and asked to take of clothes and lie face down then the same Lady came into the cube and placed a long towel over my naked body but when she was standing beside me chatting away I could feel another person starting to wash my feet then rub my legs whilst the 1st M.L. was still standing besides me chatting, then she left. The person and I will call it a person had very strong hands and started climbing on top[ of my back and from the heavy breathing I thought it may have been a bloke or a tranny as at this stage I hadn't seen their Face and actually I didn't want to and thoughts running through my mind who or what sex is this person as it hadn't spoken as yet and I didn't want to know so I just kept my head peering through the hole wondering...until well into the massage after a slight tackle tickle, the massager lifted my arm and brushed it against a soft belly then I knew it was a Women but still not having sighted her or neither of us speaking, I thought it may have been an older ugly Thai M.L. even when the tips of my fingers brushed against her Bra and I could feel the Underwire, so I kept my head down wondering what she would look like. After the "please turn over" I was surprised when I saw her as she was I would say in her early 20's and quite stunning.... her hands were very strong and the massage was great but sorry Boys, it is strictly legit and not even a hint of a happy ending was offered.

SARI THAI MASSAGE & SPA Drummoyne # 02 91813039 again I enjoyed a great Thai Massage today for $59 with a new younger Thai M.L. who just started working there today, still no hint of a happy ending although the massage is done in the nude (me that is)  when she was massaging my lower 1/2 and my private parts were exposed, I thought she may offer a HJ but she didn't

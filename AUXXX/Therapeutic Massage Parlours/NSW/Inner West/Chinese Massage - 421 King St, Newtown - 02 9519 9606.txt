This place is still open despite opening a sister shop a little further down the road. And this is an old review, but will save my new ones for this site only...

I got to be massaged by Lilly; she was cute, had a good mane of hair and no real massaging talent.  Her technique was limited to a few moves which she did over and over, harder and harder. Yes, I feel better for it, but was in some pain after it, and have had better. She totally ignored the arms and hands and I'm sure we finished early. She did spend a bit of time on the butt tickle (wtf?) before asking me to turn over, and the HJ was a lovely, gentle tickle and tease type, with one finger tickling that spot between sack and crack which worked! I think she had clean up some mess off the floor. 

I'm a bit shy about asking for extras, but she was worth questioning. But the vibe I got was that she wouldn't offer me any.

Ratings:
Looks: 8
Massage: 6
HJ: 8

Yes, I would still go back.

 Chinese Massage 421 King St Newtown
				
Post Content: 
I visited this site around 6 months ago.

Wasn't sure what to expect from the outside. I was lead into a typical massage room - rather small (barely enough room for the massage therapist to move around) with a massage table and not much else. 

An attractive lady by the name of Lilly entered the room and asked how long I would like. $30 for 1/2 hr or $55 for 60 mins. I opted for the 60 min service.

Was pleased to see they provide disposable massage table covers, and the towels were fresh.

Lilly was in her early 20's, and as I later found out, a nursing student. She had obvioulsy learnt well during her studies, as her massage was very professional.

After about 30 mins having my back, shoulders and legs massged, she asked me to turn over. She then stroked by old fella and asked if I would like to pay an extra $20 for hj. Another $20 and she would take her clothes off. As she was too sexy to say no to, I agreed to pay the extra $40.

Her hj skills were average, but this didn't matter as just looking at her was enough to ensure I was left satisfied.

Lily is highly recommended, as she was very friendly and could hold a good conversation. She provided the closest thing I can imagine to a GFE.

Service: 7/10
Friendliness: 9/10
Eroticness: 6/10
Cleanliness: 10/10
Value for Money: 8/10

 Cici at 421 King St Newtown
				
Post Content: 
Decided to try someone different for a massage with a happy ending today at Newtown. Ended up seeing Cici - a petite, cute Shanghainese that spoke quite good english. Gave an adequate massage and about half way through asked if I would like a handjob today? Sure - tug away I said. Flipped over and with some oil started the happy ending. She was OK for me to slip my hand up her top and I started to get a good feel for her norks under her bra. She asked if I would like to take her top off for some tips? Sure - take it off I said. Nice B cuppers with big nipples - wouldn't take off her pants though. I pulled her over for some nice tit sucking whilst she pulled the old fella. Blew off a healthy load...got a wipe down and said my goodbyes.

Not bad - but don't think she will make my regular therapist list

Value for money/recommend?: No

My experience/comments: I'm new at this. My friend recommended I go to 447 King St for a massage with happy ending. I'd walked past a few times and never realised this place was an rnt shop but my friend assured me it was. Horny as hell one afternoon I thought I'd give it a try.

Upon arrival at 447 the lady at the desk said they were full but they have a shop nearby. She led me to another massage shop a few doors down at 421. Asked for an hour at $55 and was shown to a room and asked to undress. The room was small and a little untidy. It was in a corner and had two doors. When not in use the room must lead somewhere else in the shop as while I was there somebody tried to open the door a few times. Lucky it was locked! The room had an odd mouldy smell which was offputting to say the least.

After a moment a Chinese lady rougly 30 years old came into the room and asked if I wanted hard or soft massage. I chose hard. She seemed to be in a bad mood or something because she really gave the minimum of effort. Constantly sighing and seeming generally uninterested. I asked her name and she said she muttered something like Tara or Kara. I didn't bother clarifying as she was in such a bad mood I just wanted to get out of there.

After a lackluster back massage she asked me to turn over and started massaging my legs, arms then face. No mention of happy ending and I didn't ask due to the bad vibes in the room. She finished 5 minutes early, I just wanted to get out of there so I didn't bother complaining.

I told my mate about my experience and he said he gets better service because he's a regular. I'd be interested to know if this has been other people's experience? My mate reckons a handjob is usually included and I must've gotten unlucky with a lady having a bad day. Nit sure if I'll give it another go.

Services: RnT, HJ, nude HJ

Value for money/recommend?: Yes/yes

My experience/comments: CiCi has a bubbly personality, English is also quite good. Quite attractive, a little bit of puppy fat though, but not too much in my opinion.

Massage was quite competent, 7/10 in my books. No tackle tickle during the massage. Asked if I wanted a HJ...silly question really. CiCi offered a nude HJ for $30, and $50 if I wanted to touch. Declined as I took a punt she would provide a quality HJ and therefore I wouldn't need to see her naked to get over the line. Turned out I was right.

Teased lil BAB a bit whilst I was still on my front, then asked me to turn over and she proceeded to oil me up and go to work. Would rate her HJ as a 8/10.

Only real downside was she cut my time short by 15 mins.

CiCi works Mon - Sat.

Overall rating 6/10 - deducted 1 point for cutting me short on time.

Cheers,

BAB

Establishment : Newtown Massage

Date of Visit: Nov 2010

Address: 421 King St, Newtown 

Hours of Business: 11am - 10pm

Rates: $55 per hour, add $5 for room with shower

Age: 40+

Size/shape: normal

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided: Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend?: No. But other girls might be better.

My experience/comments: Went there as a drop-in. Pretty ~30 girl at the reception brought me to a room, then disappeared. Undress and lay down on massage table. Back comes an 40+ not-so-pretty lady. Massage too soft, no much teasing. After turning around she offers a HJ, price apparently included. Technique quite good, but then I made another mistake and asked her to take off her clothes (for $20 including touching). What I saw was definitely not my taste, but somehow she finished me off nonetheless. I might return but will definitely ask who will do the massage before.

My experience/comments: 
Friendly welcome. 45 minute nude massage, hot towels, then broke out the oil and pointed to the members end and made slow jerking movements in the air to ask if I wanted a happy ending. 

General comments - I'd recomend it if you want to get a good massage and take a load off. Not much to look at and the hands are older than you'd like, but better than getting prodded for 45 mins.

Great range of girls, young and old, some just do a good full body massage, others go the full hog.
One little Chinese piece there with glasses gave me a bbbj and then swallowed.

Bugger pressed wrong button and lost all my typing.
Damned iPad.
421 King Street
Name Yoyo
Age GI(N)LF
Size: had tummy, no way was I getting her to undress.
English pretty bad
Soon as she came in,I decided I was going to take this as a legit massage, which was good. One of the best Chinese massages I've ever had, though Thai are better in general.
Yoyo, although with a nice personality, just did not turn me on, post flp over, nothing she did was going to get me aroused (just hand work), so I said just give me a head massage.

Paid her 50 for one hour, plus tipped 30 for what was, after all, a good quality massage. In spite of the tackle tickle and her attempt to get me aroused, her looks (not ugly, just well into her 40s I suspect) did not turn me on.

Chalked that one up as TOFTT.

Oh, she said she'd suck me next time. Sorry babe, Not interested.

Politely thanked her. She told me what days she was on, and I think she said she'd be at the other place (447?) but I just wasn't listening. Good massage, but zero turn on.

Over the last week or so I researched on this site getting a massage in Newtown as I knew I would have a couple of spare hours in this area.  Amusingly I thought I knew where this place was, rather than noting (as I do now) that it is 421 King Street.  On many occasions I had driven past 193 Missendon Road, which has a large sign outside saying "massage".  So I concluded this is the place according to the reviews in this thread, not bothering to note the proper address.  Well I walked in and was greeted by a middle aged Asian gentleman.  Strange I thought and I started to question whether I was in the right place.    Rather than leave and always being the curious one I opted for a 1/2 hour massage for $30.  Guessing by now I was not in the right place, when left to strip off I left my undies on.  The gentleman comes back in now wearing a white coat and looking very professional.  He then proceeded to give me probably the best "proper" massage I have ever had, firm, pushing into all the right places and I came out feeling great.  Not one thought of anything except a great massage!  I may even go back although I will definitely will try King Street next time.

My experience: This place has changed hands recently, new management has bought new blood. Almost all the girls have changed. Saw Luna few weeks ago. Short and dressed in jean and top, as if she was about to leave the shop for the day. Looks like a uni-student, well she is doing some course in uni. Massage was below average, no real skills but trying to learn on the job. Agreed to take clothes off for $ 40 (60+40), expensive for this place but I guess thats new management. Previously $60 in back room included HJ. Nice pair of breast size-B, no touching very mechanical HJ.  Anyway good looking student but expensive for service provided.

Great professional massage, turned at 25 minutes and asked about a tug, of course I said.

Started a great tugging action, felt around, no resistance, asked about nude, asked about a tip, I said $40, no problems off in a flash.

Great body, nice tits, can play with the bush, but that's as far as you can go.

Dropped a slurpee all over her hands, left a happy man.  

On Tuesdays, don't know about other days, but I will be back![/COLOR]

Establishment: 421 King St

Date of Visit : November 2012

Rates : $50 massage + $20 happy ending 

Age : late 20's

Size/shape: Curvy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage & happy ending

Value for money/recommend? : Maybe

I returned to this old haunt late last year, with my sore back. At first I was pleasantly surprised that the cost of a massage had been reduced to $50, and in came Angela for my hour massage. She looked young, pleasant, curvy and a small bust and lovely long black hair. 

The massage went quietly and she didn't have the best technique.  Too many elbows in painful spots, no attention to legs, hands or tackle tickle, but you can't expect expert massages here. Around the half hour mark she asked me to flip over and then asked if I want to pay this much for this, and this much for that... and I said I thought the happy ending was included? No, things have changed here, she said. And I could ask the manager if I didn't believe her. I didn't call her bluff, realising why it had become cheaper. I paid $20 and she started the 'real' massage and also started chatting to me... which was nice, but distracting. I'm not complaining, it just meant things took longer. I also started to realise why the massage was stop-start; she kept admiring herself in the mirror and playing with her hair. Seriously. Over and over. I complimented her, and she wanted me to say exactly what parts I liked about her... and she kept asking 'And? And?' and I ran out of things - definitely not her massage technique or modesty - before she said 'My hair? You no like my hair?'

'I'm bald. What do I know about hair?' I answered.

It was going slowly so she asked me to hurry. I asked if I could touch and she said 'Sure. You touch anywhere once you pay.' Dang... all that fondling time wasted. And only through her clothes. I grabbed her lovely butt and she got me over the line. I wondered if Angela could get off just by looking at herself. I couldn't. 

I left mildly amused, aggravated at the haggling and a little sore from the massage. But for $70, it was still decent value.

I darted into this old haunt, after the bus cleaned up the loiterers and was met by Emily at the door, and a punter on the way out (oops). 

I asked for an hour and if a happy ending was included and she said 'Alright' but I knew she didn't quite understand.

The massage was superb. If I wasn't sure of her age, I knew she was older, because the massage was so good. She went over everything at least thrice and was very meticulous. I wasn't drowned in oil and she attended to arms, legs and even inner thighs. No real tackle tickle, but she massaged some very nice spots that had the same effect.

After half an hour, I flipped over to receive a very nice, tender hand job. She didn't go at it like a jackhammer; teasing me up and taking her time. I let my hand play with her legs and bottom gently and she didn't mind... and neither did He... and soon He exploded with delight. 

She left the room and I noticed only about 40 mins had passed. Emily returned with a hot towel to clean up then started on a head massage - a thorough one. Moved down to my neck, shoulders and she just kept going. She massaged the front of my arms and legs and every finger and toe was stretched. We ended up going just past the hour. 

The downside was when she said hand jobs cost a $20 tip, but I was too happy and drowsy to argue. She deserved a tip anyway. Emily works Tuesday and Saturdays and I plan to return. My back deserves it.

My experience/comments :

I had a really good experience here earlier this year. Walked in very quiet. An attractive older woman showed me to he small cubicle. She gave me a very good remedial massage improving my back pain and also my saw muscles on what was a very hot day. She then asked whether I would like her to take her clothes off for 50 dollars which I agreed. Her body was pretty good. I got lots of breast and pussy play while she rubbed my cock to the point of eruption. I left feeling very satisfied I would go back but maybe try out other woman there

You could have shot a bullet down King St it was so quiet on Xmas eve and I thought I’d reward myself with a massage. It also meant there were limited masseurs left at 421 and I got the voluptuous Stephanie. She was nice enough, but I prefer just skin on the bones. Her technique was better suited to a half hour massage as she kept repeating the same moves and didn’t touch the arms. Or tackle. And she kept complaining about nothing being open in Xmas day. I wonder why. So i switched off and enjoyed the massage

After the flip she offered extras. The usual: HJ $20; $50 for nude with touching, which I really didn’t want. I tried to knock her down but she agreed to $30 clothed with touching. As she worked me gently, I pulled her top down and she had very pert, upright puppies which I played with. Her butt was less appealing, so back to the breasts... and boom.

To her credit, she brought back hot towels, and when I turned over I indicated my shoulder was still sore. She worked it longer than I expected her to and I almost left without tipping her. And the shoulder pain was gone by the next day. This place is pretty dependable if you’re not expecting slim goddesses dancing on your back.

A quick note about this thread (421 King St) and the 447 King St thread.

Circa 2010 they were sister establishments with the same owner. Later, they split.

Before to the split, the practise was to file reviews for both places in the one thread (quite reasonably since
as you can see from some posts, punters would call at 447 and be sent to 421 and vica versa)

After tbh (thank you) informing me that reviews for both places were in the 447 thread and that the
421 has been its own different business for some time (and to keep what's left of my tiny mind from exploding),
I have moved the 421 reviews from the 447 thread into the 421 thread.

Please post 421 reviews in the 421 thread and 447 reviews in the 447 thread (http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f59/ne...ht=447+King+St)

Person's Name : Jenny

Establishment : 421 King Street, Newtown

Date of Visit :  3 March 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :421 King St - Newtown, Sydney | Chinese Massage and Traditional Healing

Hours of Business : 10am to ?

Rates : $55 for 1 hour plus $20 for HJ

Age : 40 to 50?

Size/shape : Petite, slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : So so

My experience/comments : I used to go to this place years ago, before they spilled over in to 447. I would always get a younger attractive lady who gave a half decent massage with the usual appropriate extras. They now have a website. As far as I can tell the roster on it is rubbish. The lady I was after was not working. The person who answered the phone and who was the only person working was Jenny. Her English was almost non-existent. She was wearing short shorts and was petite so things looked promising. It was only after the massage started that I discovered she was also wearing skin-coloured stockings (on a very hot day) and they were not coming off. For about the first 10 minutes she gave the massage through a towel and I had a feeling of dread. What was the point of this? I was almost at the point of asking her to lose the towel as it was too hot, when she cast it aside and started using some oil. From then on the massage was quite reasonable. She allowed me to touch her legs while this was happening but through the stockings she had there was not much eros there. After the turnover she massaged my legs and I was beginning to wonder if there was going to be any more but then she gave the signal and signified $20 extra. The HJ was pretty ordinary also. She did offer to take off her top (presumably for more money) but I could not see the point. Couldn't really recommend this place based on my experience today. Very sad.

I ventured back here as my back was cramping up in the cold and I needed something to warm me up. A skinny lady let me in, ushered me into the first room without looking at me, stayed outside and asked ‘How long?’ I said an hour. When I turned around, there was a much younger and plumper lady who said ‘Fifty dollar please.’ Crap. The old switcheroo. I think it was Emily again. 

The following is only for massage officiando’s. If you’re expecting more, you’ll be as disappointed as I was. She started on my neck and upper shoulders and spent an inordinate amount of time on there, and I barely felt a thing. I asked to go harder and she stepped it up to lacklustre. She moved down the right side of my body, although she skipped most of my back and went straight to my ankle and then moved up my right leg. She then went into obsessive-compulsive mode on my right butt cheek. I don’t think I’ve ever had a knot in my butt cheek, so I soon asked her to work on my middle back. She soon stepped up to mediocre.
Now, I like a hard massage and don’t mind enduring some pain. But the only time I groaned was when I asked if she had a towel to cover my freezing body and there was a hot one under my legs. I’ve never had such a lopsided massage. She spent half the time on my left side as the right, as it was too tight between her ample body and the mirror. I wished I’d taken the half hour. Then she asked me to flip.

She worked my thighs and I still couldn’t get Mr floppy interested. He knew her technique was crap and wanted nothing to do with her. She asked if I wanted any extras. I declined. A few minutes later I was asked if I wanted a hand job. ‘Is that an extra?’ Yes. ‘Not today thanks’. She massaged some more 
She then gave me a head massage that was neither relaxing or soothing. More like a footy game warm-up. . ‘Do you want a hand job, naked hand job or a blow-job?’ I used to, but I couldn’t stand the thought.  Again, I declined. I just wanted to cut my losses and get out of there. She asked me to flip, did more work on my neck and shoulders (enough already!). And then she left, without a word. I looked up and asked ‘Are we done?” I guess we were before we started. I put on the warm towel, waited a while, realised my hour was up, dressed and let myself out. 

First time. And probably the last.

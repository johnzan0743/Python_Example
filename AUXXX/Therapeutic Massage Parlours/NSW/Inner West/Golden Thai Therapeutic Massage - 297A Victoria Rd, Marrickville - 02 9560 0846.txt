Person's Name : Katie
Establishment : Golden Thai Therapeutic Massage
Date of Visit : 08 Dec 11
Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 297A Victoria Road, Marrickville NSW 2204
Hours of Business :  10am-10pm
Rates : Variable massage, $30 HJ
Age : early 20s
Size/shape : small, fit
Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai
Services Provided : Massage, HJ
Value for money/recommend? : Yes if you like a good massage

My experience/comments : Okay, until recently this place was a straight legit massage place. They're right on the street; no blocked windows; plenty of signs specifying no sex, no HJ, no body slide, no nothing. I'd been here several times and gotten straight massages, price about $100 but some of the best I've ever had; they even made you keep your undies on.

Well, times have changed. Maybe it's the new places around the corner. But when I went in today, expecting a straight massage, and saw Katie, I got a lot more. Oil massage had now dropped to $80, to start.

The place isn't special. The rooms are small, dim, neat enough, not dirty but not spotless. They still leave the sliding doors open a bit. I think they still do straight massage if that's all you want: they have those cotton trousers for the non-oil massage, and they have rates for Thai massage, oil massage, 30 min and hour.

But Katie didn't tell me to keep my undies on, so I didn't. I lay down naked, and draped a towel over my ass. She kept that on while she did the first pressure round on me, then it quickly got whipped away. She then proceeded to give me a proper, hard, elbows-in, Thai massage with plenty of oil. Really loosened me up.

When she got down to the legs, though, her hands went right up into the crack between leg and ass. She never slid her fingers right up over my ass, but she came damn close. She definitely slid her fingers in between my leg and my ball sack. Over and over, with lots of oil. She was not scared. There was never any explicit ball tickle, just lots of close crevice rubbing, which was hot.

She asked me to turn over, gave me a proper head pillow, draped a small towel over my eyes - just like a straight massage - but didn't cover my cock. She continued rubbing oil on my legs, and again was right up into the crevices. This time she was sliding her fingers right in between my cock and balls and leg; still ostensibly a leg massage, but with no worries about what she was brushing against.

This made me rock hard. I was quickly erect. It was about 45 minutes into my massage.

Then she said, "You want help?"

I said yes.

She said "Thirty dollars."

I said yes.

She oiled up, and got right onto my balls and dick. She stroked, squeezed, and did an expert move of brushing her hand over my cock while pushing it on my belly.

I reached out to touch her, and was able to touch leg through her cotton tights, but she kept her distance.

She got me in her hand properly and stroked me like a champ. I came like a fucking geyser.

She cleaned me up, but I had no run and couldn't dawdle. She had been quiet throughout but was very friendly after when I asked her name. Katie works every day except Monday and Wednesday.

She didn't shy away from saying that I owed her $110, despite some other guy - who, from the sounds I heard in the next room, got a straight massage, and was now drinking tea - sitting there.

I can't say for sure that this whole place has changed, and now has cheaper massage plus optional HJ if you want it. I only know that Katie was definitely up for it today, and made me spray like an 18-year-old.

Went back yesterday and it seems to have reverted to a straight massage-only place. Both I and another person I heard came in after me were taken to our massage rooms, but they left the sliding doors partway open to the hall, almost as a sign that no extras are on offer. And certainly, for me, none were. I could even hear the girl with the guy next door instruct him to leave his undies on before the massage, a sure sign of a legit joint.

And now this place seems to have changed back to RnT.

Person's Name : Nana
Establishment : It's changed now. Something like Best Thai Massage?
Date of Visit : 30 Sep 13
Rates : $80 Thai oil massage, $20 HJ
Age : early 20s
Size/shape : small, plump
Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai
Services Provided : Massage, HJ
Value for money/recommend? : Yes if you like a good massage

My experience/comments : Nana asked me if I'd been here before. I said yes, but the last several times it's been just straight massage. But today Nana made it clear early on that extras were on the menu.

Her massage technique was pretty good, and worked out some knots. But during the initial back part of it her hand made a few swoops right down my butt crack, over my asshole, and to my balls. She did this a few times, once every few minutes, perhaps as a way of telling whether I was interested in legit massage only.

I was not, and responded with a lifted ass to give her better access. She took the opportunity to slide her oily fingers right down my ass crack, rubbing over my hole and down to my nuts, as she massaged my back and legs. She was fully clothed the whole time.

On the turnover she positioned herself sat on the side of the bed, laid my left arm on her thigh, and used her hands to lube up my belly, chest, nipples, and then started working my cock and balls. She went slow, taking her time, which was very good. She did not undress, nor did she go into fake sexy mode. She's more the cute, slightly chubby, girl-next-door type, if that's what you like. The juxtaposition of her quiet sweetness and her expertly slow hand technique got me fired up. She was happy to let me rub her legs and tits, though only over her clothes.

She brought me to a squirting climax right on time, cleaned me up, and sent me out with a smile. 

Value if you want a proper massage first, and if you like the plump sweet naughty young ones, not the slutty ones.

Yep, the name has definitely changed to "Best Thai Massage", same address.

However the RnT on offer is not universally available. I stopped in this afternoon (02-Oct-13) for a 30-minute session, got a 19-year-old-ish skinny girl who gave a very average massage with no tug on offer at all, despite my flagrant crotch offer. Maybe there would have been if I'd asked sooner, but I don't think so. It seemed like a completely straight massage from the start. So YMMV.

Person's Name : Nisi

Establishment : Golden Thai Therapeutic Massage Marrickville

Date of Visit : 11/12/2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 297a Victoria Rd Marrickville (on the corener with the laneway)

Hours of Business : 10-9ish/10ish depending on how busy they are.

Rates : $50/hr, $20 HJ clothed

Age : mid to late 20's

Size/shape : 10, a bit chubby, hard to tell under her clothes

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Thai massage with HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes if you are after a good massage, no for the HJ

My experience/comments : Anew masage place had opened up on the lower part of Marrickville Rd offering 60mins for $45. Went in and had a look and ask some questions. When asked if they offered "special massage" they appeared confused, then realised and say no, only straight massage. Fair enough as they had a proper uniform but always worth asking. Went around the corner to check out an older place that I had not been to. Nisi unlocked the door, asked about rates and chose the hour. Before handing over the money I asked about "special massage" again and she appeared confused - great.... no uniforms here and decided to use my hand to demonstrate, she shyly said yes and directed me to a small room with a low large table. Each room goes to the ceiling, has its own stereo with an eclectic mix of pop and traditional relaxation stuff.

The massage was with minimal cream and in true Thai style, was really good. I was draped in a towel but I was frequently exposed. After promoting my groin a few times I gave up and just let the massage continue. Flipped over and again, I was exposed with a growing hard-on and she just continued with the massage with the faintest tease which wasn't enticing but more annoying. Toward the end she offered HJ for $20 and quickly agreed. She declined getting even her top off or letting me touch her (with an increased tip of course) which certainly would have helped me. She got out the oil and had a pretty poor technique, soft-medium straight up and down rub with no deviation. It took her 10-15 mins worht of this to get me over and only when I clenched up and shot one high into the sky. Had a little more massage to finish.
Taken back to the front door and instead of getting kicked out I was offered some tea which was a really nice touch.

I would recommend for a good straight massage but wouldn't be going for the HJ. Then again are you better off getting a TRULY PROPER massage, claiming a rebate on private health insurance then going up the road somewhere for a quick tug even.

Just a heads up on this place - it has moved (replaced by a mattress store which is surprising considering how narrow the shop is)
Now at 131 Marrickville Rd near Billy's. I have walked in here before and got told they don't do HJ's but this was before this place moved in there.

I plan to explore soon and report back but for now it is a great unknown.

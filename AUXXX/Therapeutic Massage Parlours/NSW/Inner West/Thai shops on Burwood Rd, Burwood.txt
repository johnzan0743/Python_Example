 Thai shops on Burwood Rd, Burwood
				
Post Content: 
Sorry but this is not a review. Rather an appeal for intel. Has anyone been to any of the plethora of new Thai shops along Burwood Rd?  I am particulaly interested in the place upstairs opposite the NAB near Westfield and the other shop just up the road past the church. I know there are also 2 or 3 others up the other end of Burwood past the station. I will take one for the team soon but interested if any of you local boys have done this already. Yours in anticipation. MB

Haven't sampled the two you describe, but have tried all three of the shops along Burwood Rd to the South of the station and there's been no hint of extras whatsoever. Only one I know is a sure thing in/near the main shopping strip is Sensai Thai on Railway Pde (a bit beyond Oliver Brown), however if you value your privacy this shop ain't good as there ain't nothin' but curtains. My personal recommendation involves going a little further up Burwood Rd to one of Lungor's favourite haunts Concord Massage (just over Parramatta Rd)

In case anyone is wondering, the shop opposite Westfields appears totally legit. I have been twice now. Lovely set up with a couple of fully enclosed rooms and other more standard curtained spaces.The massages were both fantastic. Very professional and quite sensual in that teasing way of some Thai woman. Health fund rebates available. Happy to provide details if anyone wants them.

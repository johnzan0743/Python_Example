This place is a rub only Thai massage in Norton St, next door to the Plaza.

Last year they moved to new premises on the street, which are very nicely decorated, clean and spacious. It's $65/hour with a loyalty card giving a free massage every so often.

The masseurs vary, but mostly they are very good, and all are properly trained. The best are really really good.

This place is very popular, especially on weekends. Ring 9569 7981 to book.

I've been going there on and off for several years and never had anything other than a rub. There might be the occasional bit of "accidental" brushing against the groin, but that's about it. There are hanging sheets separating massage areas, so no real privacy there. Out the back are a couple of rooms with more privacy.

Massage rates $50 for the hour $30 for 30 mins, extras at various prices at the ladies discretion.
No shower available, so shower before showing up!

Not 1, not 2, but 3 reviews at once, how's that for value for money?

To look at, this is a regular ol legit Chinese massage joint, it has the Chinese acupressure posters, music, scent and candles that they all do.

I was put onto this place by a good friend, someone hopefully who will be joining us soon and reviewing in his own particular way. That is the beauty of these forums, there is no other way you will find this kind of advice, and could waste a lot of time, energy and money getting bad experiences, prob even bad massages too!

Now I had a tip off, ask for Jo-Jo my friend told me, he also told me some of what I could expect, so the phone call was duly made, Jo-Jo is popular so bookings are essential.
Jo-Jo is mid to late 20's. full figured with d cup breasts, perhaps a size 10 or so, long hair and a lovely smile; overall a fairly cute package.
The massage was pretty good, I understand that back walking is available too, but not my cup of tea. After I rolled over it was straight into GFE time, absolutely delightful, long slow deep kisses, as if we had know each other for years, followed by sex, GFE style again.
One hour massage, $50, sex and extra $50, an absolute bargain.

Review No 2
Back again the following week, turned up 40 mins early for a repeat session with Jo-Jo, so booked a 30 min session with Mary.
Mary is early 20s, Chinese, very slim, a-cups, cute face with a nice attitude. Massage was pretty good, she only offered a nude tug for an extra $30, with some touching included.
Session with Jo-Jo similar to last time, bliss!

Review No 3
Sa-Sa
Now, you are not going to believe this, but Jo-Jo and Sa-Sa are sisters! I have to admit I didn't ask to see their birth certificates, (prob not much use since they would be in Chinese) but the family resemblance is striking, same bone structure, same body style. Sa-Sa is a few years younger than Jo-Jo, a few Kgs less, and some might say a bit prettier. The service I got was very similar to that with Jo-Jo, a fun session, though I clicked more with Jo-Jo, this time the price was $70 extra.
Sex  with both was with a condom, BBBJ was indulged in, and very nice it was too, both sisters were a little on the hairy side for me so no DATY, though my friend implied that was available too. Both were good kissers, with DFK on the menu.
There is a strong rumor that they will do some kind of a double session together, so if that is on your bucket list, start saving and make those bookings.

As with all these places, what is offered to one customer is not always what is on offer to another, so just cos I got one service, doesn't mean that you will. It's their choice and often why they work in a massage joint rather than a full service joint  they get to choose who gets what, and at what price.

The bad news, Jo-Jo and Sa-Sa are away till the end of Feb.

am not sure if this should be in the south or inner west section, any ideas guys?

Hi All,

Newtown Massage Therapy Centre
Shop 3/501 King Street, Newtown
Phone: 95571830

"All roads lead to Newtown", to coin a phrase.

Lately my batting average in punting hasn't been too good. In other words, I feel like I've taken up permanent residency in Dudsville, NSW.

Look, it's called punting because it's all a gamble. That's why I get somewhat bemused when punters complain after a crook punt. I try to see the funny side of a lousy punt, or learn something from it.

Let me give you an example. I went to an RnT place where the mamasan threw me into the arms of a sweet young hottie from Korea. She led to the room where I undressed and lay on the massage table. Soon the massage began and her massage technique was no technique at all. So, I figure this shouldn't all be a total loss and I negotiated full service with her for an additional $50. I rolled over and yep, you guessed it, they had given me the old switcheroo. Standing next to the table was a lady who looked more like the young hotties granny. She smiled and it looked like the last time she'd gone to the dentist was shortly after birth circa. 1927. I mean there were more holes in that gob than graves in Rookwood Cemetery. I just went with the flow, got little Jack over the line and split.

What did I learn? Well, now I take a snap of the hottie with my mobile phone and match it with her appearance in the room before the massage begins. If possible I attempt to get fingerprints as well. On some occasions I have tried to get mamasan to sign a statutory declaration certifying the lady in front of me was they lady I would get, but this was met with mixed results. (See, there is both learning and humour in a rotten punt!)

This was not a rotten punt.

I have a history with this establishment that extends back a couple of years to the time the boss Davie had a joint on Deane Street in Burwood. The new digs are cleaner and most pleasant than the old dive. After they moved to Newtown I experienced a decline for me in service.

So, it was not without some trepidation that I returned and saw a lovely lady named Jo-Jo. Jo-Jo is a mid to late twenties Hong Kong lass, with C-cup breast, brown hair that suits her and a sensuous mouth. She is not petite, but she is weight for height so I found her very attractive.
Into the room we went and she disappeared while I undressed. Upon her return I compared the snap I took of her in reception and yes they were the same. So far, so good, as they say.

She began with a back walk. After a few moments I heard what I thought was the sound of somebody frying bacon in the kitchen only to discover it was the cracking sound of my spine as she marched across it. Don't get me wrong, she knew what she was doing. But still my mind drifted into thoughts about wheelchairs and what quadriplegia might mean for me on a personal level. When she stood on my neck visions of me existing only as a talking head become worrying, but, as they say, it was all good.

Now I will take the K-Rudd approach to being interviewed and interview myself.

Was it a good massage? Absolutely.

Did you seek out extras? I sure did.

Were they available? They were.

Were you intimate with her? Depends on how you define intimate.

Yes, I will go back and yes I plan to see her again fro a very specific reason that I will share with you at a later date.

Back with ya later

Hi All,

Well today I was wandering around aimlessly as has become my usual modis operandi and found myself in front of this establishment. I could tell it was destiny and the business card I picked up here last time I punted that had converged to bring me here. 

I said to myself “Self, can you really afford this?” I opened my sad, battered wallet and asked another question. “Self can you afford not to go here?” The answer to the first question was ‘No’ and the answer to the second was also ‘No’.  Guess which one was the most powerful?

I came. I saw. I entered.

Upon entering I was greeted by the lovely Miko who treated me like I was her long lost husband. She ought to because I think I keep this joint in the chips and Miko in the workforce. 

She told me only Mary was available. I had read on another forum that Mary gave a terrible massage, but a punt is a punt.

I was given the front room next to reception. I hate that room because you hear the phone going non-stop and Miko saying the same things over and over like “Today we have Ricci, Na-Na, Patty and Mary all lovely ladies and give you good massage!”

Little Mary is very easy on the eye. She says she is 22 and I believe her. She has a very pretty face, soft voice with ok English, c-cup breasts and I could not see even the most minute flaw on her body 

(Let me digress for just a moment so you’ll know the lay of the land here. I’ve been doing a lot of punting lately and am pretty much all fucked out so I wasn’t really into seeking full service and wasn’t bothered if I didn’t even get a handjob.)

Now back to the review. Her massage wasn’t really bad. With her fingers she ironed out some kinks in my back muscles, massaged everywhere including the hands and did a fairly decent leg massage.

A strange thing happened in the middle of the massage. The following conversation ensued:

Mary: Jack do you mind if I get something to eat I am hungry.
Jack: (Nonplussed) Ah, no I guess not.
Mary: Thanks. (She leaves the room for about 2 minutes and returns to continue the massage.)

What on earth was that? In those two minutes did she eat a 3 course meal and have the cheese board and mints as well? Strange, but then again I always thought it was strange that Snow White lived in the middle of nowhere with 7 asexual dwarfs. Not a pretty picture folks.

At rollover time I negotiated her stripping off and a tit suck while she rubbed and tugged on little Jack. It was a fine experience.

Afterwards she got some warm towels and cleaned me up and then I was out on the street again as aimless as before.

This saga is due to be continued when my wallet gets a bit fatter and after living on dog biscuits and generic baked beans for awhile.

Jack.

Howdy Everyone,

I need to write this review fairly quickly or it will have as much clarity in my memory as the shower I took on November 14, 2004. That’s how memorable this punt was. It’s not like it was bad, but just totally forgettable like a McDonald’s Big Mac.

What is memorable about it is that it contains two elements on my top 10 list of personal dislikes. (Note particularly the last two.)

I dislike people who feel they are entitled to cut in front of me in a queue.

I dislike the ‘undeserving poor’ who feel the state i.e. taxpayer owes them a living.

I dislike the ‘undeserving rich’ i.e. politicians of all persuasions who have their ample snouts in the public trough.

I dislike those call centres that always call me at dinner time and want to talk to ‘Mr. Jack’.

I dislike the tellers at the Commonwealth Bank who always call me ‘John’.

I dislike TV commercials of all types.

I dislike rap and heavy metal.

I dislike any film that Nicole Kidman has appeared in and any Keith Urban tune.

I dislike the fact I always buy ‘extras’ when punting even though I know I’ll regret it later.

I dislike ML’s or WL’s who produce moans that they and I know are fake.

I always bring extra money with me when I punt. I know it’s to purchase ‘extras’, but I deny that to myself. I tell myself I need it in case something unexpected happens to me. Like maybe a bus hits me and I have to pay for a cab that takes me to the nearest emergency room when I die two hours later not having been seen by anyone.

Who am I kidding? I have to have those ‘extras’ even if I don’t really want them and they are no good.

I hate fake moaning. You know, it’s not very flattering to lay there and hear those fake moans and realise that she thinks I am so stupid and my ego so in need of stroking that I’ll buy that it’s real for even a nano second. (On second thought maybe we punters are a dumb lot. I’ve read many a review where a punter had claimed “She moaned and came two times in the session!” And I think. “Yeah and I am Casanova and all the WL’s will pay me for my services!” I then look in the mirror to see that I am more an aged Joe College with a touch of arthritis.)

Well, the lady of the day was Mina. She said she was 29, but I’d guess more 35. She was chubby without h being fat and had had a bub. I think she had a pretty face with thick sensuous lips. She had an ok attitude,

I should have settled for the rub and tug and the rub seemed to be going ok. Could I settle for that? No, I had to have extras so full service it was. She took off her clothes and she is one of those ladies who looks better with them on.  Everything sort of fell out when the clothing supports departed.

Before any real foreplay began the moaning started, the pseudo-passion began to rise until a fake orgasm what achieved. This was followed by phoney elation on her part and the introduction of a lie e.g. “You so good you make me cum”. It would have been more convincing if it had occurred after I’d changed the flat tyre on her car.

Anyway, it wasn’t really bad. Yes, I had an orgasm. She is a nice lady and I suppose in her own way she thought she was making me happy.

I resented myself for having paid for those ‘extras’. A tug would have served its purpose and I would have had enough money to afford walking in front of a bus.

Will I go back? Yes.

Will I see Mina again? Nope there are many others who can provide pseudo moans to hear and fake orgasms to observe.

See you later.

Jack

Hi All,

Let’s talk.

If I had an eternity I would list all my foibles and aspects of myself that render me an imperfect person. Nonetheless, I’ll simply cut to the chase and point out that when I have a few quid in my jeans I blow it by living high on the hog. (Note: Being Jewish I need apologise to my fellow Jews for using the non-kosher term ‘hog’. It was meant in the descriptive not the gastronomic sense.)

Where was I? Oh, I remember, blowing money. So, I decided I’d have a very expensive feed in the food hall above Paddy’s Market in Chinatown. Meals comprising doner kebabs cost me the proverbial arm and leg. How’s that? you ask. Let me explain. When I buy a beef doner kebab and return to my table I have to prepare it so it’s fit to eat. First I have to remove the beef. I am Jewish, but also a practising Buddhist and cannot eat dead animals. (I have no idea when I will stop being a ‘practising Buddhist’ and become the real McCoy.) Second, I have to remove the tomatoes as I get headaches from msg and they are in tomatoes. Third, I have to remove the lettuce as lettuce tends to give me the runs. Finally, I have to remove the cheese as I am lactose intolerant. The result is I am left with e wrapper and folks when you’re hungry you can go through a lot of wrappers and at $10 a pop it runs into serious cash.

Anyway, $60 lighter and a number of wrappers later I was looking at the Daily Telegraph and speculating where I might punt. I called 12 Bellevue St and as Lisa was not there I could not face that dingy hell hole today. I then thought of Billy’s, but even I shivered at the thought of negotiating the piss smell stairs, the ashtrays full of timeless cigarette butts and the notorious Mr. Billy who on his best day is a barely tolerated shit.

So, I decided that I would go to 501 King Street, Newtown. This is a clean, well kept establishment with a low price. Most of the ladies here are early to mid-20’s and all are quite attractive.

Today there were four ladies on. Mary, Wendy, Thai Nana and Aida. I had seen Nana and Mary before so I thought I’d give Aida a go.

Aida is early 20’s, slim and ‘tight’ body, with a-cup breasts, flawless skin and trimmed puss. She has a lovel, sweet face and a gentle manner about her.

I asked for a hard massage and received and rather soft one. The massage itself was quite good and she covered the arms and legs and back and a great butt massage.

Now, there were two rather strange things about this punt. The first was the background music. It feels really strange to have my butt massaged to Silent Night, Amazing Grace and How Great Thou Art. It’s hard to get excited when you’re Jewish boy surrounded by all these iconic Christian songs.

The second strange thing was Aida did a great butt massage and felt around little Jack, but there was no tackle tickle. Oh well, nothings perfect.

At rollover time I negotiated and tipped for her being naked doing the handjob and she was very very lovely. The handjob, while not great, got me over the line. It was well worth the time and expense.

On a more gastronomic notes, those wrappers didn’t tend to stay with me so had to stop off at McDonald’s and buy and Big Mac. Of course I had to remove the beef patties, the lettuce and the cheese, which left me with the two buns and the pickle chips, but that’s a yarn for another time.

See youse all soon.

Jack

well, some-things are just meant to be...

I caught up with my dear friend JK for a late tete-a-tete at the paddy's market food  court, he filled his gob with noodles and msg, while I spooned delicately at some ice cream. That's the kind of folk we are, so bare that in mind if attending a drinks night 

We talked a while, fixed the worlds problems and then went our separate ways. 

Just prior to our departure, I made the following statement. I have to go get a haircut, I will not go to Bellvue St, I will not go to Billy's, I should do some shopping.

MGMJ (my good mate jack) considered this for a couple of nano-seconds and pointed out that I had not included King St  in the list, I now wish I had!

I headed off into the afternoon city traffic, and low and behold, made a heading for Newtown, and not my barbers, who'd a thought it!

Got introed  to Mary and Amy, chose Mary, got told Mary now had a booking but that Amy was good good good.

Must have sucker written all over me, unlike my friend JK who has some kind of secret pact with Miko the mamasan, whereby she only lines him up with the real deal, .... or is that the sure duds???

Anyway, into the room, $40 for 45 mins, I ask for a 'sexy' massage, not really wanting too much back work, more the lil HB work if you get my drift.

A bit of talk and wandering hands, ho hum, then flip over after about 15 mins, I ask if she does any extras, she implies that it is only her second day, so I have to make an offer for what I want. What with her bad english, and my non existent chinese, it turns out to be an extra $50 for a  nude BBBJ, but with no CIM.

Not the best deal in the world, but I agreed so we got on with the job.

All in all a fair to medium BBBJ, not very DT, I had a little grope and got over the line.

I was offered a head massage but declined, and was out of there with about 10 mins to spare.

As I headed out the door, Mary was sitting in reception waiting for the next customer, WTF! Grrrrrrrrr

Then I went and got my haircut.

After a fine luncheon with EMP, i headed to 501, and was told by the mamasan that she had no young lovelies available. Who do you have I asked, JoJo she replied, well, then I will see JoJo for an hour was my retort, knowing full well that a JoJo in the hand was worth at least 2 young lovelies in the bush, so to speak.

And so it was, another wonderful hour spent with JoJo, no massage actually happened, but lots of snuggling did, making HB a happy little camper and putting a smile on his face for the rest of the day.

Hi All,

Well, as you may have noticed I am not hanging around 143 Marrickville Road like I used to. I've discovered that this joint is not good for my mental health. Recently as a result of going there so much I have begun to suffer delusions of grandeur. I've started to think that I might be the Messiah, the 'Chosen One'.

How can this happen? Did Mrs. Kerouac raise an egomaniac? No! It's the way the working ladies treat me there. Every time I go into the joint the moment one of the wl's sees me in the reception room she says, "Jesus Christ! Are you back here again?'

Folks, those types of comments have started going to my big, not little. head.

So, today I am sitting across from the lovely Carol at 501 and asking her who is available. Carol is the opposite of Billy at 143. With Billy when you shake hands with him you have to count your fingers afterwards. That bloke will steal the words right out of your mouth. He's a weasel and if there was a weasel around here right now I apologise to it for comparing it to Billy.

Where was I? Oh, I remember, I was talking to lovely Carol and I asked her who was available. She said Anna and as I had not seen Anna before, Anna it was.

Now Anna is in her early 20's, rather plain faced, solid built not fat young lady, with what looks like natural D cup breasts.

The massage was pretty good. Anna knows what to do, but seems to lack experience and her technique is not a smooth as it could be. For example, she did a good back walk and made all the right moves, but they were a bit clumsy. Hopefully more experience will iron out those kinks in her massage strategies.

She provided a nice tackle tickle before rollover time. It was then that I began to ask about extras, but the look on her face was as if I was asking her to plot the telemetry for the next space shuttle to rendezvous with the International Space Station. In other words it was no soap ladies and gentlemen.

Anna did a very good handjob and placed herself perfectly out of reach when she did it. (So at least in that area she's got the routine and technique all worked out.

There is something innocent about her and like almost all the other ladies here she is a student.

Anyway, I'm off to Bondi Beach to practice walking on the water.

Until we meet again ta ta.

Hi all,

Let me start by saying I appreciate the feedback some of you have given me in pms regarding my reviews, but in spite of that I plan to keep writing them.

Let me also note that while this may seem convoluted, but if you hang with me on this it will become evident to both of us that I am not casting pearls before swine.

This is a review within reviews.

My mate 'Fast' Eddie Felson is a small time businessman. I mean small with an un-capitalised 's'. If I could I would have typed 'small' in 2 point font. It's not that he's a small thinker, but he is a real small timer. Let me give you one example. 'Fast' Eddie wanted to open up a GoodYear blimp business in Australia. He thought he could hire out a series of blimps for sporting events and make a wad of dough out of it. He formed a two dollar company called Hot Air Blimps Pty. Ltd. Unfortunately there were 3 flies in his ointment. They were:

1.	The 'Goodyear' name and the term 'GoodYear Blimp' are trademarked and copyrighted.
2.	Eddie knows nothing about blimps/airships.
3.	His working capital was miniscule.

Result? Like his prospective blimps,  the business never got off the ground.

His latest two dollar company is Surry Hills by Night Pty. Ltd. Eddie feels he can take tourists around this punting utopia and make money hand over fist. At present he operates out of a 2001 VW Bettle, but plans to get a caravan if things improve. He uses a compact cassette player to provide the narrative for his tour and he has given me permission to quote segments of it for your benefit. Below are direct quotes from that erstwhile tape and represent Part 1 of his tour of the more sordid aspects of 'The Hills'. 

Kyoto on Commonwealth Street: "This is a joint that looks like it's hosed down every night after the suckers leave. Most of the girls here are really amateurs and it makes the service patchy. Despite the name, most are Chinese and have an 'I don't do list' that stretches from Sydney to Beijing and back again."

ACE on Bourke: "A more demoralised line-up could never been found. The ladies all literally line up in a single line and look like they are waiting for their last cigarette before the firing squad. The service is standardised and is, to be kind, robotic. On second thought, robots would show much more passion."

12 Bellevue Street: "Close your eyes. If you see what you are doing, who you are doing it with and where you are doing it you will be scarred for life!"

15 Bellevue Street":  "This is a step up from 12 Bellevue, but that's like saying Russell Crowe is a better tennis player than Brittany Spears. They have two different rates in this joint. Thai girls cost more than Chinese ones and I heard the following conversation when I was last here:

Chickenhead: Well, Tuk-Tuk (Thai) here's your $80 split for the hour. Mai-Ping (Chinese)) here's your $70 for the hour.

Mai-Ping: Why I only get 70 and Tuk get 80?

Chickenhead: It's not my fucking fault you're Chinese! Blame your fucking parents and talk to them about it!"

Tiffany on Albion Street: "There always seem to be a damn party going on there in the background and I'm never invited. The joint seems full of wood panelling and who the fuck wants to fuck wood! Some of the ladies are cute although they tend to deduct 10 years from their developmental clocks. Usually the best looking dame in the joint is the receptionist and you've got Buckley's with her. Be sure to take out a second mortgage as this place aint cheap."

Big and Beautiful on Waterloo Street: The ladies are huge and the joint is small. The receptionist had more tattoos on her than a rugby league player. Everything looks in a state of disrepair and they only have one shower. In that shower they have a large bottle of Listerine, but God only knows how you can use it without getting the cuddies of the 10,000 jokers who wrapped their lips around the mouth of the bottle before you!"

Enough of this, Part 2 will appear in a later review. Needless to say I got 'Fast' Eddie to drop me off at 501 King Street to forget about this harrowing experience.

Being Sunday the line-up was Daisy, Nana, Anna and Mina. Having seen the other 3 I decided it would be Mina.

Mina is mid-20's, c-cup, a bit chubby, wears glasses and looks the real girl next door type. Her English is functional, but don't think you're going to get into a deep discussion of Sartre's notion of existentialism and what 'being-in-the-world' means and the experiential aspects of phenomenology. It ain't gonna happen.

What Mina can do is provide a professional massage. She massages the works from head to toe and knows how to deal with the various muscle groups. She knows you have hands and feed and consequently does not ignore them.

Toward the end of the massage, Mina does a nice sensual massage with a great tackle tickle and after rollover time does an effective handjob.

Once in the room she wanted to take the glasses off, but I enjoyed seeing her with them on. She's cute, but not pretty. After 'Fast' Eddies tour it was a nice way to relax and recognise there is still goodness to be found in the 'adult' industry.

Until we meet again.

Jack

only a short review this time...

Joy, a  new girl, early 20's, tiny and petite, but strangely a little tummy fat. From Hong Kong, terrible english.

Good enough English to tell me $30 for a cbj and $50 for FS though 

Had sex from the start, then spent the rest of the hour with a wishy washy massage, so can't comment on her normal massage skills.

Seemed like a nice girl, so recommend.

Hi All,

Phone: 95571830

I still get little respect.

I was in a delicate mood and decided to bypass my barber Effie today and instead talked with Amanda at Gloria Jeans. It didn't help much as the following exchange indicates:

Amanda: You seem a bit down in the dumps Jack.
Jack: I am. I don't think I've received enough recognition for what I've done.
Amanda: What do you mean?
Jack: Well, I've never had a dinner thrown in my honour.
Amanda: You've never had a dinner?
Jack: That's right. In terms of being honoured I've never had a dinner.
Amanda: Maybe haven't done enough to deserve one.
Jack: (sigh) You're probably right.

I went to my table, started drinking my small cappuccino and reading the adult section of The Telegraph when my mind drifted to others who had never been honoured and had a dinner.

Cain, son of Adam and Eve: Cain after killing Able fled east of Eden and met a woman out there and upon seeing her exclaimed, 'Where the fuck did you come from?" Never had a dinner.

The Lone Ranger: The Lone Ranger who said to Tonto, "So what's so strange about a mask wearing white guy who roams aimlessly around the old West and lives with a male Indian?" Never had a dinner.

Prince Charming: Prince Charming who said to Snow White "You've lived all these years in the middle of nowhere with seven asexual dwarfs? Not a pretty picture". Never had a dinner.

Marilyn Monroe: Marilyn Monroe who while listening to Rachmaninoff's Concerto 2 said, "I knew it was classical music as there was no vocal". Never had a dinner.

The Dalai Lama: The Dalai Lama who when asked his opinion of the Greens Bob Brown replied, "If it's brown flush it." Never had a dinner.

Julia Gillard: Julia Gillard who said, "What do you mean I should get a makeover? This IS my makeover!" Never had a dinner.


So, anyway I arrive at old 501 to be greeted by the sensual, attractive and mature Miko who tells me only Tina is available. So, Tina it is.

Tina looks to be in mid 20's with stylish, shortish hair that has been tinted a brownish colour, has A-cups, slender and English that is pretty good when she wants it to be. She is cute without actually being pretty.

How can I describe the massage? Well, it wasn't bad and it wasn't great either. She spent most of the time on the back, but did recognise that I had both legs and arms and hands. So, she touched most of the bases, but in a rather forgettable fashion.

During the back part I asked if I could touch her leg and she said 'yes'. I then said to myself "Self, this all looks rather promising", but it was all a false hope.

At turnover time I knew nothing big was remotely on the cards for me. She looked at my cock as if she wanted to handle it with a set of tongs, or perhaps in my case, tweezers.  She has an innocent quality that is endearing if you're having yum cha with her in Chinatown, but is not welcomed at tug time. She started the tug as if she was trying to restrict the movement of a python and the corresponding non-stimulation of this made little Jack as dead as the proverbial doornail. In the end she got as a rhythm thing going and I got over the line. It was then towel time and time to say good-by. Neither of us had to brush away a tear as we parted.

I bid farewell to mamasan Miko and she smiled that knowing smile of "I know nothing really happened to you in there and the earth did not move for you".

I only get a modicum of respect.

Jack

Hi Admin,

It doesn't work like that, I have to earn it by doing something significant.

As my barber Effie pointed out to me recently:

"Jack, you haven't done a fucking thing worth mentioning in your whole life!"

Sad, but true. (Read my forthcoming review of Mina to see where I stand now.)

When to 501 on Monday morning,the lady in the reception told me that all MLs were busy until 12pm a young Ada will be availble.So booked Ada or an hour.
Turned up 5 mins early and was told Ada was running late and saw Cindy in the waiting room.She looked young (early 20s)hot and sexy so took her for an hour.
Average massage skills,tip $30.00 for naked,nipple sucking and HJ finished.
Out of the door at 12:45pm,it's almost 15 mins early!!
Next time may try young Ada.

Reception here is either Miko or Carol.

If you were bilked for time discuss it with them. If you do so in a pleasant attitude you will find they will respond reasonably to your complaint.

After my earlier failed punt at 708 George St, decided to head to the 'strip' at Newtown.

Was allocated Cindy, who like naughtybaby notes, is young and very sexy. Has been in Aus for about 4 months, working here for about 1 month. Spends her days studying accounting at Uni.

Either got her on a good day, or she has developed her massaging skills, as she gave me quite a reasonable massage.

After about 20 mins she asked me to turn-over and asked if I wanted a HJ. Of course I accepted. I found her HJ skills quite good (but I was longing for a happy ending!), and she got me over the line in good time.

Cindy also allowed me to have a feel through her clothes - upstairs and downstairs. Would definitely be keen to explore any other options available with Cindy. She works Sunday and Monday.

All up $30 for 30 mins - all up would rate my experience 8/10. Goes to show YMMV!

Cheers,

BAB

I was there at 10:30am!

Booked Ada at 10:30 am for an hour session.
Entered from back door ,saw Cindy sat in the waiting room.She smiled to me ,returned to a big smile hello.
Told Carol have booked Ada,Cindy looked disappointed! 

Ada is a early 20,slim happy girl,was leaded to a room that located in the middle, avoid to listen Carol answered the phone.
Did not see Ada bring any hand bag to the massage room so there may not much extra available.
Do not ask for strong massage but nice to have soft touch with oil from her little hands.
She dressed a mini chiffon skirt that allowed me to touch her legs during massage.
Very soft skin and nice firm bottom.
20 mins left on the clock,it's turn over time,agreed $30.00 for naked.
Sucked her A to B cup tits,fingered her little pussy,got wet very quick, started moaning and seem very enjoyed.
Nice HJ skills ,because of her moaning that let me over the line easy.
Warm towel to clean up,some kisses before go.
May ask some extra next Monday.
She works Monday,Thursday and Saturday.

Cheers.

Howdy All,

Before I write about the lovely Cindy I should first tell you the context of this punt.

Prior to going to 501 I was sitting in my office, in' the zone', writing creative material. (For those of you who don't know my office is the first table on your left as you enter any Gloria Jeans.)

I was wi-fing away and the creative juices were at full tilt when mine host Elvisina approached and enquired into what my frenetic pounding on the old keyboard was all about. (Note: I always bring my desktop computer in when working at Gloria Jeans.) Well, I told her that I was putting the finishing touches on my latest book The Poetry and Rhyme of Jack Kerouac. She persuaded me to read one of my works and so I read the following after which a short conversation ensued. 

There once was a tranny named Sandy
Who had a daytime job as a nanny
Although she made nappies quick
She had a small dick
But she claimed her arse was just dandy.


Jack: Well, what do you think?
Elvisina: You're lucky I am not slicing up the banana bread right now.
Jack: Why is that?
Elvisina: Because with that banana knife I'd turn you into a post-op.
Jack: It was that bad huh?
Elvisina: Worse than that! Can I ask you a personal question?
Jack: Sure.
Elvisina: When are you leaving?

And so I left.

As is typical of me I wandered aimlessly only to wind up outside of 501 King Street. I entered to be greeted by mamasan, the sweet Carol. Carol is nice, but I have missed Miko who has taken a trip to China for several weeks and won't be back till late October.

There were two ladies on duty. One was sexy Thai Nana and the other was Cindy. As a punt is a punt I thought I'd see Cindy as we had not met before.

Let me begin by saying that this Cindy is not 'the Cindy' who worked here a year ago. The old Cindy is one of the few working ladies who really pissed me off by asking me to cough up $70 for a handjob. Shucks, I know I look dumber than shit, but give me some credit for having two neurones to rub together in my cranium! I got so hot under the collar I got up off the table and left the joint only half dressed. This was not that Cindy.

This Cindy is early 20's, A+/B-  cups, pretty face and slim, tight body. She is a student and you guessed it, is studying accounting. She has excellent English and a sweet manner about her.

She asked if I wanted hard or soft massage and I opted for hard. What I got was medium.

In terms of doing the back, butt and legs she was fine. I particularly liked her massage of my butt. While not designed to be sensual, it felt that way. She forgot that I had any arms or hands, but nobody's perfect.

While there was no tackle tickle, her hj technique was surprisingly good and I got over the line easily.

While I will probably not see her again, she was a pleasure to be with and I have certainly had worse e.g. the old Cindy.

My next review will be Mona and the Pillars of Hercules.

See ya'll next week.

Jack

Dropped in to this place just before closing time last night.

I think her name was Alice, but she mumbled worse that a WL with a mouthfull of...anyway, you get the idea...

Alice would be in her late 30's, slim figure, full A cups, didn't find her attractive but wouldn't call her ugly either. Say 5.5/10 for looks.

30 mins for $30 was the damage incl HJ.

Alice started with a fairly good massage of my back & shoulders. After about 5 mins of this, she started with the feathery tackle tickle and kissing of my lower back and upper legs. Then asked me to turn over. Offered to take her clothes off (for an extra fee I assume) but I declined.

First smile I got from her was when she oiled up little BAB and started working on him. Her technique was fine, but as I take a little time to 'take off', her smile quickly vanished and was replaced with a very bored look. Anyway, got over the line with about 15 mins to go. She left the room and washed up, and returned for a quick head massage.

20 mins of the 30 min session gone and she was out of there. Got the impression she just wanted to go home.

So paid for 30 mins, got 20, massage was good but brief, HJ was also good, from a lady who for the most part seemed disinterested and not what I would call attractive.

Would I go back? Yes, as you can find some really cute young ML's at this place. Would I see Alice again? No.

Cheers,

BAB

Hours of Business: (if known or applicable)  closes at 9pm

Prices: 60 per hour plus minus tip

Age: 30ish

Size/shape: busty, slight belly but soft skin

Nationality or Ethnicity: chinese, possibele mix

Saw Sasa at this busy establishment.  boss always on phone taking bookings, at least 2 other blokes in hallway.  Good news is parking in rear with rear entrance.  5-6 girls on per day.  Sasa is probably early 30s claims to be from hong kong.   Firm massage but im not really that stiff with plenty of suggestive sweeps/movements.  10min lips on nipples.  No discussion of tip but takes out protection for fullS from small purse.  Was taken off guard by directness, but she seems like a nice lady who enjoys her work as busy as it may be. Albeit i wasnt ready for this at a rnt

Rooms are clean and tidy, small bed/bench.  No shower avaible, with toilet in common area.

Services:  see above, i tipped 50, she seemed happy with this.

Value for money/recommend?: good value, recommended if u dont mind no shower.

My experience/comments: Other girls available including nana who looks young and joy.  Few other older ladies also available.  I think they aim to please as boss is nice and friendly doesnt mind if u wait in case booking are no shows.  lack of shower and a reasonable waiting area might be a problem for some.

first review, have fun guys.

G'Day Folks,

Before I do a review of Lily I need to give you some of the context. Be patient with me as it will all come out in the wash.

I must confess three things right up front. First, I am a shit magnet for strange people and events. Second, I sweat the small stuff in life and let it get on top of me and third, I can't resist extras no matter what way, shape or form they are offered.

 My nephews Efrem Zimbalist Farquar and Edd 'Kookie' Byrnes will testify that weird shit, some of my own making, swirls around me. The day of this punt was no exception. As I was leaving my place the phone rang and against my better judgment I answered it. On the end of the line was some joker with a thick Indian accent and the following conversation ensued.

Joker: I am Rashid and I am speaking with Mr. Jack Kerouac.
Jack: Yes Rashid, you are speaking with Mr. Jack Kerouac.
Joker: I am speaking with Mr. Jack about Vodafone.
Jack: You are NOT speaking to Mr. Jack about Vodafone.
Joker: I am speaking to Mr. Jack about Vodafone.
Jack: You are speaking AT Mr. Jack about Vodafone, but Mr. Jack's  NOT listening about Vodafone.
Joker: I am not speaking to Mr. Jack about Vodafone?
Jack: That's the first thing you've said that I agree with. Bye.

I get so tired of these guys calling me at every God forsaken hour under the sun. I know they are only doing their job, but their job is to make my life a minor misery. 

I was annoyed after Rashid called, but there was more to follow,

Before my punt I was meeting a mate at the Coco Cabana at the Cross. On the way I was desperate to pee and stopped off at the public toilet at Town Hall. In that toilet is a long trough that everyone pees into and when I approached it there was a goober at each end of it pissing.  So, I decided to stand in the middle, but the dude on my left finished and left so I took his place at the opposite end of the pisser. That's when the following conversation ensued with the remaining clown:

Clown: What are you doing?
Jack: What do you think I am doing? I am pissing.
Clown: I mean moving all around.
Jack: I like six degrees of separation when I piss.
Clown: What the fuck are you talking about?
Jack: Mate, take your left index finger and poke yourself in the right eye as hard as you can.
Clown:  Why would I want to do something stupid like that?
Jack: Trust me; the answer is in the act. Do it.
Clown: You're dumb fucking smart arse aren't you?
Jack: Yes, absolutely. Come back tomorrow and I'll teach you how to suck eggs.

I was in a foul mood at this stage but pressed on to the Coco Cabana and drank some coco. My mate forgot to show up!

Finally, as I have written before, I am an extras man. I love upsizing at McDonald's and KFC. I'll eat everything in the those joints and come out looking like and with and the intelligence of the GoodYear Blimp. If a working lady was to offer having me submerged in Sydney Harbour chained to concrete blocks as extra for $50 I grab the deal with both hands. Extras make me feel like I'm travelling first class rather than economy.

I think you've got the picture now. I was edgy and strung out when as my destination loomed in front.

I arrived at 501 and papasan Dave told me two girls were available. One was Thai Nana who I have seen before a few times and the other was Lily that I had also seen, but totally forgotten. (Note to Jack: Scratch Lily from your 'I've got to see her again' list and add her to your 'I won't forget this one again' list.)

Anyway, Lily is mid-twenties, a- cup breasts, absolutely flawless skin, great body, trimmed pussy and lovely smile. She has excellent English.

Almost as soon as I got in the room I upsized to a nude body-to-body.

She stripped off to reveal a lovely body with a copper coloured skin finish about it. "This is going to be great", I whispered under my breath. WRONG!

I guess the body slide was ok, but she started talking and telling me her philosophy of life. I HATED HER PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE. It could be said that if this lady had tickets on herself they were front row seats. There was not enough room in the cubicle for her, her ego and me. She went on and on about how she was going to hook up some time with a young, handsome, Chinese guy with big bucks. His courtship would consist of buying her expensive presents. It felt like she'd have a pre-nuptial agreement that said she got the works when he kicked the bucket. Given that sort of pre-nup I'd contact the Guinness Book of Records if he lasted five months to have him placed in the category of 'Unbelievable Survivors of Assassination Attempts'.

Eventually we wound up in a 69ish position with her tugging and talking about Asian guys with money and me looking at her puss. She had told me "You can look at pussy, but no touch and kiss!"

I came. I wiped up. I split.

Our parting interaction was as follows:

Lily: When will I see you again?
Jack: When I get big bucks and become Chinese.

See you all next week.

Jack

Age:28+

Size/shape: Pocket Rocket. GREAT body

Nationality or Ethnicity:Thai?

Services:RnT, B2B

Value for money/recommend?: YES

My experience/comments:
After 45 minutes of above average massage, she asked if I wanted body-to-body for $50 and although I thought it a little expensive for this place, I agreed and I'm glad I did! She climbed on top of me, starting slow, rubbing her great tits over my body. After a couple of minutes she rubbed more oil over me and started tugging on mini-me, all the while, playing with my balls. After about 5 minutes of this, she realised I wasn't going to cum so easily and started to get right into it...

She started grinding and writhing all over my body, pushing hard up against my cock. I could feel my cock on her wet pussy (although I never entered her). The tease of it plus the effort she put in was really hot. She kissed my neck and face and then, and I've never experienced this at any R&T before, she passionatlely kissed me for what seemed like an eternity. I was so horny, I just ran with it and started grinding harder and faster. After about 15 minutes, she got me to blow by sitting on me cow-girl style, leaning back so I had full view and easy access to her pussy (which is amazingly small & tight), and with a handful of oil rubbed my cock and every now and then slid it past her pussy.

Fucking fantastic!

My experience/comments: could tell the moment i saw her walk around the corner, she liked what she saw and she wanted some fun..
real GFE here, I had a great time, she liked teasing my cock and it felt genuinely like she wanted more.. the massage was ok, but flipping over was more on my mind, i asked her for a full naked massage before we began, which she gladly agreed to. she doesnt mind using oils, but when it comes to her jumping on board, she prefers no oil, so a hot towel quickly fixed that for her before she climbed on for some titty massaging on my back. she was heavily playing with my cock and eager to flip me over, which of course I was only to happy to oblige. Upon flipping me over she grabbed my cock and looked my deep into the eyes and asked if I wanted  blow job, of course for an extra $20 on top of the $30 I agreed for the full naked body massage.
she presented her pussy to me, which I didnt stick my tongue into but quite happily played with her clit and lips while she sucked my plastic covered cock.
Very enjoyable, will be back.

Hi All,

In order to properly review Jaycee I'll need to refer to two other people I know so that you'll understand the context of my experience with her.

These two people are my Uncle Woody and a lady from Nepal named Eckta.

My Uncle Woody inherited a farm from my grandfather and was the laziest wanker who ever walked God's earth. He's the only bloke I know who would wake up early so that he could take a nap. He'd often get up in the morning and stroll out to the peach orchard, throw a little dirt on himself, mess up his hair with his hands and go back and say to my Auntie Ester "Mum, (he  called his wife 'mum'), I got me one of those sick headaches and have to go back to bed!". He'd then hop on the mattress and snore like a buzz saw for the rest of the day. He lived to be 80, but if you subtract all that sleep from his 80 years he was probably awake for about 30 minutes in total.

I often went to Woody's farm to help pick peaches. Let me rephrase that. I'd often go to Uncle Woody's farm to do all the work. He had two sons Chock and Jimmy who were twice as lazy and three times as dumb as Uncle Woody. I remember once they were drilling some holes into a 2 by 4 and Chock put the drill through Jimmy's hand. When we used to go into town I'd quickly separate from the whole bunch so as to not be treated like a village idiot the way the town's people treated them.

I vowed at a young age I'd never be lazy like those clowns and my mother told me she'd kill me or drill through my hand if she ever had a inkling I was taking on their characteristics.

Now to Eckta, Eckta is in the hospitality industry and brother is she an arrogant, flirting twit. Every time she passes a mirror she's got to have a big toothy grin gander at herself. I could imagine in the morning as she looks in the mirror she says things like "I wish I was a man so I could fight over me!" She is so arrogant that she feels if she hadn't been born everyone would wonder why.

She's a flirter. She constantly flirts. She's not fussy. She'll flirt with any male from 8 to 80. (Uncle Woody would like that if he could stay awake long enough to notice.) When she flirts she bats her eyes and has a shit eating grin on her face that says "Ain't I a looker!" Folks she is NOT a looker.

Just so you know that grin is really a smirk. SHE'S A SMIRKER THAT ONE.

Ok, so I walk into 501 and the only available lady is Jaycee. She's in the dark cubicle waiting for some unsuspecting dickhead like me and I don't get a good look at her.

She starts with a very soft massage focusing on the neck, shoulders and lower back. It's all so soft at times I think I am in the room alone or am a bit player in one of Uncle Woody's many dreams.

After about 10 minutes of this, (I payed for an hour), she asks if I want my legs done? What? I thought it was a whole body massage, but her tone is "Please don't make me do this shit. I don't like to work". 

I am thinking well I might as well go for extras and we negotiate full service. Now mind you, all this is with me face down and me never having had a good look at her visage.  

I then roll over to discover she is a Chinese replica of that damn Eckta.  They both seem like they are from the same litter, I can imagine the father is some travelling ukulele salesman who enjoyed himself in Nepal, split from there, and shagged a chick in China.

Anyway, I quickly discover there is no bj of any type. No touching. No nothing. I gave up. I was not going to rise to the occasion and that as they say is that.

I asked her how long we had left and she says 35 minutes, I tell her I'd prefer she leave so I can have at least catch a cat nap. 

She leaves and I doze off dreaming of peach orchards, drills through my hand, village idiots and ukuleles.

Anyway, it's all good as they say.

Jack

Howdy Folks,

Today the lady of review is Thai Lina.

Before I get into the ends and outs of this punt I need to set the context. Yes, I know I always take a roundabout route, but the context makes clear what is happening in my punt.

Now punting is not an art form. It's gambling that you'll have a great sexual experience.

I want to discuss three aspects of the punting process. The first aspect involves the feelings regarding the punt, and this was manifest in this punt, and the second is the value and lack of value in adult forums and the third is how forum reviews are often ignored.

Much of punting is emotional rather that based on cognition. (For you Philistines out there 'cognition' refers to thinking.) Take my nephew Efrem Zimbalist Farquar. He's the only bloke I know who will stop off to have a punt on the way to a punt. He did this with me. We had agreed to meet in the City and punt and on the way to meet me he stopped off to have an RnT. 

Steven: Why did you have a punt before you punted?
Farquar: Seemed like a good idea at the time?

Another example of feelings and punting occurred when Farquar went for an RnT at Rooty Hill. (Isn't that a great name of a suburb to have a punt in?) There he was massaged by a milf that he didn't find at all attractive, but couldn't resist upgrading to full service. Not only did he upgrade to a person he considered a hag, but during the dirty deed the condom broke! It all turned out a mess.

Ok. So there's the first part of the punting saga that applies to this review.

The second part has to do with adult forums. You know, they can be very valuable in deciding where to punt. A venue with good reviews or a lady with a good reputation on a forum cuts down the odds of having a crook punt, but punting is not all logical and rational and forums are a two edged sword.

Let's take Eddie Fuchs for the dark side of forums. Last Thursday he saw Connie Mack, a private WL, and they really clicked. They went into some heavy dfking where they literally devoured each other's tongues, He was elated. Eddie debated whether to lodge a review on a forum. If he extolled her virtues then very Tom, Dick and Harry would have her. Yet, he felt so strongly about the punt he felt he had to review it.

So old Eddie decides to post and finds on the forum there is already a thread on Ms Mack. He read through the posts and notes a review by a punter who saw her immediately before he did and he read the following.

"My God that Connie is one hell of a dirty little thing. She gave me rimming like you wouldn't believe. She stuck that filthy little tongue up my arse as far as it would go. Man I haven't had a cleanout like that since I paid a visit to my proctologist Dr. I.P Freely and he gave me a barium enema! It felt like she sucked my intestines until they were squeaky clean."

Now Eddie starts thinking "Holy shit! I sucked on that faeces covered appendage!" He immediately tries to justify it all to himself. "Oh well", he thinks, "That's another item I can tick off my bucket list." (Note: Sucking on a dung covered tongue was never actually on his bucket list.)

Then Eddie starts taking action to deal with this tragedy. He first used four, one litre bottles of Listerine in an attempt to clean his gob out. Last time I saw him he was gargling with No Frills disinfectant. Eddie may go into The Guinness Book of Records with both the dirtiest and cleanest mouth in human history.

Finally, there are those who read forums and simply ignore the reviews. A couple of years ago I saw a WL who advertised in the local rag as 'Sophia the Greek Princess". She was the punt from hell. To make a long story short when I got there her fat mum was there too and mum heaped shit on both Sophia and me. I paid for an hour and stayed about 15 minutes and was ready to split. I felt lucky to get out of the joint in one piece. 

I wrote up my review of Sophia and afterwards several punters saw her based on my crook review. They even had the hide to complain that she was a total loss and rip-off artist. Go figure.

Well, let's get to the review.

I hadn't been to 501 for over a month.

I went with Farquar and he chose Jo-Jo who is the only lady I had seen there and she is one of the joint's star attractions.

I had two ladies to choose from. One was Chinese Judy and the other was Thai Lina. Judy had a round and pretty face and slim body. Since I've had a bad run with Judys I gave her a miss. I chose Thai Lina. 

Now I had read on an Asian forum that she wasn't much chop, but arrogance got the better of me and I was sure I'd break the ice of that cold heart of hers. I DIDN'T.

Lina is early 20's, a student, looked on the outside like C-cup breasts, but later discovered they were more A-. 

The massage wasn't exactly terrible, but it was terribly mediocre. She did an ok job on my back, but forgot I had arms and hands. She worked on the legs, but ignored the fact I had a backside. (Note: She kept a towel over it the whole time.)

When I rolled over she placed a towel over my private parts, pointed to them and gave the handjob gesture. (I thinking "Is the Pope Catholic and does a wild bear shit in the woods?" My nod meant yes.

Now, it was a crummy massage, I didn't like her looks and I had read bad reviews of her, but none of that stopped me. So I did the next logical step by upgrading to topless which I overpaid for by $10. (Normal price is 30, but stupid me paid 40.) When she took her bra off I saw those tiny, sad little A's and figured "Well, I might as well have a little suck anyway." I did not arouse her as those little nipples and they remained as flat as a tack.

Her handjob technique was like Aunt Agatha milking old Bessie the cow. I got myself over the line.

Will I ever learn? Probably not.

Will I get myself over the line by acting like Aunt Agatha milking old Bessie? No I do have a learning curve of sorts.

Will I seen Lina again? Not in this life ladies and gents.

Will I pay more attention to forum reviews in the future? I intend to, but then again punting is not really a cognitive art form or exercise.

Until next time,

Jack

Just returned from my first visit at this establishment.
I was greeted at the door by the mamasam and ushered into cubicle A... omg they are tiny. After a short wait, Nana arrived. I note from Slarty's comments that she was Thai, but I would have sworn she was chinese... but then again, the cubicle was dark, and I didn't ask, so who knows ?. Nana would be early 20's, size 8

I paid $55 for the hour.

Nana placed a disposable sheet on the massage table, which I thought was a good thing !.
I was offered the choice of a soft, medium or hard massage and went for the medium option. The massage was actually very good, just the right strength and she worked some knots out of my back (too many weights during the week).
The massage was coming to a conclusion and she offered hand relief (I get the impression that this is included in the price ?). I rolled over and she then offered body to body for an extra $50. She had a killer body, nice trimmed bush, perky boobs that were just bigger than a handful. I get the feeling that more is on offer if you ask for it.
The body slide stuff was ok, didn't mind touching and sucking....
She lubed up with the oil and wen to work, and whilst it wasn't the worst job ever, it wasn't fabulous.
The hot towel at the end was a nice touch.
Anyway, I got accross the line and felt that the massage was great value at $30, but the $50 extra wasn't worth it.
Will I return ?... yes, probably.

wow, didnt realise I had to sit for an exam, otherwise I woudl've taken notes.  was in the city and decided to go down to Newton to try this place out.  I've seen lots of reviews so was always keen on trying this place but never had the chance.  

THe place was busy, I didnt have an appointment and dropped in, had to wait 20 min to see the next available girl.   While waiting a guy came in from the back door, and decided not to wait with me ;P and another guy came in the front had a quick chat to the bossman and a drink of water before leaving... not sure if they came back afterwards. 

When the my girl was ready, she was introduced to me as Daisy.  Petite little thing.  Friendly and pretty.  She looks early mid 20s.  the Masage she gave was reasonably good, her hands slipped between my legs and bum crack a bit durng the massage to keep things interested.  When she was finished, she went and got a hot towl for me and wiped my back and had me turn over.  She asked about the HJ and I asked about extras, she said she'd strip naked for $30.  I took up on her offer and she stripped, and proceeded to give me body slide before getting me over the line.  THe whole thing felt very muchn like a GFE and she's a lovely girl.  I'd definately go back and see her again.  But I'd like to try some others here as well...

I know a few other girls offers other extras and a few doesnt and only stick to HJs... might be worth while to ask the bossman before going in.

Establishment (if applicable):  501 King Street, Newtown

Contact Details/Address: 9557-1830

Hours of Business: 10AM - 10PM; Julia works Tuesday and Thursday, but this might change once semester starts.

Prices:  $50/hour, seemed to include HJ but she asked $30 for nude

Age:   27 (stated by her)

Size/shape:  I am bad at sizes, but quite slim. With clothes off, still nice, but a little sag will be there in a year or two. Sorry, am a n00b at this, but she has a vertical scar below her belly button - is that a C-section?

Nationality or Ethnicity:  Chinese, from Sichuan

Services:  massage, HJ, DATY

Value for money/recommend?:   yes

My experience/comments: 
Not having the literary abilities of the esteemed Uncle Jack, I do not delude myself into thinking that a work of genius will result from this review. Nonetheless:
woke at 9:30, showered and got dressed, called up the place to book someone. As none of the girls listed here were mentioned by the mamasan, I went for Julie, the last mentioned by her in her list of girls. Booked in an hour at 10:15. Turned up at 10:15, in the room with one shoe off, only to be told that bookings are only taken to commence at the half-hour. Accordingly, I ducked across the road for a caffeine fix. Returning at the appointed out, I was ushered by the mamasan into Massage Room C (I think). Tiny, but well-appointed and appropriately relaxing music. I like the atmosphere. Clean, but not shower facilities that I was made aware off. Then I waited for some 5-7 minutes for Julia to arrive. She stuck her head around the door (me sitting there naked). Having paid the mamasan $50, I put another 50 note under my phone on the little table (not sure if she noticed it or what it implied).

Lovely smile. Some makeup, but not over the top. Beautifully slim. Looked to be in her 20s, but could have been a very hot 30.  No regrets here. Proceeded to massage, some oil, nice talk about what she is doing. I asked if I could touch her, so took opportunity to touch those nice slim legs when she was near my head, and managed to slide the hand up between them, without actually touching the endzone, however.

She is studying Marketing (2 year course) at the CQU 'campus' downtown. As appropriate for marketing, her English was quite good, and the conversation was great. We laughed a bit; very engaging personality, lovely eyes, always smiling. Around 30 minutes in, she went for the hot towels (one for back, one each leg).

Turn over time, she started and asked whether I wanted (her) naked. I said yes, she said $30. She proceeded to the HJ, nice and gentle, this was arousing. I asked if she would lie down and if it was Ok to kiss her (body). Yes to both, so I started on the nipples, but not much reaction. Kissing across and down, she seemed to like it. Went for the area where the tummy meets the legs (you know, that little sensitive hollow on each leg), then down to inner thighs and lower. Asked her if I could kiss 'there' and she said OK, but be gentle. So to DATY. She is a clit girl, so no sense going any lower, and have to start gently. Felt a response and saw her responding after about 5 minutes work.

Now, I have read a lot about fake moaning, and one of the advantages of this place is that the installed walls to make the little room. Whether because of this or for other reasons, there was no moaning. Well, maybe a little whimper, but she seemed to be trying to remain quite. Nonetheless, a little DATY managed to get some arched back and a shudder, so it felt like I had done some damage   She pulled away, but I kept at it, and got a few more movements out of her. Went back to her nipples, but not much reaction, and she thought she would like to please me. So over again, but I don't really react unless I have mouth on pussy. So I got her to kneel over by mouth while I amused myself. A quick delivery and it was over.

A very pleasant experience. This was early in the day, I was probably her first or second client, so YMMV. Still, a very nice genuine girl. If she doesn't enjoy her job, then she hides it well. She seemed very happy, smiley and chatty without overdoing it.

Overall, a pleasand experience. Nice environment (at least my little room was) and a nice girl. Treat her nice and you have an enjoyable time. The orher girls sitting at the end of the little corridor also looked pleasing to the eye.

Would I go back. Yes. Would I see Julia again? Yes, althought would be tempted to explore the others.

One thing about this process: DATY gets me off, but I feel like I have taken a risk when I do it?  Guys who know more about this than me: What are the risks with DATY (assuming I have no bleeding gums, etc)?  Also, I feel emotionally empty. Have a girlfriend with whom the sex just isn't working, but when I come out of one of these places, I feel emotionally empty.

I have not been to this place for a while, but I recall last time I went , my ML was a young pretty girl called IVY.. Early to mid 20's, A/B ish cup, thin...... and the worst fucking punt I have ever had.
The massage felt like she was searching for Ticks, the conversation was ZERO  and you could hear the occassional "huff" which basically said ...." I really dont want to be here"...
I pursued through the massage and she asked if I wanted HJ...... I said "yes, but you can naked also"... usual 30 bucks...
The hand job was fucked... I could have got a better effort in a retirement home. Yankin and tuggin like it was supposed to separate from my body and noticed she had 1 eye on the clock.... 
As for touching.... could touch anywhere except pussy, as her legs were crossed and jammed shut.....  
I couldnt be bothered blowin as she killed the mood for me.. so I told her to stop...... and gestured her to come close so I could tell her something.... and I told her exactly what I thought of her and her efforts.... She was still being a fucking smart ass so I told her to get the fuck out whilst I got dressed.....
Mamasan could see I was fuming when I left via the back door... and asked me how was my massage. I gestured her to take a step outside and I told her if I ever get massaged by that miserable bitch again, I will not be coming back ... She seemed apologetic but we will see if or when I go back there.....
Ohh by the way, the place smelt like mould, I could hear the ML in the next cubicle talking for ever... and as it was late evening, everyone else in the shop not working were all chatting outside my door it seems.

All in all... the place is a dirty chinese shit hole.... poorly operated, but offers pretty well anything you want.. Reading the previous posts was helpful.

This is a review about Mia.

Before I get to the review proper there is a little ground setting required here.

When I first started punting, and I am sure this was true for you, I had no knowledge of the punting scene or of its terminology.

Terms like cbj, bbj, cim, cip, gfe, and pse went right over my head. They were like a foreign language. I can even recall how I scoured the net to get help before my first punt and was introduced to the term 'full service' Prior to reading what it meant I thought it was something that happened when you took your car to the garage for servicing. I could well imagine conversations with a mechanic like the following:

Jack: Hi Hezekiah. I need my car serviced.
Hezekiah: Do you want a partial or full service?
Jack: What's the difference?
Hezekiah: In a partial I just look at it and in a 'full service' you get the works.
Jack: An example?
Hezekiah: Well in a full service I'll fix that blown left front tyre of yours.
Jack: Oh, you do blown jobs huh?

I was naive, but it didn't take me long to learn the ropes of the adult industry. I did however discover that there were experiences for which there were no terms. Knowing this I originated the term foam. Foam stands for 'fake orgasm and moaning'. We've all had it. A WL thinks she can make us happy telling us how horny she is and how great our lovemaking is with a whole bunch of silly 'orgasms' thrown in that we're supposed to swallow hook, line and sinker. I guess some blokes do believe the charade.

I would like to introduce here a new term. This term if fapas. Fapas stands for 'fake agony, pain and suffering'. This is a ploy some WL's use to get you to back off and not insert your cock/penis/prick/dick/pecker too far in or move too much. In a way it's the opposite of foam and is a trick used to manipulate the sucker, I mean punter. You will see shy I employed this term here later.

WL mamasan Miko told me that young Mia was a bit of a 'fatso'. Now me, I like bbws and larger ladies so I deliberately booked her.

Mia is in her early 20's with natural D cups and gents I enjoyed sucking those puppies. She looks about a size 10 so is not really bbw material and she has an attractive face. (You now read just about all of the good stuff about this punt.)

I negotiated 'full service' and from the get go there was no movement on her part and she showed a pained look on her face before Kerouac Jr even arrived on the scene.

We had an interaction that went like this:

Mia: Jack, Jack, you are much too big!
Jack: Me too big? I feel like I am driving VW Beetle through the Grand Canyon here


It was a dud. I'd say she was like a starfish, but even a starfish does have some movement. I only did mish with her. I'd say instead of calling her a starfish she was more like a brick with nipples.

She gave me a handjob and I called it quits.

Until next time,

Jack

Massage was so so, spent too much time on my legs. Good oiled up HJ, but I need a little more sensitivity to come, so zip for me. So service average, but I'd go back to get my hands on that tight little body

Guy before me was not happy with het, finished early. Didn't feel right to speak to him, and already had Carmen booked. BTW my experience has been that being a walkin doesn't work, girls are busy and you'll wait. And the waiting space is a shit hole. Go get s coffee at the Turkish place across the street.

Hi Folks, (Further to the above review.)

Mary is early 20's, slim with A cups and responsive nipoles.

My experience/comments: I've seen her before with good experience. Pass by the shop this weekend though I go to see her again. Went in to the room and I spot something wrong already as she is usually smily, not this time. Still Some hug and chat then start the massage. I rate her almost zero this part as she is not so much of a massage girl. Then come to the second part, she is obviouly in a bad mood as she actually chuck her bra across the room. Then she just keep tickling me. I ask her if she is going to give me a BBBJ today. NO, which she usually do. Then I asked are we doing it today NO. I though WTF. You can't massage and you are not doing the extra, what the hell you doing here today. At the end she just give me a TUG and thats it. Because she has took her clothes off and I have to tip her $30 Total 80 bugs wasted.

I have to say she WAS a good girl but these things just should not happen in a shop, especially loading your bad mood on a customer is a big no no.

Base on my experience before, she is still worth tp try as she DID give me some very good GFE. But you guys better have a quick chat with her before handing the money over.

Hi Ladies and Gents,

You know you missed me! You are just too shy to admit it, but I know that tender heart of yours wondered where ol' Jack was. Well I am fine and knew you couldn't survive another day without me.

This review is about Li-Li.

Before I get all worked up here I want to make a couple of points regarding the use of RnT as opposed to going full service.

First, don't go to a massage place unless you want a massage. For reasons that will be evident in a moment it is usually not good value to get full service from an RnT should you prove successful at getting one.

Go to an RnT place when you want a massage. That is what you are guaranteed to get and if you need or want a good one that will be sufficient reward for your investment. Massage ladies frequently do NOT offer full service at any price and if you want full service a tug at the end may seem inadequate. Having written this, you may discover when a lady does agree to offer full service it is poor value. Why? Well frequently she will not discuss the matter until she asks you two roll over and that can be in the last 15 minutes of a half hour session or the last 20 minutes of an hour one. Usually the going price for sex is between $50 and $70 and gents and this is not good value for such short 'lovemaking'. (Note: If you become her regular client then often you can have full service for the cost of $100 to $120 all up, but it takes time and money to get to this sort of relationship with most massage ladies.)

Second, if you do go to and RnT place and want sex it can be both exciting and interesting to find out if it is on the cards,

As an experienced RnTer let me share some signs that full service is a possibility.

1. The massage lady dresses provocatively. She is in shorts, or has a low cut blouse or a tee-shirt that says something like 'Fuck Me!' You've got to figure at this juncture that pussy looms clear on the massage table horizon, Yes, gents that old non-verbal communication reveals a lot.

2. Her verbal repertoire contains terms of endearment such as 'Darling', 'Honey' and 'Babe'. In these instances you might discover the word 'fuck' lingers within her vocabulary.

3. When you lay on the massage table she may start by touching your bottom, or reaching underneath to brush the tackle a bit. This may be a subtle message that she is ready to 'free Willy' for you.

4. I have found it you gently touch her leg while lying down she'll give an indication if potentially more is on the cards. I remember once in Belmore a massage lady name Linda was massaging me and I touched her leg at the top of her knee high boots and she quickly pulled away, removed the boots and placed my hand on her bare leg. It seemed clear and was later proven right that she was willing to discover the more subtle, gentle and erotic experiences as witnessed by my adventures in my novel On the Road.

Sometimes, within the above four situations she will offer full service and the dirty deed will well and truly happen. If she balks at any of these earlier stages forget it. She will do massage only. Don't press the point. Massage ladies have a clear choice as to who they will offer full service to unlike some of their full service counterparts.

5. Lastly, at turn over time and when she starts touching your 'wee-wee', ask her if she offers 'extras'. She may not do full service. She may offer her top off or take off all clothes or a cbj or bbj.

What a massage lady will offer is her choice. Whether she offers anything can be based on her morals, life situation and how she perceives you. I have found that when I treat these ladies with courtesy and respect it goes a long way. For example, once I saw a massage lady in Burwood and sought to see if she offered more and she said a clear 'No". I accepted that with no hard feelings and enjoyed a really good massage and tug and in the end and tipped her $20. I had a good time because I was prepared to be content with a good massage. The next time I saw her she offered full service. So, a massage lady may offer one client only a hand job and another with a bbj and full service. Kindness, gentleness and respect go along way with getting massage lady approval. (This works in life generally too.) 

The woman of the hour is Li-Li.

Li-Li is early 20's, cute face and has A cup boobies with responsive nipples. Her English is rather poor, but functionally enough to communicate on a rudimentary basis. She is from Hong Kong and has been in Australia for a few years.

Her massage was poor, but her attitude was good. She forgot I had arms and hands and treated my back like it was a pillow that needed to be fluffed up.

A third of the way through the session she began an excellent butt rub and a fine tackle tickle. It was at this stage that I figured extras were probably within my grasp and my hunch turned out to be accurate.

I won't go into any blow by blow because she may or may not offer the same service to you, or you might get more.

I enjoyed being with her and will go back next week for a return engagement.


Till we meet again.

Jack

Howdy All,

This is a review of Ada.

I am aware when I read reviews that eventually I'll read that old chestnut that 'You get what you pay for'. In a sense that statement is true, but not true.

'You get what you pay for' is clearly true in some instances. For example, if you want a prestige car you're not going to get one by paying Hyundai prices. Another? A 3 carat diamond ring will cost you more than a 3 carat zirconia or diamonoid! If you want a high definition DVD recorder it will cost you more than a basic Sanyo DVD payer and you expect price to be related to features.

This is not always true in life. An example of this involved two dates I went out on. The first was with Sherrie Fedagynski. Now, she was the sister of my mate Wolomir. (Note: He had two brothers named Joe and Pete. God only knows where his parents dug up the name Wolomir!) 

Well, Sherrie was beautiful and the date cost me an arm and a leg. On our way to the restaurant I pulled up to the lights as they were changing to red and there was a slight screech of the tyres and Sherrie saying "Why did you stop so quick? Are you trying to wreck my good looks?!" It went downhill from there and any expectations of smooching in the back seat were quickly smashed by her 'Kerouac is a turd' attitude. Added to all this was the restaurant that had a ten place setting on the table. (Note: At that period in my life I used to eat my peas with a butter knife that I dipped into the mashed spuds and ran across the pea pile and ate whatever stuck to it.) It was all ghastly and I spent the entire evening continually looking into my wallet with visions of me back in the kitchen scrubbing out the pots and pans at 2 am.

Bonnie Katanagi was another story. She was a sweet Japanese girl that I dated a number of times. She encouraged us to go to inexpensive places. She was not pretty, but was very affectionate and a great companion. We'd go over to Manly and eat fish and chips and look at the beach and laugh and talk about everything and the dates cost almost nothing. I still smile when I think of Bonnie.

How does this relate to punting? Well, I often think there is an inverse relationship between how much you pay and what you get in the industry. Let me spell it out. I think in the adult industry often the more you pay the less service you get.

Take, for example, The Golden Apple at Potts Point. I went there a few years ago and saw a lady named Brooke. Now, the Golden Apple looks a 5 star joint. It had wood panelling and fancy rooms and high ceilings and even higher prices. Brooke was a real blonde bombshell. She said she was a model and I would believe it, but at this point sexual utopia went out the window. She had gone to the Sherrie Fedagynski School of Interpersonal Relationships. Right off the get go she told me no kissing and she didn't like her tits sucked, her pussy played with or any position except mish. Well, at least I didn't have to worry about my wallet as I did with Sherrie Fedagynski as I knew that wallet to be now empty! 

Now 12 Bellevue Street is another story. The joint looks like it was just strafed by French warplanes that confused it with Gadaffi's headquarters. It is super cheap at $65/30 and $130/60. The Asian milfs there make poor old Bonnie Katanagi looks like Gong Li in comparison. They look like they were exported in shipping containers by the People's Republic for re-cycling in another country.

BUT. For the money you pay, the service is unbeatable, Mate, when they get through with you the only things left is the melted fillings from your teeth and hair that sticks up like Don King's. These ladies engage in sexual practices that would make Caligula look like a monk and are so filthy I am ashamed to think of them myself.

This brings us to Ada and 501 King Street. The place is very clean, but downmarket when compared to places like Babylon, Midas and Oriana. The rooms are small and there is no shower. (Note the ladies wipe you clean with warm towels.

Ada says she is 22, but could pass for younger. She is slim, has small a-cup breasts and a very cute face. Her massage skills are not the best, but are good. She is quite pretty and has a sweet, innocent quality about her. Clothes off may be possible with a tip and she does a good handjob. She provides a good, honest service that transcends the $50/60 plus tips for any extra.

Sometimes you get more that you pay for and often you get less.

Till we meet again,

Jack

Person's Name: Cindy

Establishment : Newtown Massage Therapy Centre

Date of Visit: 30/3/2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 3/501 King Street, Newtown

Hours of Business: 10AM-10PM

Rates: $50ph + tipped her $50 in advance

Age: around 20-23, I think

Size/shape:  Very slim (but not anorexic), B cups (as much as I am a judge). Basically, HOT!

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese, from Fujian. 

Services Provided:  RNT, HJ, sucking nipples OK, touching down there ok (but was a bit sensitive), DATY asked for but refused (very politely)

Value for money/recommend?: Definitely.

My experience/comments: (Here you must give at least a general description of the experience which you have had - 25 word minimum is required to give fellow members an idea of time spent - "Ill be back" or "good value" is not a sentence or review. )

Cindy is a lovely, friendly (not to mention very sexy) girl. When I visited her a few hours ago, she was wearing one of those short dresses with jean shorts underneath, but sufficiently loose for some touching. She almost had a continuous smile and was really friendly. I have difficulty coming (that's not what I am there for anyway), so she apologised profusely. Her HJ technique was fantastic (probably third or fourth best I have ever had).

At the time I paid her, I tipped her $50 in advance, asking her to make me happy. That way the girl generally does the most that she is happy with. She made it clear that nude HJ is OK, but she made it politely clear (when asking whether I wanted HJ) that other stuff (BJ, FS I guess) is definitely not on the cards. Nonetheless, she has a nice firm body and running my hands up and down her legs was very enjoyable for me, and I think she enjoyed it too. She commented that I am naughty and nice. So I touched a little further into her shorts, and she said that it was still naughty but nice.

Cindy has been in the country for four months, and she says that she has only been working there for a few weeks. She only works Wednesdays, but seems in high demand - she was booked up from 10AM until I saw her at 2. I think she had a chance to get lunch after me.

Guys, treat her well, she seems very sweet.

Date of Visit: 2011.04.04

Contact Details/Address/Weblink:

Hours of Business: 10AM-10PM

Rates: $50/hour, tipped her $50 for extras

Age: Papasan asserted 23, seems right

Size/shape: larger Chinese girl. Not what you'd call fat, the huge natural jugs make up for the little extra she's carrying. Not for someone who likes'em slim.

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese, from 南京

Services Provided: massage, HJ, nude, fingering, no DATY ("maybe next time")

Value for money/recommend?: yes

My experience/comments:*
Booked over phone for 730PM. Had to wait a bit to start. When saw her, thought: oh no shouldn't gone the half hour. In fact, when she came in she was writing/messaging someone while I was on the table; not a good sign, but got my hour's worth anyway. The massage was quite good, even though had to remind her I wanted soft lower back due to an issue I have. As I didn't think this was going anywhere, didn't do too much groping during first part; what I did feel was firm, however:- a good sign.

Her massage was better than what you usually would have from the student types. In fact, quite good. Tackle tickle was less than I usually get. However, she had me oiled up good and proper, and spent substantial time in the bum region. It felt good, so nothing to complain about.

Turn over, and she seemed generally happy to perform the service. Allowed me to lick/kiss nipples, indeed she asked me to pull her close and hug her while going so. It seemed to genuinely arouse her. Also had fingers between her legs, and my work down there seemed to be appreciated (she was biting her lip). Had her lie down and gave her a bit if a fondle. In fact, I preferred to do this instead of lying there waiting for her to get me over the line. But her technique was definitely on track in that department.

While fondling her, her response seemed to suggest that there is more naughtiness here that may well come to the fore in later sessions.

Overall, not the slim firm vixen that I usually prefer, but a nice surprise nonetheless. I would consider going back to see her.

Mina says she only works Mondays.

Hi Guys,

First review on here, so go easy on me.

Person's Name: Sasa

Establishment: Newtown Massage

Contact Details/Address: 501 King St Newtown NSW

Hours of Business: 10am-10pm

Prices: 30 half an hour 50 an hour

Age: 30

Size/shape: D Cup

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Massage, possible BJ and Full service

Value for money/recommend?: Yes

501 is one of those cheap and cheerful massage places which always has a few young guns. Mostly massage here, but sometimes you can get lucky.

Came in last week to find one of my regulars had gone back to China, so settled with Sasa. I'd say she's about early 30s, probably quite a looker in her day, but still verynice. Big rack and extremely enthusiastic.

I'd been working all day so was absolutely beat, started off with a great strong massage, with a lot of action down where it counts. It wasn't long before I was as stiff as a statue. haha

After the 30 min mark, got told to turn over, and was offered full service for 50 or just naked for 30. As i was absolutely buggered, opted for just a naked handjob. Thing is, her hand skills are so good, she more than made up for it and within no time I was gone.

If you are after a good masseuse with the chance of a bit extra, I fully recommend Sasa. Never had full servic with her, but by all accounts, shes a real goer.

Saw Mia again today.
$100 ($50+$50) for an hour, as before.
She asked if I wanted oil or talcum. Went the latter, should've gone the former. The massage was less focussed than before, and I think I sent too much time touching her, which I think she took to mean she was absolved of responsibility to make me come

She's a nice girl, but I think I'm playing this wrong. Should I just go in and say "pleasure me"?

Will I be back? Yes, but might try another girl next time. Maybe it's only thrilling when it's someone new...

Hi All,

I hope you've all missed me as much as I have missed me!

"All things are temporary."
                           Gautama Siddhartha

This is a review about Sasa.

I have had pretty good luck with Sasas. There was one at 12 Bellevue Street that went from a working lady to a mamasan. I enjoyed her in both roles and she was a real wonder to behold in bed. 

But, things being as they are, her time came to leave. Was it because her visa ran out or she made a bucket of money or married a rich bloke? Who knows? What I do know is that her time came and she left. 

I still remember that rainy night I saw her last and I said goodbye and walked out onto the dark Bellevue Street. Why do things always have to change? Why does the good stuff only last for an instant and is gone? I am sentimental and yes I do think of Sasa from time to time.

This is a different Sasa. I have reviewed her before, but there is a particular reason I review her again that will become apparent later.

Sasa is mi 20's, very pretty face, natural D breast, trimmed puss and a sweet accommodating attitude. She also gives one of the best massages in Sydney with one of the best back walks I have ever had.

I had not seen Sasa for about a year and it was a pleasure to feel her experienced rub, enjoy some nice kisses from her lovely lips and enjoy her naked on the massage table, Yes, folks memories are made of this. Memories? Yes, Sasa leaves the job on May 10th. She has fallen in love and will be working as a beautician and only giving massages to women.

Like Bellevue Sasa I wish her all the best and folks that lovely face of hers will remain for a long time.

Why mention her when she is leaving?

Her sister JoJo works at this establishment and while older also offers some of the best service under the sun. She does a great back walk also and has nice, kissable lips as well, Treat JoJo with respect and kindness and she will return it in kind.

You know the old saying:

"The more things change the more they stay the same!"

Hopefully, I shall return sooner rather than later.

Sasa was also one of my all time favoutites as well. I saw her for a session this weekend after I heard that she was leaving. Been a while since I saw her but she greeted me like an old friend.

I booked the hour and she knows that I love her back walk. She would start by laying towels over me and using her feet, would push and prod all the way from my shoulders down to my bum. She then removes the towel and then liberally applies oil all over my back and legs and commence another back walk but this time, with a more soothing swedish massage movement. The combo of these just relaxes the tension away.

The fun bits begin when she flips you over and she disrobes. She has a body unlike most Chinese girls. Curvier with a set of magnificent D cup boobs. Without going into detail, we indulge in some sensual fun. All I can say, is that I walked out a relaxed and happy man.

She confirmed that she was leaving and moving into the beauty industry (didn'y say that she had found love!). I told her that I would miss seeing her as she offered the best combination of therapeutic and sensual massage I can find in Sydney. She has the rare combination of massage skill, great looks, killer body and a sweet, fun personality. She told me that she felt burnt out in the industry and wants to start something with a future career path. I am glad I saw her one last time and hope she finds success in her new venture.

To me, she was a super star provider and always delivered. Will be sorely missed.

Just looking for some relaxation and wasn't disappionted, would I go back for more, yes.

Her name was Ada and the massage was worth it even if there had been no "happy ending", although only HJ.

She was clothed for the entire session.

The HJ was ok but nothing to write about, quite a robotic action just doing a job. The massage was actually very good and would recommend her if you needed a theraputic massage. She was fine with touching, but more stroking or caressing and not a full grope.
If I was in the area and felt like a massage I would be tempted to go back, however, I don't think I go out of my way. I'd rather experiment elsewhere than go back.

She gave me good massage, I would rate it a 7. She put a lot of effort into it and great GFE. Getting down to the business end, good technique offered by Daisy. I hadn't released in while and I left very satisfied. I would highly recommend. She offered nude massage for extra but I would save this for next time..

Thank God for Chrome, it allows me to stretch this annoyingly tiny input window.

Person's Name: Kelly
Establishment : 501 King Street, Newtown
Date of Visit: 18th June (Saturday), 6:00-7:00 pm
Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 9557 1830
Hours of Business: 10am to 7pm (note new closing time. Mamasan told me that a lot of the girls are off on holiday (Chinese summer) and so this is likely to last until they come back).
Rates: 50ph + I find I get excellent service with an upfrotn 50 tip
Age:  mid-20s
Size/shape:  Body very slim taught and terrific, breasts slightly droopy but not in a bad "floppy" way" - more in an "I've lost weight" way.
Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese
Services Provided:  Massage, HJ
Value for money/recommend?:  YES
My experience/comments: 

DrBob has been somewhat toey of late. Maybe it's work, maybe it's the long-distance relationship which I want to break off but can't bring myself to, or maybe it's just because I have been horny evenings and my favourite, 501, has been closing too early of late: 7pm. Note, fellow punters (or puntees, if it is you that have been punted), that this place is hard to get into without a booking. I arrived this evening having made a booking 90 minutes in advance. There was some mixup, in that they had booked the lovely Kelly for me for 6-7, but also booked her for someone else for 6:30. If it was you, fellow punter, then I humbly apologise for redirecting her.

Nonetheless, I arrived, with the usual evening mamasan and a nice young mamasan, who would be pretty except that she was attorned with some item of clothing from that hideous Burberry brand that the noveau-riche tend to favour. That's what happens if you make a lot of money before developing any class. Oh, before you call me a snob: I have neither.

Anyway, in I go to the room to which I have been assigned. I am impressed. This place is quite a way better than your usual rathole, but sometime it just feels cleaner than usual. Today there was a little folded towel (and client-sheet) on the bed, with a little flower on it and a nice smell. The room was warm and an unknown fragrance hung in the air (probably put there to remove the smell of the bodily fluids of the previous client, but no matter).

The lovely Kelly enters, and tells me she knows me. Shock/horror?!!?  I did not recognise the face, nor the name, but when we got talking I remembered having previously talked with her. I remembered talk about her hometown, about what she is studying. For Kelly was formerly known as Tina at 10 Railway Pde Burwood (before that moved to 96 Paramatta Rd Homebush).   

So the massage turns into more a catch up with old friends   But a number of things have changed:
1. The reason I didn't recognise her straight away is that she has lost some weight (hence the slight breast droopiness, but still very nice).
2. Her English has gotten a lot better in the two years since I last saw her, with a distinct Australian accent.
3. Although I vaguely remember her being hot, she is very hot now. Those upper thighs are tight!
4. Her massage has become very competent.

Now, fair warning: Kelly is off to China for a month starting today (it's almost 1am on Sunday as I write this). So you will not see her until mid-July. I also noted that the Mamasan mentioned that Cindy, who I thought had left for two weeks some 3 weeks ago, is still on summer holiday. A few others were also mentioned as having  headed off. So are there slim pickin's at 501 in the future? Or are there gems to be found?  Someone game to TOFTT?

Anyway, Kelly's massage was very relaxing, and I managed to do a little groping while she was at it, but I was really there to relax. We chatted, I got massaged, it was good.  Some good tackle-tickle, then the turn over. Her clothes came off to reveal a lovely young body. Now Kelly is a bit of a mechanic, or at least seemed to be today. I think she endeavours to do her best, but the tool massage seems to be quite quick (I mean high frequency movements). Maybe I should have provided her with more guidance. Maybe I was just happy to watch her lovely body as she massaged the member. I don't know. But what I do know is this:

1. minimal eye contact with her while she was providing the service. Maybe she was making eye contact with LittleDoc, I don't know.
2. She is quite sensitive in her nether regions, and I think my groping was too hard. Once I eased off to a feather touch, I saw some minor reactions.
Eventually, I asked her to stop massaging my member and I just massaged her down there with my feather touch. But time, dear listeners was elapsing, and Kelly was quite aware of the number of remaining minutes.

All up, a very sweet and sexy girl, value for money, but could go far with some more guidance. Maybe some more time investment to build some raport, and perhaps then more might be on the table (so to speak).

She's a sweet girl. Be nice to her.

PS: I should have mentioned one of the neat things about taking a punt: Once girls' clothes are off, and the punter is also visible in his nude ugliness, the conversation is uninhibited and helps us understand that our lovely attending therapists are sweet people underneath all their physical hotness.

My experience/comments: Had the day of and needed a massage but my favourite lady wasn't there but anyways. Had to wait 2 hours after my booking. But well worth it. Ada was my massage girl. Pretty good massage but her hands and feet were cold. Noticed this because she walked on my back and they just didn't warm up. During the oil massage asked if she offered extras. $30 for clothes off. Which I agreed to.

Turning over she got naked and her fingers were all over my body which really gave me goose bumps. I has in heaven during the massage when she asked if I wanted blow job. How much? Another 40$. I said yes expecting CBJ but when she went down on my member i almost died. Held on for as long as I could. She has the most amazing body. Eye contact was dis-interested but the awesome BBBJ was worth it.

DrBob's quick review

date of visit: 4 July 2011, 6:30pm
place: shop 3/501 King Street Newtown
phone: 9557-1830
name: Rita
nationality: Chinese, from Shenyang; studying English downtown somewhere
description: age 20, size 8 top, size 10 below (slightly chubby thighs)
Price: $50/h (+ $50 as is my usual practice here, I paid an extra $50 up front askign her to make me happy)
Times available: Rita works Mondays
Asked for a sexy massage. This was repetitive and, although arousing, a little boring. After turnover, her technique was very mechanical, with minimal smiles. Did not get me over the line.
Caveat: however, since I did not get over the line, I asked her to lie down, and played/fondled. At this time, Rita seemed very playful. Top and bra came off, but her  shorts did not , but maybe it was that time - I didn't ask. Nonetheless, her playfulness gives me the feeling that with some investment of time (or a simply being a better looking guy than me) might get more happening. She may be worth the investment, but probably not for me.

Person's Name : Anna

Establishment : 3/501 King St Newtown

Date of Visit : Friday 22nd July

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 9587 1830

Hours of Business :  10am-7pm

Rates : 60 minutes $50

Age : late 20's

Size/shape : shapely/chubby

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage, BBBJ, hand relief

Value for money/recommend? : yes

My experience/comments : (Here you must give at least a general description of the experience which you have had - 25 word minimum is required to give fellow members an idea of time spent - "Ill be back" or "good value" is not a sentence or review. )

Went to 3/501 King St Newtown on the recommendation of a mate. Glad i did to pick my spirits up with all this rainy weather is Sydney at the moment. 

I was advised that i should call and make an appointment before going there as they can get bus y and you could be waiting for a while. So rang up and the booking was made so drove through the wet weather and parked in a side street.

The only downside to this place is that there is no discreet entrance, so open the door from busy street and in i went. From the outside though they do advertise as a legit therapeutic massage centre. 

The place inside is very small but very cosy. Was greeted and shown to a room with a massage table and another table where all the oils etc go.

Anna from China was my hostess. She is in her late 20's if not in her early 30's. Shapely girl with curves.

She told me me to get ready take my gear off while stepped outside for a sec. She returned told me to face down on the table. I was a bit jumpy and started to grope so she told me to calm down 1st the massage then play time.

The massage was quite good. 1st she massaged me with oil then she got a hot towel and wiped it all down. Rolled over on my back she massaged again with oil and then wiped it off with the hot towel.

Then she took her gear off, small tits but nice and a very hairy bush which i don't mind occasionally but do prefer them to be hairless.

She proceeded with BBBJ, was not the best but good enough, she didn't really get her lips around it. Her hand relief technique was quite good and she allowed playing with her pussy.

She made me blow, cleaned me up and onto massage again. By that time i was up again and asked for 2nd time hand relief which she was happy to again. Then time up.

In all was a very good experience, i will definitely be back  as the massage is quite decent and the happy ending very satisfying and friendly staff as well.

I spent 1 hour which cost $50 for the massage then i tipped the hostess another $40 for her good work.

On the way out though i went to the toilet and when i came out of the toilet there was this stunning young Chinese hostess sitting down. She must be a uni student or some thing. Next time i will be asking for younger the girls as this one was an absolute stunner, did not get her name but i will be back.

Call before you go 9587 1830, the massage is good and there is some young asian hotties in this place.

DrBob's quick review

date of visit: 22 July 2011, 6:00pm
place: shop 3/501 King Street Newtown
Shope now open until 8pm.
phone: 9557-1830
name: Ivy
nationality: Chinese, from Fuzhou; studying communications, won't tell me where
description: age 22, size 6 (lovely lithe little thing)
Price: $50/h (+ $50 as is my usual practice here, I paid an extra $50 up front asking her to make me happy)
Times available: Ivy works Fridays
Good massage. She seemed a bit withdrawn and cold to start with, but after some good conversation she became more at ease. Massage technique was good, but once the turnover came, she fired up. Had her period, so undies stayed on. However, Ivy's HJ technique is great. She offers similated kissing (i.e. comes in close, lips touch) and she kissed my nipples. Basically, if this was that sort of place, I would have had a body slide - she seems to have it in her and is not shy about getting on the punter. Lovely breasts, you can tell they are genuine:- very suckable!

Overall: Ivy is a lovely friendly girl, with a definite wild streak to her. I will be back

Value for money/recommend? : Not yet

My experience/comments: 

The massage was to be quite honest average at best and involved about 25 minutes or so rubbing my head. 

When time for the flip over a little conversation was struck and it was at this point that she mentioned how new to this industry she really is. 
Her technique at present is a little rudimentary though with a little time and confidence I’m sure it will improve. 
I may see her again if offered though I would rather her a little more time to mature her skillset.

Maggie I think (Had massage last Thursday) is unlikely to do more than HJ. Massage very soft, we spent a lot of time talking about her "boy" friend who is about 46, has a large house in Strathfield and a sports car and whether he would be a good longterm partner...I suspect no...

Hi David
I am sure you are right regarding what can be gleaned in a one hour massage
I am not sure Maggie mentioned handsome but I think the age was an issue for her, she was looking for a "simple man, small house, small car and maybe a cat...."

Hours of Business:

Rates:$50 p/h 

Age:22

Size/shape: Size 8 not chubby but has a little baby fat. Size A/B Bust

Nationality or Ethnicity:Chinese

Services Provided:massage

Value for money/recommend?:yes

My experience/comments: 
Went into this place and was allocated Ivy in one of the rooms. First impressions was shes looks young and is cute in a girl next door kind of way. She's not a stunner but she's attractive and looks innocent. 

This place has no showers like some other places but for $50/hr you wouldn't expect it to have one. I strip down to only my boxers as I wanted to her to focus on the massage initially.

Find out she's from China and has been a student here for 2 years. English isn't too bad but was pretty shy initially. She does open up a bit after you get the usual Q&A's out of the way.

When its time to turn over she offers to strip for $30 which I accepted. She reveals nice natural small breasts. Boxers come off  and she climbs on top for a bit of light kissing around my neck. She works her way down to my nipples at the same time rubbing junior. I play her a bit downstairs but she shied away when I tried to insert some fingers.

She's a nice girl and was quite hot to have her lying on top. Very much a GFE. I was pretty tired that day and Ivy's technique isn't that great so didn't to get over the line in the time left. I didn't mind today. Any other day might have been a different story. 

WIR: Probably not with the same girl. Saw a nice looker on the way out so I'm sure there are a lot of nice young girls here to try.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business :  10am-8pm

Rates : $50ph, paid her extra $50 upfront

Age : 24

Size/shape : lovely, taut, touchable skin; undressed has curves in all the right places

Nationality or Ethnicity : REAL HongKong, not one of these mainlanders pretending to be HK - her accent is definitely HK

Services Provided : massage+HJ; I don't know why Shark thought BBBJ was on the cards - he didn't mention getting one and I don't think she would give it

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, for eye candy and touching; But used a lot of oil for HJ and Ivy is more likely to get me over the line with her technique.

My experience/comments : 
She seemed a bit shy and conservative, but was pleasant to talk to. Is here on a one-year working holiday, currently 4 months in. Works here Wed and Fri, was filling in this Thursday for Daisy, who has gone back to China for a month.
She says that she currently works six days a week, the other days are at the same proprietor's Liverpool shop (anyone know which one it is?).
Her massage technique was great, after a tiring day it had me relaxed and almost nodding off. The HJ was nothing to write home about. BTW, Aunty Flo was visiting, so touching not really an option this time. Sucking her nipples was ok though, helped me get over the line, although they are sensitive.

Whatever it is I hope it wasn't something like a girl posted on there that she had quit the industry and then a customer saw her working there again and posted a photo of her in the shop (or just posted her photo). Must admit I am curious as to what happened as well.

It seems the former famous girls here call ricci has enter a beauty pageant, this shop was discuss extensively over there and people try to expose her, then the admin there delete 4 pages of post to help the girl cover it up. Their admin must be getting some good action for free.

Quote a recent post on the other forum

"No doubt you're also chasing this beauty pageant pussy as well the way you protecting her? How much does she cost? 

But what about your regular 501 pussy? You gonna dump her after you screwed other people over?   

And don't think that some of us haven't forgotten that you pulled a similar stunt couple years back in the 5* thread when you got admin to censor your girl's photo and any posters discussion around that. I won't name any names but she was a famous 5* Queen 

You have some nerve to come back into this forum and do the same thing again for this pageant pussy? 

We have our right to tell the truth and what we said is facts. 

This pussy used to work in 501, gave a rubbish massage but she had a nice body and face and depending on her mood extras were available.

She's gone off to join a beauty pageant and she expects that none of us would notice? Go into Chinatown and you still see posters of the contestants in sponsor shops. 

So now we get censored for stating her name and someone's posted a photo that is accessible from to the public anyway?

In any other country, if she had made it this would be major scandal all over the news media let alone a punting forum like ours. 

Admin I'm sorry but you've done your forum a disservice to censor that news. 

Don't fall for the trap of sympathy and privacy. She put herself out there in the first place."

My experience/comments : Tina is maybe a little older that others in this establishment maybe late 20s early 30s. Nice person very good hard massage. She has been there 3 months from Shanghai. Learning English, says she works only one day (presumably Wednesdays). English rudimentary
She have a great nude HJ which actually ended up as a tit fuck with handling of much wet pussy. Good enough for 50 + 30

Oh by the way, Ricci was very beautiful, I saw her once, sexy lady in a very tight short dress which showed a lot of panty. Into fashion and maybe a little bored at the time (as would be expected)

My experience/comments : There is no doubt that Ada is very hot but as with previous comment appears to be chronically tired. Having said that, it was an enjoyable hour. I took pity and went with light touch massage. She allowed much touching and offered clothes off at the end revealing one very sexy body. I would see Ada again

Read about Ada and decided to book without seeing her first. Walked in to see her and wasnt disappointed. She's good looking, sllim and looks quite young. Apparently 24. Didnt seem very talkative so may have got her on a bad day. Massage isn't worth talking about as its not hard enough and doesnt seem to have any therapeutic benefit. HJ felt good though. Used both hands and didnt rush it. Wasnt offered anything more.
Have to go back and try again cause i reckon she'd look great naked. she's on back in China right now but back in late October.

Person's Name : Sherry

Establishment : 3/501 King Street

Date of Visit : 27 September 2010

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business :  10am-8pm (but bookins starting to 7:30 can finish to 8:30)

Rates : $50ph

Age : 23-24 (didn't ask)

Size/shape : slimish, but has some baby fat and some lovely natural Cs (am bad judge of this; a handful each!)

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese, Beijing

Services Provided : RnT, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 
This was Sherry's first day. She has completed her business studies at UNewcastle and has been in Sydney for a month. Not doing her IELTS, but will stay in Aus if finds a husband. However, not pushy about this at all, she just mentioned it in response to some questions.

She told me she would be working yesterday and today, her roster is not fully set yet. Lovely innocent girl, great to chat to, and has a lovely smile. Her massage technique seems reasonably good, so the session was relaxing. In spite of her newness, her HJ technique was quite good too. However, because I talked a lot with her, by that time I was thinking of her as a person and not a hot ML, so I didn't get over the line.

She was happy to take her top off, and allowed me to remove her puppies from their enclosures for some suckage, although said activity seems not to do it for her. Her daisy dukes did not come off (I should have asked, but she seemed so innocent), but she seemed happy for me to grope her through the shorts.

Overall, with a little experience and, if she feels comfortable with you, she will turn into a nice massage girl. Although she is so sweet I would hope she wouldn't do this job for too long. Although her beauty is 'different', I found her very attractive.

Recommend her. I will probably go back.

She is here for a short time for holiday and to make money. Works most days I think and is also at the Liverpool shop. To be frank, she didn't do it to me. The massage was passable, but the HJ was quite bad:- same repetitive action, no innovation, I was bored.

Value for money/recommend? : Massage was pretty good for someone so young + the HJ was pretty good as well.

My experience/comments : A pleasant girl that was open to some conversation via her developing English skills. Not much else to really add except that the massage and finish were pretty well executed. 

I never book a particular lady as I prefer to let chance play a role in the experience but if I were to alter my ways Sasa is one that I would have happily see again.

Establishment : 501 King

Date of Visit : 8/10/2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business :  10am-8pm

Rates : $50ph, +extras

Age : 22 was told on booking, but suspect older than that. Maybe on the cusp of MILFdom, but still good looking and a bubbly personality

Size/shape : A little tummy fat, but that nice boobs.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage, HJ; allows fingering and nipple sucking, but not insertion

Value for money/recommend? :  Yes

My experience/comments : 

When I cam in, I immediately hugged her from behind and mentioned extras, but no price was negotiated. She was very friendly, starting the massage with that fingertip sensual massage style (I wasn't there to relax too many muscles ). After a few minutes of massage, she had no problems in my taking off her panties and playing with her thighs, butt cheeks and inner thighs - she was massaging my upper back by standing in front of me.

Turn over came about half an hour in, and while she was doing I can't remember what to me, I was playing with her butt cheeks, sucking her nipples. That turned her on, so I went with that. One arm reaching around under her and linking up behind her back with my other hand reaching over her shoulder. The nipple work seemed to get her aroused, so while holding my arms around her like that I squeezed and exerted pressure in her clitoral region. She seemed to enjoy that, and once or twice she just stopped pretending to massage and, seemingly exhaustedly, just rested on my chest. 

Now, I get turned on when I turn a woman on, and this was hitting all the right buttons for me. She either had or faked two orgasms, but thankfully FOAM. Her handiwork on little DrBob was great, and since I was still working on her with my fingers, she brought me close to climax a number of times. I stopped her the first three times, because stretching the process out is pleasurable. She was not very keen for me to insert my fingers into her, but she seems quite sensitive when your fingers are just near the entrance, so I managed to do some successful work there. As I saw her aroused, it certainly got me over the line, which is no mean feat.

Would definitely go back. Lovely personality, has been there for 2 months, studying English downtown, a real sparkle in her eye. Very playful.

Person's Name : amy

Establishment : 3/501 king

Date of Visit : 9/11/11
Few days ago I saw girl name Amy. Apparently she is new there. She said she was late mid twenties but I would say more like early thirty on a close inspection... Very sexy girl .. If u like a girl who is tanned skin/dark and on smaller side around size 8 you will enjoy this girl. She was wearing a very tight shorts with tight top..and she is A-B cup in boobs... I must say she had great attitude very chatty and good with her hands... I did not try her massage I went straith for the hand job as it takes me a while to get over the line..

She did not use oil but instead used some cream which felt really good... The hand job and balls massage was good... She allowed to fill her up and squze her ass and Tories for extra $10.

I just love it when she sits next to me on the massage table and looks u in the eyes while pumping ur cock...what a great feeling... I blew hard...

I have seen few girls in this place.. And apart from daisy who is always booked out and Ada who is also very good.. Must admit I will defenetly return to see Amy ...

I was also speaking to the owner David and he said he has 30 different girls working for him now in 2 newtown shops during the week...

Great value for money ...

Post Content: 
Person's Name :   Joy

Establishment :   Newtown Massage Therapy Centre

Date of Visit : 10/09/11

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :   501 King St Newtown

Hours of Business : Closes early in the evening, never seen it open after 10

Rates :   $50 per hour

Age :   Mid 20s

Size/shape :   Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity :   Asian, probably Chinese

Services Provided :   R n T

Value for money/recommend? :   Yes, but could hardly complain at the price

My experience/comments : I'm not a massage aficioniado but I had heard good things about this place so I went in one afternoon.

King St is a busy place so naturally a smart bloke like me enters through the front door. I only found out afterwards that there's a rear lane entrance. Note, this place does try to pass itself off as a legitimate massage centre but who are they kidding?

Upon entering, I was quoted prices and had Joy thrust upon me. I was told that there were no other ladies at the time. I was pretty toey by this stage and unlikely to back out.

I like women of all types but each time I go out on the punt I generally look for a particular type. That afternoon I was looking for somebody petite, slim, with a tiny waist and Joy definitely fit the bill. She was about 5'1 tall and she had a pleasant face, though nothing to write home about. 

The massage was the usual going through the motions stuff I've come to expect. Joy's English was very poor and it was difficult to explain to her what I wanted. After she finished the cursory massage, she had no problem intimating to me that it was now time for the wristy. Ok, I thought, but I want to see you without your clothes on. She said that for $30 more she would take it all off and I could touch her, as long as my fingers didn't stray inside. I paid up because what's the use of wanting a petite girl if you can't see her petite body?

Her body was slim as I expected but not toned, just a naturally thin girl who probably never works out. Breasts were a nice handful on her small frame and she was unshaven down below. She got me off and then I got dressed alone.

There are better girls at this joint but, at the price, I can't complain.

My experience/comments : Didnt get as choice as Amy was the only one available when i arrived.  Massage was surprisingly ok for this place.  Seemed to have a bit of method to her technique and says she worked in a beauty salon before so prob why she knows how to massage a bit.  Still lying face down, she finished up on the legs and then began the 'soft' massage and teased the tackle and butt.  This went on for a few minutes before turning over for a nice slow HJ.  She didnt rush through it like some girls but didnt seem that into it either and takes it as just her job.  Had a quick head massage afterwards as well to finish up.  Looks a bit old compared to other girls at this place but still enjoyed my time.

G’day ladies and gentlemen,


This is a review of Dianna.

It is hard to review her as I have mixed feelings about the experience.

Let me start by observing that often in life we typically divide the world, or
 our experience of, it in half.  Examples of this include day vs. night, black vs. white, right vs. wrong etc
We do this psychologically too. You know, this happens when we say “Is the glass half empty or half full?” As for me, I tend to be a half full guy, but that doesn’t make this review any easier.

 As a matter of fact, I think there are two types of people in the world. There are those who feel there are two types of people in the world and those that don’t.  I do.
Now to Dianna. Dianna is a lovely lady in her mid to late 20’s. She has lovely skin, pert b-cups and a warm smile with a sweet voice and nice lips. She is pleasant and friendly and is gentle. Treat her well and in all likelihood extras will be available. She does a good tug. Sound good so far?
 You’ve decided you want to see her? But wait, there’s more.

I love rub and tugs. If I am tense I can feel the stress and strain evaporate under the skillful hands of a beautiful women and I love it. The bonus is when she gently strokes my body with her finger tips. She runs her finger gently along my butt crack and reaches underneath to gently fondly the little fellow. This folks is sheer bliss and is NOT something you get in a full service joint.

Well, the above gentle stroking is where Diana started. There was no massage! From my observation she knows absolutely nothing about how to massage and makes little, if any attempt to fake it. So, for all practical purposes I got a tug with no real rub. This is a first form me as typically most rnt ladies ‘act’ like they know what they are doing even when they don’t.

So, here’s the crazy part, if you simply want a tug, book Diana for 30 minutes. If you want a rub and tug, go elsewhere and see another massage lady here like CiCi. A half hour in a full service place will give you more if you are after the sexy bits and not set you back much more in cost.

Looks: 7/10
Voice: 9/10. Very cute and sweet voice.
Attitude: 8/10
Tug :6/10
Massage: 0/10. Therereally wasn’t one. It was more like feather dusting.

So there you have it. In this case the glass was half empty.

Jack

Person's Name : Eva

Establishment : Newtown Massage Therapy Centre - Sh 3/501 King St, Newtown - 02 9557 1830

Date of Visit : 30/1/2012

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business :  To about 10pm

Rates : 50 1 hour 20 HJ 30 NHJ

Age : I think early 30s

Size/shape : Little and thin

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : See below

Value for money/recommend? : Yes!

My experience/comments : Eva was a great massage and sexual experience (one of tbe best I have ever had). She is small and very thin but cut wearing a nice short dress. Very pencil thin body with small nubs as breasts. She was born in Shanghai but worked for at least 3 years in Japan studying Japanese then worked as a Japanese interpreter for a company over there. She is very Japanese in her mannerism being incredibly polite and pleasant throughout the massage
Firstly Eva gave a great massage which was hard or medium working away all my tensions. During the massage she allowed me to touch her legs and things making me pretty excited! The mssage started at the head onto my back then my legs brushing the perineal area on the way!
At the 30 minute mark Eva jumped onto the massage table, between my legs while I was still on my belly. She asked me how pleasurable the massage had been I said very pleasurable and she said, I will now make is more pleasurable. At this point she started on of the most sexy soft massages I have ever experienced touching across my legs, thighs, buttocks and nether regions. As you can imagine I was rock hard from this point on…..then things go really interesting….
Eva turned me over…. With her very pretty short dress on she started to massage my tummy, abdomen and nipples. She then jumped on me dress and all and started to tongue kiss me rubbing her body all over mine from my groin to my face. At this point I was touching her all over feeling her through her panties with her dress riding high…she took over her dress and (very sexy) bra and gave me one hell of a body to body massage while I played with her through her very frilly panties. She asked whether I would like this off and I said yes…I was very hot and bothered by this point in time. She was rubbing/kissing and massaging her very wiry body into my cock. She bent up and let me finger her beautiful little vag and anal area. Clearly FS was not on the agenda but during this the HJ commenced while I fingered her to wetness…and I came. We tongue kissed some more then staying nude gave me a wonderful head massage while I calmed down….
She was I think expecting 30 but given what she did…I’m sorry…I gave 50…It was just so wonderful.

Age : I think early 30s

Size/shape : Average with smaller breasts and small tummy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Value for money/recommend? : Probably not

My experience/comments : Decided to try and new Sasa. She wore glasses was cute but despite learning English in Australia apparently for a year her English was pretty poor. Started the massage and within 10 minutes I was a little excited. She asked about HJ and nude (wanted 50 dollars) and then added BJ for the same price when I suggested 30. I said okay. She got out of her clothes and gave a pretty lame body to body. She then stuck a condom on me and gave me a really hard suck but nothing that really excited me and I did not finish. She decided on another body to body (again not that good) then gave me one very prolong…finally she got me over the line. After that she gave me an okay massage including walking one my back (which was nice), I became erect again which she studiously ignored. Sasa does not seem that smart and I do not think I would see her again

I saw Sasa a month or two ago.

i agree her service is not very good and she overprices herself.

The 'old' Sasa here was a real knockout with a great massage and hj. Her sister Jo-Jo still works at the sister shop in Liverpool and is great.

As far as the 'new' Sasa is concerned I'll be giving her a miss in the future.

My experience/comments : I booked Angela today. Very skinny lady in a sexy short dress. Her English is quite poor. After a very medium-soft and adequate massage for about 20 minutes with some leg touching on my behalf…. Angela whispered that she would take off clothes for 30. I agreed and she did. After a pretty good inspection of my cock and I of her fanny she offered a BJ for 50. I said FS? She said “next time” She jumped on top of me rubbing her body all over me. This made me pretty horny. She started grinding her fanny into my cock to the point where I thought we would have FS, instead she reached behind her and grabbed the moisturiser and started massage my cock with her hands, arse and fanny…very enjoyable. I came all over her belly.  We were at the 40 minute mark so she commenced the usual head massage. I started to massage her back and arse, felt her fanny again..there was a little wetness. She jumped up on my belly giving me full view and access….I was getting horny again…but alas time was up..a great experience and again worth the extra 50 bucks

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

Services Provided : HJ only

Value for money/recommend? : Probably not

My experience/comments : I was told Coco was Japanese which is unusual for this establishment. Coco had great English skills. She was from Osaka and had trained as a dental hygienist. She had tried to do the same in Australia but found the English component too difficult. She is currently completing her English qualification and working also as a dental assistant. She only worked 2 days a week as a masseuse. She was very thin and attractive with very tiny breasts. She wore long trousers suggesting that significant extras were not on the agenda with Coco. Indeed this was the case. Coco gave a pleasant medium soft massage but the HJ was..well..I did wonder whether she was trying to pull my cock right off! Touching is really not something Coco likes
To summarise, Coco is a lovely lady BUT she does not I think really enjoys her work at 501 and I would be surprised if she stays long. I would love to have a another chat and maybe a coffee with Coco…but probably not another massage

I had a similar experience with Coco, the only useful addition being that she told she used to work at a similar massage joint up in Crows Nest but found it too slow, i.e. not enough customers.  She said she would rather work at a legit massage shop, but the $ isn't as good.  Moral of the story, she's not passionate about her work in the least.  

That said, she seemed delighted at the $20 tip I gave her after my 30 min massage.  Is tip expected at this place for a 30 min?  The last couple of girls have seemed surprised but I thought it was mandatory.  I don't want to be over-tipping and screwing it up for the rest of you!

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Neutral

My experience/comments :
Basically, as I got cut by Chinese massage places like 447 and the one in Botany road, Alexandria. I refused to return to Chinese shops again. 
Do not call me a racist. I am actually Chinese.

A wednesday noon I walked into 501 opting for a massage because my back felt like one. Sophie is a busty girl but unfortunately you can also see her little tummy which is not my liking. 
In a way, it is good because it will save me money by without the need of getting extra from her.

Sophie massage is ok. I admire her professional attitude towards her work. Even I do not opt for the extra she provided, she is still smiling and get the job done.
Chinese style HJ is the one which the ML will stare at the cock and make no eye contact to you.

She is the better Chinese ML I have seen.

Unfortunately she couldn't concentrate and was distracted.
This was a little offputting and I only took the HJ on offer. She didn't allow any touching over the clothes.

Massage was firm and good, however HJ was ordinary and I had to concentrate to get over the line.

 My experience/comments :

I have seen Maggie before and since she has lost a couple of kgs. She is quiet and from what I experienced has a good attitude.
I didn't ask for nude as I forgot to withdraw money.

She has a reasonable bust and will definately ask for nude next time. She did an above average massage too and managed to get some knots out of my back.
Writing this review makes me want to go back again..

Slim and sexy looking and with her looks I was not expecting too much on the massage and there comes the surprise. One of the best massage I have in Sydney. If you like hard massage, you will love her. Then there was the HJ which she did as part of the oil massage, fantastic. At the end I was so happy that I give her a tip even HJ is suppose to be included.

My experience/comments :

Visited the sister shop to this one- 532 King St right across the road from 501. Saw Linda- very cute 20 something girl with a sweet personality. Her english was basic but between her english and my basic mandarin we managed a decent conversation.

Her massage was reasonably good. I've seen earlier reports of this girl being inexperienced so I think she has come a long way in the massage department. Anyway at the end of the massage I asked about nude for the finish and Linda agreed.

Very nice firm C Cup breasts and a nice unrushed tug. Really like this girl she tries hard to give good service. Will definitely be back for a repeat visit.

All up $50 for the hour massage and tipped $30 for the nude tug.

Walked up without a booking and Michelle was free.  Had read about her somewhere else so was happy i was assigned her.  She speaks minimal english so there was not much talk during the hour.  Massage was average with no hint of teasing but on turn over, she just starts handling the package, no questions asked.  Will try someone else but ok for a cheap release.

I agree with everything Dadakigo has said about Coco.  Very chatty and nice person but massage was average.  HJ was quite firm and continues to milk it after blowing which isnt good for me since im sensitive right after.  Didnt push for extras which was nice but have heard that she does do nude.  She was still there in June when I saw Michelle.

Dropped in without booking and got Rita.  Quite a cute looking girl with a decent body.  Again with this place, massage was nothing special.  Pushed for extras and opted for nude HJ.  Started out at $50 from her but got her down to the usual $30 for this place.  She didnt seem to happy about that and started complaining about how other places charge more.  Said she was looking for another shop to work at for that reason.  Enquired about FS and said it was $100 but didnt go for it.
She's now at Snow Lotus - 741 George St still as Rita but would try others first before going back to her but still ok for a cheap release.

My experience/comments: Went here for a massage today, was offered Eva. We didn't talk much for the first 45mins as I was really flatted out from work so I really wanted to relax and enjoy a good massage. Eva was not bad and she also asked if the pressure was ok to make sure I enjoyed. After wiped off the oil she whispered if I want more relax massage and she can do B2B, sure I said. To be honest, since Eva is such skinny girl with probably A cup, the B2B wasn't that great, however after turning over and starting the HJ, it was like Wow... I normally like it to be done in a slow and soft way, and Eva was doing excatly that, no rush, just excellent two hands technique slowing build up the climax. Her HJ is highly recommended!

Amy, 3/501 King Street

Services: erotic massage, HJ
Contact Details/Address/Weblink : (02) 9587 1830
I dropped in on Monday 14th May without a booking, and was given Amy. Not a young one, but good looking for whatever her age was, so I extended to an hour immediately.
Amy is a doctor of Chinese medicine from China. Once I indicated that I wanted a soft massage, she started off with a very sensual, fingertips-only massage. She has very tight legs, a pleasure to touch, and had no issues with my moving my hand higher. Eventually, for an extra $50, she stripped and I could touch her all over. 
I did not go for any DATY, but a little close-mouthed kissing seemed OK once she was aroused. You will notice, when her clothes come off, that her breasts are a little droopy (but not old hag breasts, don't worry), yet quite suckable. She seemes to like that. In fact, it was the breasts that first suggested to me that she is probably in her mid to late 30s.
Overall, a pleasant experience. I would see her again.

Age : Mid 20's

Size/shape : Average with a bit of a belly and no breasts

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, B2B, Nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Possibly

My experience/comments: I saw Grace. Grace has been in Australia about 4 years and working at this establishment for about 2 months. She is learning to be patisserie chef. Her English was very basic. She is pretty with great legs, very small breasts with large nipples. She has a little bit of a tummy. Grace started with a pretty good moderately hard massage, through the towel then a just as good oil massage of the body, she allowed some touching over her legs but not much.

She offered a body to body massage for 50 dollars which I took her up on. She whipped off her very pretty dress leaving her underwear on. She jumped onto me very enthusiastically rubbing her body up and down mine grinding her little breasts and large nipples into my chest and face. She allowed nipple sucking and side face kissing but no DFK. She started to rub what was a now very hard cock but did lack some technique. We both got pretty hot and bothered. In order to improve things, Grace squirmed around on my body making her head face my cock with her pussy and arse facing me. She gave me an excellent view allowing me to stretch things out with my hands but she asked me not to insert or touch too heavily which I completed respected her request (this took some self control!)

She went to work with her body on my cock giving some tit fucking (well it could have been any part of her body really given the lack of breast tissue!) and rubbing her body all over my cock but avoiding using her lips. She used her hands but not well however given the wonderful view of her relatively hairy pussy and all her squirming I did finally explode…I had not cum for a while so there was quite a lot covering bits of her face as well as a significant portion of the massage table. That made Grace yelp a little bit which make her push me off the table (gently) looking for things to clean the mess up!
So, in summary, Grace has a cute face great legs, not such a great middle, she has a great attitude but some issues with technique.

We didn't converse much but she gave an alright massage. She tried hard enough and I appreciated her efforts. She wasn't wearing clothing that was all that revealing but once we hit Part 2, I asked for nude and she agreed provided that I don't touch down below and suck her tits. She was quite busty which I didn't expect. I would have loved to suck those puppies but abided by those rules. HJ was average but managed to get me across the line. I'm sure she will improve as time goes by.

Her massage was alright with a decent amount of force and she focused on the tense areas quite well. She didn't use oil so I can imagine it being better.

She was slightly larger probably Size 8/10 and she gave a decent HJ. She got me over the line and I went off to do my errand. She did offer Nude but I didn't go for it.

G’day all,

“ Movies are like life with all the boring bits taken out.”
                                           Samuel Goldwyn 

This is a review of Linda.

You know Goldwyn was right. Movies take all the boring bits out. You never see a guy spending an hour finding a parking space. In the movies they always get a space in front of where they are going. In movies you don’t usually even see people pay for things like cab fare or meals. In fact in movies you don’t usually see people take a piss or eat. Those are the boring bits left out.

If you use a thesaurus for boring you get things like:

Uninteresting
Tedious
Dull
Dreary
Lackluster 
Mind-numbing
(As a footnote let me add the word interesting here too!)

Folks, the above describes the bulk of Jack Kerouac’s life. For example, take my crush on Claudia Kataganagai. She was a real beauty, nice girl and actually agreed to go out with me twice to the movies, but at the end of the second date the following conversation ensued:

Jack: They are showing Pillow Talk with Hudson and Day at the Orpheum.
Claudia: Jack I need to tell you something.
Jack: What?
Claudia: I don’t think we should see each other anymore.
Jack: Why?
Claudia; Well Jack, you’re very interesting but. . . 
Jack: What?
Claudia: You were so funny at school, but now you’re . . .
Jack: Interesting. I can be funny. I can learn new jokes and material.
Claudia: It’s not happening for me Jack.
Jack: Yeah, I am interesting.

Folks, with a woman being interesting is the kiss of death for a relationship. The fact that it is interesting that certain paints dry in 3 hours is hardly an incentive to sit and watch it happen!  For Claudia it was goodbye Kerouac and hello Vaughn Camera.

This brings us to 501 King Street and Linda.

I have not been to this establishment since mamasan Miko went to China some four months ago. Ah Miko, what a woman. If only she would notice my love for her from afar. She looked hot to me today and . . .I am getting off topic, but I would sell my mother to the slave trade for her.

Anyway, or ‘anyways’ if you were educated at Harvard or Oxford, I was given the only lady available and that was Linda.

Linda said she was 23 and appeared to be so. She is about 5 feet, two inches in the old parlance and weight for height appropriate. She has an innocent, girl next door thing going on with her, b-cups with pert nipples and a cute voice.

The experience was boring. Her massage skills were adequate I guess, but there just wasn’t anything to it. While laying on the table my mind started to wander and I wondered if I had taken my blood pressure medication or not. I remembered the time in 10th grade when I was  the catcher in a school baseball game and Gleopfus Cloueey was batting and the bat flew from his hands and knocked two of my teeth out.

I snapped back into reality when she did a pretty good butt massage, but the boredom continued. We had some chit chat, but even that wore thin.

At roll over time she asked me if I wanted a handjob and I agreed this could be nice. It wasn’t. Linda seemed to think an erection meant the cock remained horizontal instead of assuming a vertical position. I paid for the extra of her taking her top off BUT “No suck and no touch nipples!”

I came and have contacted The Guinness Book of Records to include me in the category of ‘Least Sexual Orgasm from Most Lackluster Hand-job’ category.

Well, it WAS boring and we finished 45 minutes into my hour session I didn’t and don’t care.

. To top it all off I gave my nephew Efrem Zimbalist Farquar the wrong address for 501’s sister rnt shop in Liverpool. He went into a full service joint and tried to get an hour for $50. Boy, was he pissed off with me!

Toward the end of his telling me off the following conversation ensued:

Farquar: You know Uncle Jack they should make a movie of your life.
Jack: You know, at my age if they want me to see it they better make it quick!

On the way out of the shop I spotted a girl that Miko told me was Susan. She wore a silver top and hot pants and looked like she was heading for the disco and had extras written all over her.

If this punt was a movie and I removed the boring bits it would read:

This is a review of Linda.

Until later ya’ll.

Jack

It is correct $50 include HJ and that is why people call Michelle bargain cos for $30/$50 handjob included with a young hotty is almost non exists in the market .

Having said that if a girl did a good job in the message, it doesn't hurt to tip them 10 bucks just to keep them happy. I have to agree $25 is a bit too much

 Tina and Sandra Dee at 501 King Street
				
Post Content: 
Chinese Massage
501 King St.
Newtown
Phone: 02 95571830

G'day mates,

This is a review of Tina.

"But you've got the beauty of love on your side. And if we can find our sense of humour . . why these are the weapons of the angels."

These words were spoken by Richard Egan in the last scene in the movie A Summer Place.

To understand this punt you need to see me for the starry eyed romantic I truly am. I love the movie A Summer Place. Next time it's on TV have a look at it. Sandra Dee is one of the stars and no one has the eyes that she has. When her eyes get all moist in several scenes you can tell that it's the real deal and not some flunkie squirting glycerine drops into them! And Troy Donahue? If Lawrence Olivier could do the telephone scene like Donahue he would die a happy man knowing he was a great thespian. ( See  Sandra Dee in A Summer Place - YouTube  )

The movie is about love for those young who have never felt its full intensity before and also for those later in life who feel true love has abandoned them. Folks, I get all chocked up just thinking about it. Why, Dorothy McGuire who plays Troy Donahue's mum, is so lovely I would eat her pussy out live on the 6 O'clock News and not care what anybody thought! So there you have it. I believe in love and romance and yes, a bit of erotica thrown in as well.

Well, I didn't get anything like the above with Tina. Let me first do an overall evaluation of her.

GOOD NEWS:
Tina is very pretty.
Tina has lovely A-cups with great nipples.
Tina has a lovely body.
Tina has great English.
Tina is probably a good person.

BAD NEWS:

She shortened my hour booked to 35 min.
She asked too many personal questions.
Her massage did not recognise I had a body outside of my back.
Her back massage stank.

Ok, so what happened? Well, Casanova Farquar insisted we would to 501. As soon as Miko flipped over the 'Open' sign we barged into the joint. There were two ladies available. Farquar chose a cute beanpole named Eva and I was pleased to get very pretty Tina. Ladies and gents the rest from there went downhill and the romanticism that was A Summer Place was no more to be found.

Her massage was terrible and she talked and talked. After about 10 minutes she asked if I wanted 'special service'. Well, ladies and gents I was all over that idea like a flock of ducks on a June bug. For extra she took off her clothes while giving a handjob.

Before she started the handjob the following interaction occurred:

Tina: Can you still get your cock hard?
Kerouac: Yes. (I was feeling offended.) 
Tina: Really?
Kerouac: Yep if you're sexy and pretty.
Tina: I am pretty. All the customers tell me that.
Kerouac: How nice for you. Can I have your autograph?
Tina: What?
Kerouac: Yes you are pretty.

Tina then handled my cock as if it was a desert rattlesnake and it was only by thinking about Sandra Dee that I got over the finish line. She was even more inept than Manly was against the Storm and about has pleasurable as receiving a head high hit from  Anthony Watmouth.

She then dressed, so I took the cue and put my gear on too and waited for what seemed like an hour before Farquar finished with Eva.

After conferring with Farquar outside I discovered her went 5 min over time and I got diddled 25 min. I rang Miko and Miko said Tina told her I decided to finish early. A lie? Let's just say that not only was Tina not intimate with me she was also not close to the truth either.

Will I go back? Of course. It's worth going just to see Miko.

See Tina again? If you have to ask that question you're not reading this shit.

I shall return.

Jack

Mona is does one of the best in Newtown, there is also another lady call Vicky does very decent massage. Both of them wont disappoint you in part one.

She is very playfull when come to the sexy stuff. A plus is her english is quite good too so easy to communicate. She started like a little lamb but soon turn into a tiger in the jungle. Very friendly and fun.

Have to say her extra is a bit pricy in terms of Newtown standard, but again she is not the first one to ask that price, still way cheaper than most of the rip off places in city and up north.

My experience/comments : 

I just walked off the street today, initially Ada walked into the room…pretty sexy but I suspect not a great massager…she must have had another customer as yoyo then walked in. I booked Yoyo for one hour. She was wear a short skirt and nice clothes. She started a pretty lame massage and very quit. We started to chat and joke. She was apparently from Beijing studying or maybe have studied accounting in China. She was in Australia temporarily I think for make a little money to fund her education (so like nearly every other massage girl in Sydney) She thought I was pretty funny and continued to warm up which converted into a progressively better massage. She sat on my arse giving me a pretty good back massage which was probably the highlight of the hour. She turned me over and started a more sexy massage of my nipples she grabbed my cock and started to give a pretty half-hearted HJ very much at arm’s length. She allowed some panty touching. I paid her another 50 dollars and she got out of her clothes. She told me that she was concerned about some of the weight she had put on while living in Sydney (too many good cafés and restaurants in Newtown). Yoyo got more into the HJ and allowed much more particularly pussy touching…but not much else. She much of the time looking in the mirror critically appraising her body which …I tried to assure her looked pretty good!. She started to focus more on my cock and I got her a little closer to me and the action which helped get more there…nice chat at the end and hot towel

All in all..okay but I do not think Yoyo really is into her job as much as some MGs I have met…so maybe not see her again…I wish her well

My experience/comments : 

I went early as I had nothing else to do. Tiffany was available. She is pretty tall, lots of makeup and very beautiful wearing a cocktail dress. She had pretty good English. She was studying accounting at Macquarie University. She offered my hard or very hard massage. Her massage really just involves her feet (thank god she took off her high heels!!) Lots of stepping on my back (it was nice but seemed to go on a very longtime), then the legs. I was wondering whether a foot job maybe on the menu! She finally completed the foot side of things and gave me a massage with her hands, not much oil. Sort of odd massage but in the end pretty relaxing. Tiffany continued to chat and call me by my first name which was lovely…she then offered HJ and no clothes. She took off her sexy dress then her bra, she left her rather sexy panties on. She was a little mechanical in her manner…sort of like a wind up Chinese doll.  She complained about weight gain…but really…she is skinny with great B tits! He HJ  technique was soft but with me having good access to her body including her pussy…the tension did start to build…it got pretty intense and I came. There was still a good 10-15 minutes so she gave a little head massage along with a very hot towel
Tiffany is a really lovely , sexy girl with a banging body…and if I was a little younger..so I was happy… I handed over 40 extra dollars and went on my way

Tiffany told me I should come back and see her on a Sunday (which she works regularly) but alas I was travelling, she was working Friday when I saw her due to staffing shortage.

Person's Name : Rose (Newtown Massage binge part 1)

Establishment : 501/532 King St, Newtown - 02 9557 1830 / 02 9550 3822

Date of Visit : 13/12/12

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business : 10am-about 10pm

Rates : 30/50 for 30/60

Age : Hmmm maybe 18-22

Size/shape : Thin and pretty sexy looking with A cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Han Chinese

Services Provided : Massage...Only! 

Value for money/recommend? : Well..No...but it depends on your perspective (see below)

My experience/comments : 

I rang 501 King and ask who was available. The answer included Rose, “she  is new, very young and beautiful”.  So I said yes. I only had 30 minutes as I had an appointment. I entered the place. Rose was indeed young, dark skinned, cute and wearing some very short shorts. Okay, this could be good. I chatting to Rose, this was her second day. She had been in Australia sometime and was studying at Macquarie University ,maybe business?? I cannot recall. She was from the Xinjiang province which is home of the Uyghur (wiɡər) ethnic minority in China. They are Muslim and Rose did not like them as apparently one of them stole her bag when she was young. I got the feeling talking to Rose that the Han Chinese treated this minority similarly to how Romani people of Europe. During this chat Rose was massaging me very softly and it was quite a pathetic effort I though. Having said that, Rose was sexy, she stayed out of my way but let me touch her a little bit. She massaged between the thighs and got me pretty erect. Well, she went off to get hot towels and flipped me over.  She gave me another pretty half hearted massage, we talked a little bit about classical music, then without warning she said, “finished” thank you and walked out of the room! Well I was a little taken aback, I have been to this shop a lot and I have declined a tug on one occasion but never has no tug been offered. Well, was it worth it? Clearly on the surface you would have to say no, it was not as I do not think what services Rose provided would fit what would you expect from a “Rub (there was little) and Tug”. However, I paid only 30 dollars and Rose “massaged” me for over 45 minutes and haywainaving a very attractive you girl chatting and touching you for that amount of time for that price you could argue is a bargain! However, I did get offered Rose again with a similar tag line (“new young beautiful”) and I declined. Why no tug? Hard to say, she was new, she had gone overtime? I gave off bad vibes? I really could not tell. I would be interested if anyone else get to experience Rose. See part 2 under 447 King Street

Date of Visit : 14/12/12

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business : 10am-about 10pm

Rates : 30/50 for 30/60 minutes

Age : 

Size/shape : Getting older...

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage and nude body to body massage with handjob (extra 50), FS was offered 

Value for money/recommend? : Okay

My experience/comments : 

My third punt was back at the sister shop to 501 (528). I rang up and got the choice of NoNo or Rebecca. I opted for Rebecca.
Rebecca was a reasonably attractive woman of at least 30 I think. I paid for one hour and got undressed.  Rebecca dressed up well and looked quite attractive. She spent the first ½ hour giving me a pretty good massage, it made me feel pretty relaxed. Rebecca has been in Australia for about 5 years ex Hong Kong and Shanghai. She has one 6 year old child who lives with her. She has I think been working pretty fulltime massaging.  She realised that I was up to it and asked whether I would be interested in nude b2b. for 50. I said yes. She got out of her clothes, Her body is not that great. Rebecca has a tattoo on her lower stomach and has a bit of a tummy, she has quite big breasts which I suspect in their day would have been pretty amazing, they are started to sag just a little. Her pussy was pretty dam hairy Rebecca went to work on my cock rubbing it with great gusto. I had good access to her hairy pussy. We did this for a while when she lay next to me on the table and offered me full service for another 50. I declined so we just kept going at each  of our bodies. Given the size of her breasts I was quite keen on Spanish but I just could not quite manoeuvre myself into the right position and I got the feeling Rebecca was not into it. I finally came (having come the morning before-see part 2)

Rebecca got dressed and gave me a great chat and massage which to tell you the truth was the most fun of the encounter our discussion ranged from exercise, food, humour, music, children and relationships. All in all I felt good about the encounter but I would probably not do it a second time.

Services Provided : HJ included, touching(extra)

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

Went to newtown today and was expecting to have a session with Nono, but unfort, the girl went home early due to sickness, so I had to choose another girl.  Most girls at the shop were free when I came in the evening but it was only Vicky who stood out from the rest.  She was sitting down with a seductive look on her face and dangling her shoes so I thought why not give this girl a try.  She is about 165cm, with a dark tan, face not bad, nice legs, not super hot but is worth the price youre paying.  Did not ask for clothes off, but bust not big.

Massage was very impressive as this girl has quite a solid build (not ugly), so her motions were quite hard, which I quite liked.  She is worth the money just on the massage alone as she puts in a good effort.  I also got a foot stepping massage with towel on.  She was quiet smooth with the motions.

Then came the exciting part.  I asked to touch her without stripping and she wanted a tip, so we agreed on $10.  I got to feel her legs, bum, touched her pussy with clothes covered.  the girl is different to the rest as she would glance at me seductively.  Got over the line quite easily.  All in all great attitude.  Highly recommended.

Saw this post on the other forum:

"Good news for hard massage fans, listen up

Have a chat with a friend who has very good intel from Newtown, he told me that two former massage queen is returning:

1st is Lisa many Newtown regular will know her. mid age, not so pretty but her massage skills and services make up for it. I have not try myself but many customer still looking for her even she is now gone for almost 6 months. Not so sure when exactly she is returning though. Will keep you guys posted.

Lonely heart style and I leave the best last. Yoli is returning to NT 501 and Liverpool this week. My friend said she will be in Newtown Saturday and Liverpool on sunday.Quote my old post 

"Yesterday?? U must have run into yoly. Yeah she is cute, slim body and very good services. Oh her massage is really good too. I see another raising star in NT if she stay put."

In fact me and my mate both agree she is very likely provide the best massage of all time, follow closely by JoJo (gone), Carmen (gone), Amy (gone), Mona (Current) and Vicky (Current). The magic of Yoli is her part 2, without even you touching her or taking anything off, she can already give you a very good time. If you tried and like her service, please dont be stingy and reward her nicely, trust me you will be doing yourself and everyone else a big favour.

Call 9557 1830 for newtown and 9601 0710 for liverpool. for bookings. I am sure she will be all book up quickly after all her regulars find out that she has returned."

The person who wrote this is always on the mark, so wage to try out this Yoli. Will report afterwards.

Amanda was the only one available.  It was only her 2nd day there and she was very quiet.  Her massage wasnt as bad as some but not good either.  Didnt use any oil for the massage and used the towel to cover up.  The receptionist mentioned she was still shy.  Turned over and asked if i wanted a HJ.  Very inexperienced in this department as well and HJ was probably the worst i've had.  She's young and slim but her face isnt very special.
Wouldnt go back to see her again

The street view photos on google maps can be a couple of years old. I think the 532 shop is where that small shop selling kids clothing is in the google maps photo of 532 King St. Although the bump n grind may be a closer description of what occasionally goes on in the massage shop .

If you actually go to 532 King there's a prominent new sign advertising the fact that a massage business is there now.

Was a very quiet morning and chose Maggie who was the best looking and one of the younger girls in the shop.  Was wearing a nice tight skirt which looked hot.  Didnt talk very much but her english is ok, better than some that work there.  Massage not great and stays away from any "accidental" brushing even when working on the upper legs.  Before turning over, gives the balls and perenium a bit of a grope but didnt last long.  Turn over and goes back to massaging the legs before starting the happy ending.  Worked it nice and slow to a relaxing finish.
She's only been working for a few weeks and is only here until next weekend before she goes back to China for a holiday.  May not come back as Uni starts again after her holiday.
Will try to see here again before she leaves.

Attitude - Poor service, booked for 60 min but finished in 45 min and said my time was up. I was equally eager to get out !!!

 Vicky, Miko and Pissing in the Bushes
				
Post Content: 
Chinese Massage
Mine Host: Miko
501 King Street
Newtown
Phone: 9557 1830

Howdy Everyone,

This is a review of Vicky.

Today started out as an adventure to try out that Korean place in Narwee that specialises in bbj with cim. Well folks we waited for an hour and a half in the coffee shop almost next door and it was no soap. They did not open up. It was starting to get hot and the dye in my hair was beginning to melt into my eyes.

With me on this day was my nephew Efrem Zimbalist Farquar. Some of you have read comments I have made before about him. He's the only guy I know who will have a punt on his way to a punt and have another one on his way home. He is an animal.

I remember a few years ago, on a humid night, when he and my other nephew Edd 'Kookie' Byrnes met up in a hotel in Burwood. Kookie, as was his habit, started talking to two Thai women. Both clearly had drinking and mental health issues, (i.e. they were alcoholics and were crazier then shit), and the long and short of it is that Farquar decided to drive the three of them back to their place where presumably Kookie would share the night with the younger one. For the sake of argument let's just call her Rambo. Anyway, I had a few turps under my belt and started walking home. Along Burwood Road I suddenly encountered Farquar who announced he desperately had to pee. The following conversation ensued:

Farquar: If I don't find somewhere right now I'll piss my pants.
Kerouac: Go ahead. I don't care.
Farquar; Do you think I could pee behind those bushes? ('Those bushes' were about 32 cm tall!)
Kerouac: Sure. Why not?
Farquar: (Unloading 3 litres of piss.) Now I feel good.
Kerouac: Why, because half of the free world saw your pathetic dong?

I later found out that when Kookie arrived at the girls place Rambo said she'd have sex with him, but she didn't have any condoms. Kookie quickly ran to the local 7/11 and paid an arm and a leg for the doms. When he returned Rambo had switched all the lights out and no one answered the door. A forlorn Kookie took the packet of condoms and slipped them into their post box. It took him over an hour to walk home from their place. Ah, unrequited love is a sad thing.

Sorry I have digressed.

Well, Farquar and I decided we would go to 501 King Street Newtown. I called Miko the mamasan and she told me she had some new girls there and it didn't matter as I hadn't seen any of them anyway.

When we arrived I thought my bladder would bust, As soon as we opened the door to 501 I made a bee line for the john. While I was eliminating 3 gallons of amber, (that's more than 3 litres), Farquar selected a girl named Amanda and disappeared into one of the rooms.

The remaining girl was Vicky. She looked ok, but was nothing particularly special until . . .

Let me tell you a strange thing about Vicky. Outside the room she looked fairly ordinary but on close-up inspection I thought she was a hottie. She said she was studying English and had been for several months. Based on my conversation with her it seemed more like seven minutes! Folks, you won't be discussing epistemology, cosmology or post modern architecture with this one.

She said she is 24 and that could be right. She had B+/C- cups and flawless skin. She knows how to massage and ladies and gents her fingers felt like steel wrenches screwing my back muscles in and out of shape. There was often a little tackle tickle and she massaged from head to toe literally. At turn over time she gave a respectable you know what and extras may be for a gentleman who is a 'gentle man.

When I finished I waited and talked with Miko until Farquar was done. Some Asian guy came in and cuddled Miko and that pissed me off because I wanted to. 

As I said before: Ah, unrequited love is a sad thing.

I need to go and rinse the hair dye out of my eyes, or is it tears from never hugging Miko.

See you all again soon.

Until that time friends . . . until that time.

Jack

Figure: slim, say size 6 (breasts feel B-ish, cant get her clothes off)
From: MLC
Location: Shop 3/501 King Street Newtown
Cost: $50/60m+tip
Would I return: to see her, probably not.

Today I visited 501 one more time. I saw Rose. What can I say? Rose does not know how to massage, nor is she particularly erotic. However her HJ is quite competent. Rose is basically a young, innocent girl who's not interested in you doing too much to her. I could not get any of her clothes off, but I did manage to fondle her between her legs through her panties a little. She said it felt 'different'. I'm not sure I'm going to go back. This girl seems like too much work. She's young, slim, good looking but just too much work.

My experience/comments :  

Had heard there was a new girl at this shop so called and made a booking. Emily is a HK girl about 160cm medium build with C/D Cup boobs. Booked for an hour and Emily greeted me with a cute smile disappeared with the $50 while I got undressed. Massage was quite good, not super strong but ok- loosened up my shoulders a bit. At the half way point Emily asked me to turn over. At this point I was a bit worried that she was going to be a time stealer. I was happy to find out this was not the case, after wiping off the oil I asked Emily about extras and she agreed to nude.

Turns out she was merely allowing enough time for the play part. What followed was a nice slow tease and an unhurried HJ with a bit of nipple kissing. After the HJ the time was filled with more massage. Can recommend Emily she is service oriented and should show you a good time. At this shop you can usually tip $30 for nude but I enjoyed the service and tipped $40 this time.

Value for money/recommend? : For the chat and massage..yes HJ probably not

My experience/comments : Well, I would like to say that Icy is a really lovely lady, she is smart and chatty. I actually saw her at the sister shop opposite (sorry for using the wrong thread). I booked for 2pm but she was running late, having lunch, when Icy came in she told me she could only handle water for lung...she told me she had been on a bit of a bender the night before. 

She is from Beijing... she asked me whether I had been there (yes I had) she told me about how her dad visited a number of large massage parlours in Beijing with numbered ladys, and she could sort of understand after being married to her mum (and anybody) for 30 years...just don't tell her! Icy proceeded to cover me in blankets and give me a pretty good massage (I felt a little like I was in a burka there was so many blankets!) Well we continued to chat, she was not impressed by the advances of a lesbian in a pub she frequented, we talked about KTV and the fact there are a number of venues with similar pricing structures in Sydney that were similar to China......chat... chat ...chat. She made me laugh a lot...she is studying business at Sydney Uni and is not doing so well in international law....well she flipped me over and offered a HJ for free...she clearly did not enjoy it.....it was not the best part of the experience for me either as a result but she is lovely...She offered no extra cost but clearly I gave her a tip...really nice lady...If I was younger I could spend the rest of my life with a lady like her...she may need to address the alcohol issue though....

Value for money/recommend? : Not really

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)
On this day I had actually intended on visiting the sister shop across the road. I walked into that shop and was greeted by a fairly curvaceous woman. I smiled and feigned I was just information gathering and wasnt actually looking to punt that day. 
I then crossed the road hoping for a different ML. As I was entering the male, who I guess runs the place, started smiling and saying it must be my first time because he had never seen me before. Telling me I had come at a good time and that he had a very good looking girl for me. I had heard about Rose, and her potentially starfish or nonchalant performance. However, when I saw her I thought maybe I would be the lucky punter that got a wholy different experience!

Well we get in the room and she is in a slinky pink dress. I get on the table and she comes in the room and did a "round" of the table with her fingernails dragging slowly across my body and even across my crack. At this point I was thinking I was in for a treat, because up until this point a maneuver as mentioned had only been performed by MLs who had subsequently gone on to offer a very erotic and sensual massage.

She then began her massage which was a little lacklustre. Again I rationalised it didnt matter, because I was here for the second half. Well this massage was really painful (mentally) to endure. It was so ??? I don't even know the words to describe it. It wasn't like she was prodding, it was more just it wasn't relaxing at all...

Anyway I thought I would try and move things along towards the fun part, so my hands started to stroke her legs. She then asked whether I wanted her to strip down which I affirmed. However, that was about it. She wouldn't let me touch anywhere apart from her legs, stomach and arms. Her HJ was very mechanical. In the end I didn't shoot, and I just left when the hour was up. Disappointing, but perhaps Rose really is the dud out of the lot.

Came back here after a long time away. Neither the Mamasan nor Papasan were there - instead a chubby Chinese girl. I didn't ask for anyone in particular, so Eva was my first cab off the rank.

Took her for half an hour but, after a bit of conversation and touching her thighs, I decided to extend. Eventually she asked me if I wanted clothes off, and I said yes. She did not negotiate a price, just went for it. However, she seemed really nice with the B2B, and allowed me to suck her nipples. I decided not to try (nor even attempt) DATY - am staying away from unsafe stuff - so cannot comment on that.

The massage was great, as was the B2B. In fact, the HJ was so good that I had to slow her down a few times, so that I could last longer.

Only downside for me was the fact that, no matter how much I touched her, I could not manage to get her wet down there.
Nonetheless, if she didn't enjoy her time with me, then she faked it quite well. Lots of smiles and very friendly - just couldn't maintain eye contact for very long, she would break it off - shy perhaps?

I highly recommend her.

Eva only works Mondays here. She said she does one day across the road (sorry can't remember it) and a day or two at the Liverpool shop (which I have never visited).

Date of Visit : Friday 12th April

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business : 

Rates : $50 +extras

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : slimmish, b cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage, HJ, GFE...sort of

Value for money/recommend? : meh! 

My experience/comments : Vicky was competent, sort of pretty (she grew on me) with a nice figure. Not a lot of personality. Massage was good. When it was time for roll over we negotiated nude. She strips off then she lies down next to me and proceeds to give me a very unenthusiastic and lazy HJ (more of a squeeze) and a lame GFE. I finally got over the line...but only just.

And that's when I decided that I don't like the GFE at all. Her version of it was more like a "we've been together for 5 years already" GFE. She seemed over it and just going through the motions. I didn't like it because I'm there to pay for a service. If I wanted a GFE I'd look elsewhere, where I would actually establish a relationship and make a connection with someone. You don't make much of a connection in an hour, especially when that someone hardly speaks English. So let's cut the bullshit, give me a decent HJ and out the door I'll go. I know others will disagree with this view, I'm just saying, that's all.

Jenny was the new girl, just one month in Australia, living out Parramatta way. So new I was her first customer. She was 

sweet and lovely. Tall and statuesque, probably a size C wearing shorts over stockings. She gives a good massage with very 

limited touching. Her HJ technique was to say the least rigorous but effective. You do get the feeling that some (and 

actually I think most) girls really do not like this work, I suspect Jenny will be one of them and I would be surprised if 

she last long in her new job..but you never know she may grow into it. I wish her well

Date of Visit : 14/04/2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business : 10am - ?

Rates : $30 half hour/ $50 hour + tips

Age : early 20s

Size/shape : Slim, busty

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RNT

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

I've reviewed this young lady before, and as she has become a semi regular in the year since my last review I thought it might be time for an update. I've seen her maybe 5 or 6 times in the past year to give you an idea.

I rang ahead to book an hour massage and on arrival Linda greets me with a smile and shows me in. Linda's massage for a young girl is quite good. The only thing is I don't think she can do a strong massage- she never asks and what is delivered is a competent but medium strength massage at best. Expect to be relaxed rather than 'loosened'. 

My experiences with Linda remind me of the old adage 'your mileage may vary'. If you hit it off with the girl that can lead to a better experience.  As a customer I am fairly conservative, I'm happy to just do RNT and if the girl strips I usually just go for external touching. This seems to sit well with Linda as far as I know from reading other reports on her she is fairly shy and limited with extras. Also her english isn't great but we get by talking in a mix of english and chinese. She doesn't mind a joke and despite the language limitations our conversations are fun.

For me Linda delivers consistent service which has steadily improved since I first started seeing her. Her breasts are c cup, firm and her body is beautiful. Combined with cute girl next door looks and attitude I leave the shop feeling relaxed and happy.

Recommended for a good relaxing time but I think extras are limited to nude and limited touching. Go easy on her and she will respond accordingly.

 Emily's Lips and little else
				
Post Content: 
G'day folks,

Newtown Chinese Massage 
501 King Street
Newtown
Phone: 9557 1830

This is a review of Emily.

I must say that this joint has gone downhill since I was last here about 6 months ago. As has been pointed out, long gone are the days with great ladies and service such as Daisy, JoJo, Nana, SaSa and even little Annie. Yep, those days are over and the place may never return to its former glory.

Things are even worse when Miko is not around. She runs a tight ship and she was not here today. It appears she works a bit in Liverpool now.

So, when I arrived I was confronted by a relatively young, ok English speaking chubbster. She had all the customer service of a brick and I am sure was voted by her graduating class at high school 'Girl Most Likely to Achieve Total Anonymity'. In this regard she has been successful.

I asked who was available and she led me to a massage room and said 'I will show you". What she showed me was one Ml and her name was Emily. Don't get me wrong, she looked hot and I wasn't about to knock her back. I paid my $50 for the hour and undressed while she went to get my change. When she returned she gave my butt and sensual swipe and I thought "Oh boy Jack, you've fallen into a good setup here". I hadn't.

Life consists of both positive and negatives and such was the case in this scenario.

Good:

Says she is 22 and looks it.
Very pretty face.
Kissable lips that I kissed.
Nice body with firm B+/C- cups.

Bad:

Knows absolutely nothing at all about a massage.
Tried to charge me $50 extra for a handjob!!
Didn't even wipe my carcass with hot towels at the end.
Limited extras and expensive.
Trimmed my 60 min to 45.

The massage was hopeless. Her hands felt like sandpaper and she used so little oil I thought there must have been a strike at the oil factory and supplies had dried up. (Sorry, bad metaphor as water, not oil, dries up.)

She spent 80% of the time on my neck and if it wasn't a problem before she got her mitts on it, it is probably trouble for me now. At one stage she said "I don't know how to massage" and said this will all the conviction of someone revealing the code for the Rosetta Stone. I am thinking "The good news I it can't get any worse."

BUT

At rollover time the following conversation ensued:

Emily" Handjob?
Jack: Sure.
Emily: $50.
Jack: I will have to talk to my nephew Farquar.
Emily: Why?
Jack" Because if he agrees with that price I'll get a new nephew.

Anyway, or anyways if you're a Philistine, I negotiated a nude hj.

She is a looker folks, but it's all packaging and little satisfaction. I did enjoy kissing her lips, but I could and should have done the handjob myself.

She left the room and I thought it was to get hot towels, but I heard the toilet flush and it appears her break was merely to pee-pee. When she returned she announced the time was up.

Oh well, that's the way it goes folks. Today is just one of those days in the life of Kerouac. I bought one of those jumbo Allen's Party Mix bags and I swear there is no mix, but a bunch of those banana shaped things that I hate.

BUT

The contents of the Party Mix is an appropriate element in living and writing on this punt.

Will I see sweet lips Emily again.

Duh! No.

I shall return friends,

Until that time . . .until that time.

Jack

Howdy Gang,

This is a review of Vicky.

Let me sort of start at the end of the story to just get over the stupid bits and get down to brass tacks.

Today was cool, but hardly freezing. Miko had the heater up full bore and folks it felt like the middle of the Sahara Desert in there. As Vicky applied the oil I felt and smelled like I was being groomed as the Beijing duck dish at some rich Chinese guy’s bar mitzvah Not a pretty picture folks and even Vicky had to remove some of her layers of clothes so she didn’t pass out from heat stroke.

Next, when Vicky went to get the towels the door was open and Kerouac was laying on his back with his wee-wee bobbing up and down in the steam room conditions. I looked up to see an Aussie bloke looking at me and the following conversation ensued:

Kerouac: What are you looking at buddy?
Aussie bloke: I don’t know.
Kerouac: If you don’t then you need to get out of the house more often.
Aussie bloke: What?
Kerouac: I mean “Piss off!”

He left and right at the end of my time here there was anr Asian gentleman who seemed to be trying to chat up Miko and the following interaction occurred:

Kerouac: You know, Dave is opening a massage parlour in San Francisco.
Asian gentleman: Really? (It was a ‘really’ that was wondering “Is this REALLY true?”)

Well, while there I had the chance to see little Doris and she was cute, but seemed sort of a plain Jane to me and I wondered if she had the elbow grease to do a real heavy duty massage.

'Anyway' if you were educated at Cambridge, or 'Anyways' if you went to Harvard, I liked Vicky’s looks. As a matter of fact, the closer I got to her the hotter I thought she was. 

Like I mentioned earlier, she peeled off some of her clothes after we entered the furnace to reveal a lovely body that was weight for height. She has full, thick lips which I like in a woman and her English was up to the task. Said she was 24 and that could be accurate.

I can understand why some would see her as mechanical where I thought she was systematic. She massaged everywhere. She does a good hand and foot massage and I love that as most ML’s ignore those parts of the anatomy. She has very strong fingers and I am sure she could interlace them with bad guys and bust there fingers with hers. Gents and ladies she does the best butt massage I have ever had. She spreads the cheeks and massages around the butt hole and friends it is a sight to behold.

Like most people, if you treat them with courtesy and respect, they respond well. Extras were available and were enjoyed, but the details will remain a secret. Let me just say that I will return and see Vicky, (She pronounces it ‘Wicky’) again.

As far as you and I are concerned I will return.

Until that time friends . . . until that time.

Jack

 Jenny at 501 King Street, Newtown
				
Post Content: 
Date of visit: 2013.06.16 (Sunday), around 8:10pm
Name: Jenny, 3/501 King Street
Age: MILF. Early 30s I think.
Works: Usually Mondays. Was filling in for someone today.
Figure: MILF. Slim. Undressed, figure OK, but little dried up tits. Sad sight. Lovely (pretty) face. Wirey hair (curtains AND carpet). Fully carpeted.
Nationality: MLC; Passable, English, has been here for less than two months.
Rates: $50/60 + $50 (originally wanted to tip her $30, she asked for more - I'm a softie).
Services: erotic massage, HJ
Contact Details/Address/Weblink : (02) 9587 1830
Recommended : Yes. She is nice. I feel there may be a sad story behind her, but she was smily, friendly and nice.


Just came in off the street. No tip upfront, just the $50/60. I nuded up and laid out.
Turns out she forgot to put down the little tissue blanket thing, so got up while she did that.
Massage was ok, mainly the pressure sort. I fondled her to the extend I cut given her short, but loose, cut-off shorts.
After about 30m, after I had done some fondling and she had done some tackle tickle, she asked I wanted her nude. What the heck, I went for it. Her figure looked ok.
I was somewhat distressed when I saw her tits, they looked a little dried up - maybe she is currently breat feeding?  I don't know, I've never seen this before.


She was somewhat shy; she didn't want me to arouse her, although I think I managed a little. She certainly did not want my fingers to go in. However, I did manage to get her wet, and the eye contact was nice.
She then provided me hand relief, and it was good. She asked questions, e.g. do I want it fast or slow, etc, and responds accordingly.


Would I recommend her. Yes, I think I would, but I think I want young taught girls in their 20s. Nonetheless, a pleasant relaxing hour.

Date of visit: Thursday, 2013.05.16
Amy, 3/501 King Street
Age: early 30s I think. 
Nationality: MLC
Rates: $30/30 +extras (see below)
Services: erotic massage, HJ
Contact Details/Address/Weblink : (02) 9587 1830


Dropped in here on a Thursday night, around 8:45, without a booking, got Mary because she was free. Took 30 minutes because hot young ones are more my scene.


However, Mary is quite nice. She is frisky, doesn't mind you feeling her up. She does the finger nail thing over your scrotbox. One thing about the MILFs:- there tease, tackle-tickle and attitude ofertn beats the young ones hand down.


I got some nipple suckage and felt her up, which she seemed to enjoy. While all this was happening, her tchnique and attitude had me stiff as a rocketship. Had to hold her hand a few times to stop the little Doctor blasting off early.


I had Mary aroused. Or, if I didn't, then she fakes it very well and - more importantly - convincingly.


Eventually, old faithful blew. All over the place. The hot towel cleanup was great.


Only one downside. In order to towel my back and crack, I had to turn over. I detected a little of my eruptive juices still on the massage table, so a bit icky touching your own ejaculate.


Otherwise, I recommend her wholeheartedly. Excellent attitude, quite frisky.


Note, there was an offer for her to get her kit off. I did not even negotiate price, as for me the MILFs are more exciting when their physique is mysterious. I would rather get aroused by a feel of smooth thighs, than to be put off my c-section etc. By all means get her to take it off if you like that sort of thing. I cannot comment on her body shape, as she was clothed throughout. Looked slim and Ok.


Tipped her $20 for her troubles, before slinking off into the anonymous Newtown night.

 Yumi at 501 King Street, Newtown
				
Post Content: 
Date of visit: 2013.06.22 (Saturday)
Name: Yumi, 3/501 King Street
Age: 23
Works: Saturday only (was new, so this may change)
Figure: Hot and relatively slim (but not waif-like)
Nationality: MLC; Great English, has been here for 7 years.
Rates: $50/60 + $50
Services: erotic massage, HJ (she was nude except panties)
Contact Details/Address/Weblink : (02) 9587 1830
Recommended : Definitely.


I turned up without a booking once more. This time, again the first cab off the 
rank, I got Yumi. However I was in the room before she was introduced to me. 
Originally I had planned for half an hour but as soon as I saw her, I extended 
to an hour. Yumi is a lovely little pocket rocket - not very slim but certainly 
not chubby and she was wearing a lovely little zip up the front nurses dress 
with "Miss Massage" written on it. 


We started with the usual massage activity, my lying on the front. However, she 
was not averse to my engaging in other nefarious activities with my hands. I was 
actually quite exhausted after gym session the night before, so I did ask her 
for something strange-an actual massage before we started. So she massage very 
brilliantly - this girl has great technique. However, eventually the massage got 
soft and I turned over and I was hard. We negotiated extras; I negotiated for 
her to strip off, everything came off except her panties. Seeing her unzip that 
little pink Miss Massage nurse's uniform was a major turn on. She has a lovely 
slightly curly little hairstyle and a beautiful face. Those little puppies are 
Bs, were very suckable. I started licking  those and working on her nipples and 
kissing down almost on the verge of DATY but I didn't get there for safety 
reasons. However she smelled very nice. Eventually my hands started working 
between her legs and I certainly ended up getting her off - Wow! Then she 
decided to repay the favour.


Now, while I was talking to her I asked whether she worked elsewhere and indeed 
she does. It seems that she works at 252B Parramatta Road Stanmore. Now judging 
by her technique I'm pretty sure she is Lisa from there. When I was on my back 
she sidled up in front of me and placed both my thighs over her legs so she was 
very close to the little doctor, and working him expertly. This girl's technique 
is magnificent. It didn't take long for her to have me on the edge, but of 
course I kept getting her to stop so that I wouldn't cum to early. Eventually I 
build up to a climax and went everywhere. This girl is fantastic - I love your 
technique. The way she sits there just below your legs focusing intently on your 
little fella is going to set you off.


Just some identifying features if anyone wants to compare whether you've seen 
her anywhere else. She has a tattoo on her right shoulder blade of - I think it 
was a horse.


Highly recommended.

I turned up without a booking once more. This time, again the first cab off the

Originally I had planned for half an hour but as soon as I saw her, I extended 
to an hour. Yumi is a lovely little pocket rocket - not very slim but certainly 
not chubby and she was wearing a lovely little zip up the front nurses dress 
with "Miss Massage" written on it. 


We started with the usual massage activity, my lying on the front. However, she 
was not averse to my engaging in other nefarious activities with my hands. I was 
actually quite exhausted after gym session the night before, so I did ask her 
for something strange-an actual massage before we started. So she massage very 
brilliantly - this girl has great technique. However, eventually the massage got 
soft and I turned over and I was hard. We negotiated extras; I negotiated for 
her to strip off, everything came off except her panties. Seeing her unzip that 
little pink Miss Massage nurse's uniform was a major turn on. She has a lovely 
slightly curly little hairstyle and a beautiful face. Those little puppies are 
Bs, were very suckable. I started licking  those and working on her nipples and 
kissing down almost on the verge of DATY but I didn't get there for safety 
reasons. However she smelled very nice. Eventually my hands started working 
between her legs and I certainly ended up getting her off - Wow! Then she 
decided to repay the favour.


Now, while I was talking to her I asked whether she worked elsewhere and indeed 
she does. It seems that she works at 252B Parramatta Road Stanmore. Now judging 
by her technique I'm pretty sure she is Lisa from there. When I was on my back 
she sidled up in front of me and placed both my thighs over her legs so she was 
very close to the little doctor, and working him expertly. This girl's technique 
is magnificent. It didn't take long for her to have me on the edge, but of 
course I kept getting her to stop so that I wouldn't cum to early. Eventually I 
build up to a climax and went everywhere. This girl is fantastic - I love your 
technique. The way she sits there just below your legs focusing intently on your 
little fella is going to set you off.


Just some identifying features if anyone wants to compare whether you've seen 
her anywhere else. She has a tattoo on her right shoulder blade of - I think it 
was a horse.


Highly recommended

Thanks to the kind mod who has nicely moved my posts out of silver. I went crazy and dumped my load, so to speak, in silver. Tiredness at the time was my explanation.

Re her being Michelle at 252B: I wish there was a unique ML identification system Maybe this is a task for me... "Right,  if anyone asks your name, tell them that you are ML number 37"

Already done if you can believe 'John Le Carre' (Kim Philby's biographer if you will, although Grahame Greene probably gets closer to the leader of the 'Cambridge 5' in 'The human factor') in the 'Honourable Schoolboy', in the scene where Jerry Westerby threatens Frost with exposure after they visit an up market HK brothel together.

Frost, still re-living the night in the brothel, asks who the lovely woman was, and Westerby replies absently 'No. 37'.

Hi Brother DrBob,

LIKE your review on little Yumi very much - she is Michelle from 252B Stanmore alright, I just want to comment on a few points on your post..............haha

I know this young lady very well and I call her the sexy little apprentice, that's apprentice to Mimi and Coco, that movement of her placing your legs/thighs over hers so that she can access your undercarriage was a signature move from Coco - which I am very proud to say was taught to her by yours truly here way back when she was Ada at Snow Lotus.

So Yumi was wearing that tight little nurse uniform with "Miss Massage" on it. Well, Coco is not gonna be too happy about that, those nurse uniforms were provided by Coco for the MLs to wear at Stanmore, I don't think it is right for her to wear that to work in another shop. I better not say anything..........lol

BTW, that tattoo on her is an unicorn.

You wear guessing she could be Lisa from Stanmore because of her strong massage skills, well, she is not and obviously you have not met Lisa yet. All I can say is, Lisa's massage is on a total different level and the firmness and techniques are unmatch in Sydney RnT shops, so if you appreciate a strong massage like after another gym session, may be you should see Lisa sooner rather than later, and she also has the softest and very sensual part 2 skills too.

Oh, there is one thing that you are missing out for seeing Yumi/Michelle at Newtown, I will PM you for that, but she is back in China at the moment so you will have to wait a month or so before you can see her again.............lol

Great to see other brother's different perspective on some of my favourite MLs........

Cheers

Person's Name :  Cindy

Establishment :  501 King St Newtown

Date of Visit :  August 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business :  10am - ?

Rates : $30 half / $50 hour + tips

Age : 20s

Size/shape : Slim, A cups

Nationality or Ethnicity :  Chinese

Services Provided :  RNT + nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? :  Yes

My experience/comments :

Every now and again you have a really good session. The girl is friendly and works hard to make your stay a pleasant one. My time with Cindy was like that. I called ahead to book Cindy because I had heard she was one of the better younger girls at this shop. I show up and Cindy greets me with a smile wearing a simple black skirt and top looking quite pretty. I pay for an hour and settle down to wait for her.

In she comes and starts a reasonably good massage that is enthusiastically delivered- worked on my shoulders and back primarily. Jumps on my back a few times (I always find this cute). Not professional standard by any means but scored quite a few points for enthusiasm. Anyway time comes for turn over and Cindy asks me if I want a HJ and of course I say yes! I then ask if she will 'take off' and she strips down to a g string showing quite a trim body with A cups.

HJ was quite good too, not hurried, quite a bit of two handed action building to a nice climax. Finished up with hot towels and a head massage. Nice. No time wasting with Cindy I got the full hour.

So a tick in every box - nice girl with good attitude. A word of warning Cindy speaks virtually no english. Made me realise how crummy my mandarin is getting (I'll have to brush up a bit). Left with a smile on my face after being pampered by a pretty girl.

Howdy Everyone,

This is a review of Peggy.

I am ok now folks, but for the last few weeks I’ve been in rough shape. My attitude of sweet intention has been sorely tested.

Just the other day I walked past a petrol station being ripped up. I suspect they will be putting in sub-standard townhouses they’ll sell for a million bucks each and that will collapse if the wind spend exceeds 8 kilometres per hour!

There was a horde of guys milling around and leaning on shovels while one poor sucker in a caterpillar was moving tons of soil and concrete so that the petro storage tank could be removed. Amongst this mob of no-hopers stood,  what looked like, the boss. He wore one of those plastic safety hats that wouldn’t protect your cranium from a bird turd, a cheap glow in the dark vest, an Ipad Mini in his hand and a fag hanging from his hideous gob. Me, being that guy with sweet intentions, engaged him in the following interaction.

Kerouac: I wouldn’t do that if I were you.
Boss: Do what?
Kerouac: Smoke that coffin nail around here.
Boss:  And why not?
Kerouac: The petrol fumes could cause a blast and
Boss: And what?
Kerouac: Blow that plastic hat with your head still in it 90 metres straight up!
Boss: Go fuck yourself!
Kerouac: I don’t think physically I can do that.

AND

I walked away pissed off and muttered under my breath a variety of insults I wished I had thrown at him. You know, stuff like “I’ll make you my lap dog you hooked-nosed motherfucker!” AND “I’ll kick you so hard you cocksucker you’ll be wearing your arse for a hat!” AND I went on and on as I walked down the street with this and other stream of consciousness bullshit racing through my head.

Where was I?

Oh yes, this is a review of Peggy.

I marched into 501 for the first time in a few months to be met by the lovely Miko. She had her hair permed and tinted and I think looks btter by the day. Like a fine wine, Miko just keeps on keeping on. Today she steered me to Peggy.

Peggy told me she was 30, but I think she could pass for younger. She is slim with a nice face, A-Cup  breast and small dark nipples. (The rest I didn’t see.) She had a Buster Brown haircut and I felt it must have been a rough day for her because her hair looked like she was wearing a cheap fright wig.

Her English and massage skills are as poor as my Mandarin. I asked for ‘medium’ and she damn near broke my back. Most of the massage was with a towel over me and I am not a fan of the towel technique for kneading the kinks out of muscles. (If you don’t hear from me again it is because I was wrong and she did damage my spinal column rendering little more than a taking head.)

Extras were on the table BUT you would need to be Bill Gates to afford them OR you take out a 50 year loan with the Commonwealth Bank.

The handjob had all the skill of the Australian Cricket team competing for the Ashes.

Folks, I think the golden days of 501 are well and truly gone. Jo-Jo, Sasa, Nana, Annie and Daisy are mere memories. This lot there now could not massage a left toe between the lot of them without breaking it and if their lives depended on it. As for extras, thy seem to be  a hundred times more expensive to maintain than an asylum seeker.

I’ve said enough.

It’s good to be back.

Hope we meet again soon.

Until that time folks . . .until that time.

Jack

Some famous 501 supporter quoted on the other site. The good value/quality ones that left in this shop can be counted by one hand. The worse think now is that you hear Miko and some of the girls openly calling newtown customers shit and stingy. May be that is the way they want to flash out the out customers. But I think it's a very stupid way of doing it.

With the price some young gals charging here, they are no different than 252 or any other city shops. Really no point going anymore......so sad

Rates : 30 /30 45/45  60/60

Age : hmm maybe 30 

Size/shape : Slim to medium,  B-C cup 165 cm tall

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage , HJ

Extras available : yes

Value for money/recommend? : Vicky was great,  but other circumstances would not convince me to return to this establishment.



A few months ago I started writing this, and just realised I didn't finish the review. Apologies for the delay.



501 King St.,  one of the many massage shops in this area.

Popped in one afternoon after calling to book Vicky (based on reviews) . 

Once inside was escorted to a tiny room that had a heater blasting.  
Turned it off, and then the receptionist brings in three very ordinary looking student types. 

Hmm where’s Vicky I ask?

A bit of confusion.. some clucking in Chinese outside the room.. shuffling of feet, more clucking… clock ticking… all sorts of whispers and then louder  voices..   Eventually vague receptionist pops back in and says Vikki is busy.. ‘will be available in 5 minute..’.

Hmmm.. seems like déjà vu of other shops, bookings can be meaningless.

 10 minutes later an attractive lady comes into the cubicle. 

Vicky is under 170cm, quite a pretty face slim/medium build. Once unclothed her C cups are slightly  sagged, but still  lovely, long hair,  and nice smile. 
A very big step up from the three Oompa Loompa’s I had reviewed earlier.

She is smiling and starts undressing me.  And hinting we may be a bit rushed due to the traffic jam building up. She upfront asked me if I want her clothes off and HJ, then it would be 30$.  
No worries.

Soon I am caressing her, kissing her neck, and hands roaming over her body and asking her if she would like a massage. Convinced her that my massage portfolio is vast, and she might like to try my freebie of the day.  

She happily agrees and soon is laid out on the table I am giving her a nice all round, 12 stations massage.  Aware of the time I move swiftly yet methodically massaging her back, bum,  thighs, legs, Vick subtly parts her legs for easy access for me to massage her deeper in the valley of a thousand pleasures...

 Soon I feel she is moist and her hand is running up my leg and she is saying…  ‘ this is nice’..

On her back I am now massaging her breasts, kneading and caressing and Vicky is heating up as my hands roaming over her stomach and inner thighs.  Vicky responds with all the right body language, and is able to concentrate enough to suggest any extra would need some monetary incentive. Agreed and a few more extras were indulged in over next 10 -15 minutes (details withheld to protect the innocent) .. 

Time up, Vicky cleans up and I get dressed.  Little chat and a hug and Vicky asked me to return for another ‘massage’ .   

She is ushered to another cubicle and obviously the go to ML at this joint and at that  time.

Vicky was lovely and experienced ML.

But I probably would not return due to the overall run down condition of the  shop,  lack of shower ( therefore the hygiene in general of the ML’s  could be a  bit dodgy I think ) the runaround  BS  I had with the receptionist was annoying.  

Cheers

Hi Everyone,

This is a review of Hannah.


I think my golden age was years 16 to 18. I thought I knew more than anyone else and felt I had the world by the tail. But I got demoted in stature when I got called up into the Army. Yeah,  a private citizen outranks a general boys, but a 2nd Lieutenant cops shit from everyone. I remember a Major threatening to demote me by saying he'd drop me a rank and I told him that wasn't possible because my ranking was lower than whale shit.

I'm always getting bumped down.  I can call one of those non-English speaking call centres, be put on hold and told I am 8th in line only to discover a few minutes later I am now 22nd. 

When I go to the bank I constantly get demoted. I stand in line forever. Everyone in front of me seems to have an issue that takes hours to work out. Finally when I get to the front some bank employee escorts some salty looking dude in ahead of me and, you guessed it, his issue takes years to resolve.

How does this relate to this punt? Well, historically I was in mamasan Miko's good books and when I'd come in she'd form a line-up for me and I'd have my choice. This time Diddy (my nephew} and I were given the bums rush into one of the rooms and Miko lobbed in Hannah faster than a McDonald's 'chef' slaps together a quarter pounder with cheese. So folks, Miko had demoted me to the ranks of the great unwashed and stranger category. I am probably removed from her Xmas card list to boot.

Hannah is mid 20's, chubby with B cups that are a tad too small for her torso. She is not pretty, but she has a pleasant face and English that could sometimes be mystifying.
Her 'massage' while somewhat comprehensive lacked some skill and it was sans 9without) enough elbrow grease to undo the numerous knots in my muscles.

The good news is that before turn over time she actually did a tackle tickle and her hj, while not spectacular, was ok. She seems to have extras written all over her so I think she would be worth another visit. Hannah is actually quite pleasant and the experience of being with her was better than the way I am making it out to be.

Before leaving Miko told me she expected me to come in 2 or 3 times a week. I think this was a subtle message that if I did this I would soon find myself no longer demoted.

This punt took place 3 days ago and since then I have seen Salina. Salina is a bit chubby and her breasts are one size too small for her torso. (There seems to be a pattern forming at 501.)  I will review her at a later date.

501 is no longer the place it was in its heyday when it had JoJo, Annie, Nana and Sasa BUT I saw some real potential with 'new' Annie and Lisa. They did look hot.. I will see you again soon.

I've got to go and Merry Xmas to all of you.

Until that time friends . . .Until that time.

I already kind of know that. I've actually seen Selina say hello to customer then come out and tell Miko she can't do that customer cos he want FS. I just like here looks but I retain myself from seeing gals who don't go all the way these days.

There are so much on offer these days in others shops even Billy's got some good MILF. I agree with you that this place had demoted long time ago as our favourite playground.

She has a slim body which she had hidden under a not so flattering dress. Face is nice but didnt seem too interested and just wanted to get the job done. Miko says you need to see her more for her to open up. Massage is average and took the NHJ option. Dress came off to reveal a slim tidy body and nice tits but hj could have been better.

Howdy All,

This is a review of Salina.

Upon arrival I had a talk with owner Davie. Davie mentioned that he hopes to have a sister shop open again in Liverpool in early February. He has a place picked out and waiting for DA approval.

Before I tell you about her you need to know the context of this. Let me start by saying I am a guy who likes to talk to people. My motto has always been that the definition of a stranger is a friend I haven’t made yet. I like to ask questions and am also a fairly open guy who doesn’t mind answering them.

For example, when I was called up into the US Army they gave me a thorough physical examination. At the end of the examination I spent 10 minutes talking with an Army psychiatrist Capt. Hymie Goldman. Being the coward I am, I asked him what would keep me out of the Army and the following questioning ensued.

Goldman: Do you have flat feet?
Kerouac: No
Goldman: Are you blind in one eye?
Kerouac: No.
Goldman: Are you addicted to drugs?
Kerouac: No
Goldman: Are you a homosexual?
Kerouac: No.
Goldman: Are you a member of religious group opposed to war?
Kerouac; I’m Jewish does that count?
Goldman: So am I. We fight all the time! Are you an only child?
Kerouac: No.
Goldman: Do you have a hearing impairment?
Kerouac: Huh? I can’t hear you.
Goldman: That finishes you assessment.
Kerouac: I still can’t hear you.
Goldman: Hear this! You’re in and you’re fucked!

Fortunately for both of us Hymie and I remained total strangers (shalom), but I didn’t mind the questioning and answering session I had with him.

This brings us to Salina..

Salina is a rather solid looking lady in her mid 20’s. I say she is solid looking to mean she is not fat, but she has that’ I will put on a lot of kilos in a few years time’ look about her. She has a pretty face with what looks like size B breasts. English is not too bad.

Massage was nothing to write home about because it s basically nothing. She sort of tried, but had no real technique. As she ‘massaged’ we talked and most of it consisted of her grilling me. Here is an example.

Salina: Are you married?
Kerouac: Divorced.
Salina: How long you divorced?
Kerouac: 3 years.
Salina: Why you divorced.
Kerouac: That’s complicated.
Salina: You having sex with another woman?
Kerouac: No.
Salina: She having sex with another man.
Segal: No!
Salina: You looking for a new wife?
Kerouac: No
Salina: Why not?
Kerouac: You have a boyfriend?
Salina: Yes.
Kerouac: You have sex with him?
Salina: That’s personal!

Holy shit. I felt she was grilling me like a pork chop. She asks me a whole lot of personal questions and when I asked her 2 questions and she claims it’s too personal! Plus, she said she thought I was 70 years old!!!

Needless to say, I was not exactly in mood for an intimate encounter with said Salina. When she started to give me a hand job it was a half arsed effort and I wound up finishing myself off.

Will I see Salina again? If you don’t know the answer to this question I will be conducting English Reading 101 on Boxing Day.

See you again soon where I review the lovely Vicky.

Until that time friends . . .until that time.

Jack

G’day Mates,

This is a review of Vicky.

Before I write about Vicky I need to give you some context for this punt. A couple of weeks ago I went to 501 with my nephew P.Diddy and I saw Hannah while P.Diddy saw Vicky. Hannah is not a looker, but trust me there is more potential there than with any of the other girls at 501.

Anyway, I got off topic. P.Diddy is a pain in the arse. Seriously, he is a guy who will have a punt on the way to a punt and then have another punt on the way back.

I have been kind to Diddy and thrown him some good wl’s over the years including Arab Mary at Burwood and unbelievably beautiful Donna at Bellevue. He squandered both situations and quite frankly deserves anything bad that may come his way.

Diddy advised me that Vicky had sort of the face of a man, but gave a really good massage. Face of a man? I thought what is going on here? Are we entering the outskirts of Trannyville?

Don’t laugh. When I find a massage lady who can actually massage I am in hog heaven and will see her until the cows come home.

So, I rocked up to 501 and Miko was taking a break and Davie was manning the fort. I know Davie from the old Burwood days so we had a chat and he advised he’s still working on getting up and running in Liverpool again.

So . . .I saw Vicky. SHE DOES NOT HAVE A FACE LIKE A MAN! I think she is actually pretty. At any rate, I paid for the hour and she gave a very hard massage and revealed herself to be a lady with a iron grip. Her massage was comprehensive and included feet and hands. She was a little too hard at times and I tried to avoid screaming so as to not alarm other patrons. Folks, don’t fuck around with Vicky because if she grabs that throat of yours, you’re history.

It was a very good massage with the hint of a tackle tickle.

Vicky has c cup breasts that are quite nice. Her body I also thought was lovely. She provided a good honest service and, unlike that stupid Selina, actually had a brain in her head. Part 2 can be rewarding if you treat Vicky right and I will go back to see her again. . She works most days here.

As for Diddy, I wouldn’t believe a word that comes out of his incompetent, lying mouth and will be getting him some glasses at SpecSavers soon.

Back again soon.

Until that time people . . .until that time.

Jack

Hannah seemed like a very nice girl, but there was absolutely nothing sexy or sensual about her or her services.
Don't get me wrong - I know it's a massage shop, but in the effort of a candid review, this is not the girl you're going to reserve if you're after something a bit better than a crap massage and standard ending. Massage was below average even for this place, and while Hannah really was quite nice, I just couldn't wait to get out and hit the reset button. HJ was mechanical but hey, I never have trouble getting over the line haha.

 Susan, Seinfeld and Kerouac
				
Post Content: 
Chinese Massage
501 King Street
Newtown.

Hiya Folks,

This is a review of Susan.

When I was young I saw myself as a 'big picture guy'. By that I mean I was not a details man. I looked at life in terms of large paint brush strokes and not the intricacies of existence..  

In order to make sense of this punt I need to talk a bit about Seinfeld and my life experience. Putting two episodes and life events together should make it clear to you how I see all this.

There is an episode in Seinfeld where George Costanza buys a used car. The salesman tells him it belonged to Jon Voight the actor. Elated about all this he takes Jerry for a ride. Jerry looks in the glove box and discovers the car manual and the name on it is not 'Jon' Voight, but 'John' Voight, who it turns out is a local dentist. George is deflated and tells Jerry "You've ruined it". George did not look at the fine details.

I bought a used car a number of years from a guy who lived on the opposite side of town from me. Folks, I loved that car straight away. The style, the pant, the leather seats, the purr of the engine, made it all love at first sight. It was well and truly Kismet.

When I took it home I proudly showed it to my mate Vaughn Camera and the following conversation ensued.

Vaughn: Jack this car's hood and roof look like the surface of the god-damn moon
Kerouac: What?
Vaughn: Look at that roof. It looks like some motherfucker took a sledgehammer to it.
Kerouac: What is that pitting?
Vaughn: Hail damage. Looks like they were golf ball size too.
Kerouac: I can get it fixed?
Vaughn: Not worth it. And listening to that engine I know the rings are shot!.
Kerouac: I should have looked more closely.
Vaughn: No, you should not have bought this bucket of shit!

I promised myself I would forever be a details man.

The second Seinfeld episode is one where Jerry is dating a beautiful lady, but when he looks at her from a different angle, or in different lighting she looks pretty crook. Let's call her 'Cutie with an evil twin'.

I did a review awhile back and wrote it about Vicky at this place. I told you that she was pretty and did a good massage and extras were on the table. I was impressed, but my nephew P.Diddy, who also saw her, was not. He told me she was actually a 'cuties with an evil twin' and he had seen both of them during his massage.

Kerouac: That' not true. I would notice a thing like that?
P.Diddy:Jack you'd think Willie Mason with a wig was Nicole Kidman.
Kerouac: What!?
P.Diddy: You stumble through the world like Mr. Magoo

So how does all this relate to this punt with Susan?

When I arrived at 501 I was greeted by mine host Davie. I convinced myself I'd be alert and see the small details. I looked at my watch to check the time so I didn't get diddled out of anything by a smarter than me ml.

Davie informed me there were two girls available. The two ladies were Susan and Vicky. I looked at Vicky and she looked quite pretty, BUT I put the Vaughn Camera stare on her and yep she was definitely the 'Cutie with an evil twin'. No Vicky for me today. I will see her again, but not when her evil twin is hanging around. So, I chose Susan.

Susan said she was 25, but I think she is more 30. Susan was wearing glasses and I found that very attractive. She has an average face, A+-B- breasts with ok nipples. Her body is weight for height and her English is functional.

I elected to stay an hour and the massage is difficult to describe. Overall it was too soft BUT she does an absolutely great butt massage and I enjoyed every moment of it.

I suspected there were extras on the table based on the 'out clubbing' style shoes she was wearing and the 'Darlings' she poured out like molasses from a molasses vat.

At turn over time. I popped the question about extras and we negotiated so that we were both happy with what we wound up with. Treat Susan well and you will strike oil. Be a cunt and you'll not get oil, but wind up with a duster.

Will I see her again? Probably not, but I enjoyed the punt.

I still need to write reviews about Lily at 12 Bellevue and Sasa at Red Sunset, but I have to depart ladies and gentleman.

See ya'll soon.

Until that time folks . . .until that time.

Jack

The usual experience here. Sophie is one of the nicer ones (had something to do with my tip?). After a not bad massage, she was happy to strip and allow me to perform DATY on her. Note: I think YMMV on the DATY, I think you have to be quite nice to her to get this.
Good HJ. She is very young looking with a hot body. Would defintiely see her again.

Maggie was a more usual girl here. Hot body, although her face is a bit pimply. To be honest, her massage is not great, but that's not why we come here, is it ?

After my tip, I had no issue getting her to strip off - but panties stayed on. She was happy for me to have my way with her nice tight young body. I did some nipple lipping and massaging her through her panties.

Ended up with a nice HJ. Yes, I'd see her again, but not for the massage.

Have been to this place a couple of times, and they usually have young girls, with varying levels of service. I booked in a session with Vicky, and found out that she has quite a cute face, and a nice body. Her part 1 of the massage is quite good, with long flowing strokes that made me warm up. When it came time to turn over, she offered a CBJ for an extra $50, to which a accepted. Her technique was quite good, and I could barely control myself before having to unload my man juice, in a fairly short period. She gave me a big hug and a kiss on the way out, definitely a nice touch that will bring me back soon (so many different ML's, so little time).

After leaving it to the last moment in Auckland, I didn't manage to get into 146 Karangahape Street, Auckland. I wlaked up, but they were all busy and I had a plane to catch. However, the place looked really neat and tidy, with a nice friendly Maori/Islander mamasan, who wished me a good flight when finding out I didn't have time to stay.

Anyway, so back to Newtown, toey as I was. Booking 10 minutes in advance, took Kelly sight unseen. A new Kelly from the one I had here before.

She is slim. Perhaps dressed that way, but once I got her clothes off (panties excluded), she exhibited a tight slimm body. To keep a logn story short, as this was a week ago:
after the turn over, which came soon, Kelly was very happy to comply with my requests. I wanted a long slow blow job, with gentle finger tip touches, which is what I prefer. She was happy to understand and follow these instructions, happily. So there I was on my back, with her kneeling between my legs. She teased me with fingertips over the little Doctor and the balls when I requested, with some external starfish touching as well. The slow build-up was great - none of this wank-wank-wank high frequency repetition. For one of the few times in my life, the orgasm came of its own accord without being forced. 

If you like the slow arousal to orgasm, Kelly is your girl. Just make sure you tell her politely what you'd like.

Highly recommended, if this is what you want.

Was very toey, came in and just wanted a HJ. Peggy was first off the rank. Nice girl, maybe late 20s. I simply asked her whether I could have a HJ, she seemed bemused, but OK.
I stripped off, lay down on my back, and went to work.


Although her technique may not be inherently great, she responds to advice, so I got her touching me nicely. She was creative enough to keep me aroused. I asked her to touch the balls, so she complied.
She was smiling - I think it amused her that I didn't want a massage.


Anyway, after about 15-20 minutes I came, thanked her. She cleaned me up with a hot towel, and off I went.

I think this place is slipping fast. It used to be my favourite because of the aspect of random chance. You could get a seasoned veteran that breaks your back and licks your sack, or a fresh and innocent student exploring her own personal limits. I liked the sense of chance.  But the last 3 times I've gone here I've had 3 different 30-something MLs that didn't deliver anything close to a good massage, continually tried to upsell me, and in one case actually ripped me off.  One had the gall to give me a standard $30-tip nude HJ service but after having already held my change from the house fee hostage, insisted she likes to charge $50 and just flat out refused to give my change back. I'm not the type to start arguing in a R&T shop, but it was just poor form and she was a homely girl with poor service to boot. Wish I remembered the names of these women (not girls) but se la vie.

If this shop were a stock, my rating would be changing from Buy to Sell!

Wendy, 6/501 King Street, Newtown
MLC, MILF
not really a turn on for me, asked her to stay dressed
$30/30+$20/HJ

I keep coming back to this place. This time without a booking, mid-morning, so I got Wendy. Mind you, the girl who was standing in as mamasan seemed hot, could be interesting 
Procedure was usual. I lay down, let her massage me. Delayed touching her, because she didn't turn me on. Eventually got horny from soem teasing, so touched her, and that led to roll over and a HJ.
Wendy's HJ is not that crash hot, and her English means that she doesn't really comprehend instructions too well. This meant that I got her wanking me with the boring up-down movement. I did eventually come, but through closing my eyes and doing (lots) of imagining.

Probably a nice girl, just not my style.

No reports on this place lately and I would hazard a guess it's because the value has evaporated over the last few months. I've been experimenting with other shops but found myself in the area with a sliver of time and decided to give it a shot. Was randomly assigned Mina who seemed very pleasant and friendly and well presented in a cute dress. Not a stunner, but not bad if you like the slightly chubby girl next door look with cute glasses.

Delivered a surprisingly skilled massage. Not truly professional, but great for a RNT shop. And even better, she quickly let her hands roam for an extended tackly tickly while on my stomach, which I really enjoy. She offered a turnover after about 10 minutes but I was enjoying it so much that I requested more! Eventually she stripped off and delivered a nice nude hj with just the right (little bit) of dirty talk. No fake moaning and writhing which is good for me as I find it distracting.

If you are a fan of the way HJs are delivered over at 298 Hurlstone, you'll like this girl. It's like they trained her. And I wouldn't be surprised if there were more extras available based on her demeanor. 

Overall a quality HJ and I would repeat.

Why do I keep coming back here? I'm in a groundhog day loop I can't escape! Things wrong with Rebecca: Average looking, average 'massage', immediate and constant attempts to upsell (No, I don't want ticky ticky with you!), checking her watch constantly, disinterested, bad teeth. Things right with Rebecca: Female.

Don't want to sound too harsh. Just saying that I would have gladly spent $50 elsewhere.

Howdy folks,

This is a review of Peggy.

There are a couple of observations I need to make before I go into detail.

First I would like to talk about the heart and soul of punters. By punters, I don’t mean guys who punt twice a year. I am referring to guys who see this as a vocation.

As my old Pappy used to say. “The only thing better than a dud punt is a good one!”

What does this mean? Take my nephew Edd ‘Kookie’ Byrnes. Kookie in punting always took a ‘no walk’ policy. No matter who was on offer Kookie would stick around. This occurred from the very start of his punting career. He was a young shaver and went to Croydon where he fucked a super bbw Greek granny.

Kerouac:: How was it?
Kookie: Shithouse,
Kerouac: Then why go through with it?
Kookie: It was an adventure!
Kerouac: Adventure?
Kookie: You had to be there.

Kookie then went on to describe how he, like many other punters, would pay to have sex with woman who he wouldn’t touch with a barge-pole if he met them in a pub and they offered it for free. I have been there and done that because it is the nature of the punt for it to be an adventure and journey into the unknown.

Then there’s my other nephew Efrem Zimbalist ‘P.Diddy’ Farquar. For him, the punt is everything and the buzz of the punt is what excites him. As I have mentioned before, I have gone out on a punt with Diddy and he had a punt on the way to meet me. At other times he would meet we, we would punt and then he’d punt on the way home. That what I mean when I say for some of us it is like a 
vocation.

One final point before I talk about this punt. It has been said that a good definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome. That’s me all over. The following interaction with Diddy illustrates this:

Diddy: Why do you come to this coffee shop?
Kerouac: What do you mean?
Diddy: The coffee tastes like shit.
Kerouac: Yep.
Diddy: The cups they put it in are dirty.
Kerouac: I know.
Diddy: The staff here treat you like a moron.
Kerouac: I know.
Diddy: Then why do you come?
Kerouac: It’s terrible, but it’s bound to come good.

Given the above attitude has meant I will punt and see a lady who is absolutely hopeless and will return to her thinking things like, “Now she knows me she’ll give me top drawer service!” (Note to Kerouac: You have no evidence this thinking is accurate!)

The golden times of 501 seem to have past. The diamonds seem to have been replace by zirconias nd the silver with tin foil. I am sort of like Michael Corleone in the Godfather. I try to get out but somehow keeping getting dragged back in.

This brings us to Peggy. Peggy said she was 30 and that looked about right. She is attractive, but not really pretty. She is a bit slim. A cup breasts and a trimmed pussy. Her English is quite good.


Her massage is typical of those in the Chinese massage joints. It was not bad, but was not professional either. She has a pleasant personality and her work on the back, arms and legs was quite good. She massaged the hands well. She did slight tackle tickle.

At turn over time I negotiated extras. They are there to be had and she seems to have in her had a clear price for whatever it is she is prepared to do. I won’t say she cunning, but behind her rather innocent demeanour is a lady with some street smarts. (Note to Kerouac: Everyone has street smarts compared to you!)

The experience as so-so. I have no complaints BUT I felt if I saw her again it would be much better, hotter etc.

Alas, it was like the coffee shop. Massage was the same and extras were performed as a carbon copy of the first event.

So there you have it. She was ok, but Peggy is nothing to write home about. Probably not worth writing a review bout either.

At any rate, I’ll probably see her again because something in me tells me she’ll come good, even thought I have no evidence for this.

I am so behind in my reviews.

Coming attraction: Interaction with CoCo at Bellevue:

Coco: You so handsome man Jack.
Kerouac: I am as ugly as a baboon’s arse.
Coco; Baboon’s arse handsome.
Kerouac: Yeah.

Coming reviews include Amy and CoCo from Red Sunset.
‘New’ CoCo from Bellevue.
A double with Candy and YuYu from Bellevue.

Well time to go.

See you again soon friends.

Until that time mates . . .until that time.

Jack

Hours of Business: 10:00 – 9:00
Rates: $35/30, $50/60
 Age: Mid to late 20’s.
Size/shape Nice and slim body.
Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Value for money/recommend?: Extras a bit over priced.
My experience/comments: Seel below.


Hi All, 

This is a review of Jacqueline.

“ I am sentimental too . . “
                 James Dean in the movie Giant.

I am both sentimental and nostalgic. Look at the photo on the left. That is a sentimental and nostalgic face. ( Note: Kerouac wipes tears from both eyes with the back of his hands.)

Every time I go to 501 memories of  the ‘good’ old days in Burwood come flooding back.

In those days Billy of Marrickville was Billy of Burwood. He was located in s run down, two story place. It was dark, dusty and inhabited by the smell of rat urine, filthy carpets. Tired and worn out Asian milfs and broken down furniture. I think the joint was cleaned once every six months whether it needed it or not.

In those days I’d often punt with my nephew Edd ‘Kookie’ Byrnes. We’d go to Billy’s and I’d get in constant fights with Billy, He seemed to have a policy of giving the old hags and grannies to the Westerners and give the few hotties he had to the Asians. 

This pissed me off big time and we’ d have arguments like the following

Kerouac; I don’t want Hazel. She’s old enough to be my granny.
Billy: She’s experienced. You like her.
Kerouac: So is my granny.
Billy: Then you can see your granny.
Kerouac: I want to see Toni (Looks about 40)
Billy: You won’t like her.
Kerouac; That’s for me to know and me to find out.
Billy: You take Hazel.
Kerouac: Billy, will you do me a favour?
Billy: What?
Kerouac: Take that cigarette out of your gob and stick it up your bony arse.
Billy: You take Hazel!
I’d storm out of his filthy join with steam coming out  of my ears. Because it was close to where I lived, I’d return two weeks later and fuck Hazel.

Before 501 was 501 it was in Burwood too. It was a strange place on the first floor of a block of flats. I remember they used to have a massage table in the kitchen and Kookie had the hots for one of the girls named Alice. He must have spent a fortune on her and talked about her so much that even now my eyes glaze over if I ever encounter anyone with that name.

Miko was running the place with Dave and I always had the hots for Miko.

I wanted Miko.
I needed Miko.
I desired Miko.

BUT 

I never got to first base with her.

When they moved over to Newtown, they had some great girls at first. There was JoJo and her sister Sasa, Linda, Thai NaNa, Mia, Daisy, Richie and heaps others. Most knew how to massage and extras were on the table.

Well, the Burwood days are gone and it appears to be the same for the golden days of 501.

This time I had Jacqueline

Jacqueline looks late 20’ with I think a very pretty face with kissable lips. She has cute little a-cups and a very closely trimmed puss, surrounded by a flawless body. She is fluent in English.

Her massage technique is hopeless I asked for medium and wound up with feather dusting. She seemed to forget that I had feet, arms, legs and hands too. She focused 90 percent of her time on my back.

Extras were available, but I think Jacqueline has tickets on herself as they are pricey and she is hardly a dynamic person on any level.

Anyway, I had my way with her, but it wasn’t really worth it all.

Looks: 8/10 I really liked her face.
Massage; 2/10 poor
Body: 8/10 with tattoo on lower back.
Attitude: 6/10

It was after this punt that I saw Malisa at 12 Bellevue and had a horrible time. Malisa acted like I was paying her to treat me with contempt. That thinking is ridiculous. It I want to be treated like shit my ex-wife will be happy to do it for nothing.

Well, I’ve got to go mates.

Coming attractions:

“We’ll start off with a massage”, Ayaar at 28 Hope Street, Seven Hills.

I’ m off and will return.

Until that time friends . . until that time.

Jack

Post Content: 
Service Provider's Name: Jackie
Date: 12 March, 2015
Type of Service: Massage, HJ, naked
Name of Agency or Parlour (if any): 6/501 King Street, Newtown
Background: MLC, recently entered milfhood, but think she is still in her 20s
Cost: $50/30 + $50 upfront tip
works: 3 days a week, but didn't ask which. This was a Thursday.


I saw Jackie a few times three years ago. She is friendly and sexy.
I cannot recall how her massage was back then, but it is certainly great now. My only problem was, because we had a catch up chat and she told me abotu some changes in her life, I started thinking of her more as a person than a hot ML. This meant it took me a while to get up.
Nonetheless, her technique is perfect, and she had me stiff quite quickly. She was also happy to get undressed (totally) and - for me at least - to cop a bit of a feel.


I would not necessarily assume that this is available for everyone, but I am certain that I got her aroused (read into that what you will). And nothing turns me on as much as turnign a girl on.
With what I was doing, and her perfect treatment of the little Doctor (well, not so little at the time), I exploded, even though I was trying to hold it back.


A great experience with a nice lady. Highly recommended, although YMMV.

My experience/comments :

Had a bit of time to kill and was in the area - I should have gone somewhere else but I wanted to see if things had improved here. No recent reviews and I guess I know why, but I feel it's our duty to warn each other and vote with our wallets, so I will spare a short tale for you all.

Yo Yo was certainly nice enough, but was clearly more interested in FS/BJ and is the type of ML I would expect to find at one of the thinly veiled FS shops masquerading as massage parlours because the sex is on a massage table instead of a bed. Her massage had no skill at all (and let's face it, if you haven't picked it up by age 50, it ain't gonna improve from there), and she got to the tackle tickle within 10 minutes. Another 5 minutes later I was lighter by about 5mL and walking out the door, happy to be shorted the time just so I could leave. 

The sound of "Next time you sucky sucky fuck fuck" as I ran for the door still haunts my dreams.

(To qualify this bad review, I used to really like this place because it was a fun mix of experienced ladies and young girls in training, and a bit of a lucky dip, but always fun and low pressure. It's now just a bit sad instead of fun, but to each their own and YMMV.)

501 & 532 used to be the place to be for RnT and more, so many RnT Stars it's like the Hall of Fame !

Jojo, Sasa, Nana, Cici, Sophie, Linda and Mia and even the unbreakake Michelle was so memorable ! 

I wonder if David and Miko are still running the show ?

The only way it would ever return to its glory days is if we voted with our feet and barred the place, forcing management to change its pricing structure in favour of the staff.

Don Henley also sang: "Get over it!"

So I guess I agree with your sentiment of "move on, nothing to see here!"

Person's Name : Sar? Sarah maybe

Establishment : 501 King St NewTown Massage

Date of Visit : 06/042016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :N/A

Hours of Business : 7days 10am - 10 pm

Rates :  $50/ 45 mins massage (supposed to be 50 but no change given), + $40 full naked + happy ending 

Age : 20s

Size/shape :  size 5-6, med-petite Build 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage (others offered but not taken)

Recommend : Sure

Hard day of work left me wanting a massage, in a rare move I wasn't really looking for any extra so I figured fuck it, cheap and cheerful it is, walked in mamasan shows up, shows me to a room, asks for time 45 @$45, handed her a 5er by mistake then swapped it for a 50, she's never to be seen again, ml sar shows up, she's cute and smiley Nd looks mid 20s, I opted for the hard massage amd she delivers, nice and firm, the eventual 'you want *hand motions* and I knock her back, citing my wedding ring (a handy trick fir these rare times) she looks a little let down but says 'okay all good, next time' and proceeds to finish the massage in earnest, the surprising thing here is she doesn't get lazy, and does the hot towel wipe down when all done. As I get up im kinda hard and she compliments my cock, and says 'please next time'. Flattery will get you everywhere 

Review is aorta short and im writing it in the car afterwards but with no flip that tends to be the case

All in all, recommended for massage

Hours of Business : 10-9pm

Rates : $55/hr + $20 hj

Age : late 20's-30's

Size/shape : skinny, a cups, nice butt

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean 

Services Provided : massage +hj

Value for money/recommend? : average

My experience/comments : no booking and only CIci was available. Miko said it she was new and Korean. Cute face and nice body. Could hardly speak English and kept replying in Korean while she was trying to figure out the English word.
Massage was better than average but no teasing. She was wearing a very short skirt and when she was standing next to he table, I glanced back to get a good view of the butt and underwear. She noticed and tried to pull her skirt lower to cover and said she was shy. Turned over and she seemed surprised and covered me straight away. I said something about not needing the towel and then she blushed and said $50. Ended up just getting a hj for $20 and allowed to touch on outside of clothes. Didn't try going under. 
Spoke to Mico and told her she asked for $50 for nhj and she said she would talk to her as they don't want them charging that much. The free hj is gone now as girls don't want to work for them if they do.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : (02) 9587 1830
Hours of Business : 10-7
Rates : $35*/30, +$50 extras
Age : Jamie, mid 30s (in Aus 10 years incl a Masters at UMq, so that's a rough calculation).
Size/shape :  did not undress. Slim
Nationality or Ethnicity : Vietname/Chinese
Services Provided : massage, HJ
Value for money/recommend? : Yes
My experience/comments : 

Long time no see this place. Seems the previous mamasan divorced her husband, and she got the business. I walked in and saw two MILFS* including Jamie. 

*However, as we got into it, it seems that Jamie has not been married, so not really a MILF.

Her face is not stunning, but her figure is and she has a great personality. The conversation was good and, as she is doing a massage course, you will get a good quality massage.
I took the opportunity to stimulate her through her clothes. After asking about extras, she started on some tackled tickle.

This sounds transactional, but she was in fact very friendly and happy to do what you asked. Strangely, money was not discussed.

After the inevitable denouement, and the hot towel/cleanup, I started to walk out and realed I had not tipped her.

I gave her a pineapple, and she mentioned she'd go and get change. I said no no, so she ran up to me and hugged me from the back and gave me a kiss (peck on lips) and said thank you.

By the way, I mentioned she is doing a massage course, and requires documented experience, so please sign her book for her if possible. Please do not fake your details as - although there is little chance - they might call to confirm her experience. 
Even if you are not happy to sign, she is worth a visit.

This place is almost history now. I was in the area. Took the opportunity despite no recent good reporting . I was greeted by  old lady. I think new receptionist. 
So Maggie gets in the room. She is quiet good looking milf with nice figure. Seems really friendly. So i took one hour option . Massage was above average, i think she will improve if she get proper instruction from
master. 2nd part was good . Very gentle and erotic. I had really nice experience. I dont like part three in massage shop, But i inquired if service is in the offer for next visit , in case any brother interested. She told me mine is too big, I would say mine is above average . Not big really.  may be she is open to it but not a sure thing.
I will recommend her  for sexy milf look and massage.

Tried an old place I used to go the other day. 

Used to book for one hour oil massage, and happy ending would be standard with that... 

Seems to have changed, as no play this time. 

Did get her name, but pretty decent straight massage. Female clientele present also. 

Bluballed.

Hi maxwell,

You wouldn't happen to have an address & phone number for this place by any chance?

Thanks,

Thai Massage?
Enmore?

Possibly this place. Used to be associated with Lindfield Thai Massage - the banner with the web address is still on the side wall of the Lindfield place and the purple logo is the same, and I am sure the Lindfield location was also listed on this website. This was some years ago (and at least two changes in management at Lindfield) ....

The link between Enmore and Lindfield is strange. They appeared to have same website but they have little in common. I visited Enmore some years ago. The women were on the older and larger side. They gave great Thai massages. If you paid extra for an oil massage they would through in a hand job but there was no teasing and they remained fully clothed (thankfully). I think it was always basically legit and it doesn't surprise if they went fully legit. Lindfield on the other hand was always 50/50 R&T from the start. Initially you could also get a good Thai massage but that option died out some years ago I think. Also the Lindfield girls usually were much better looking and the oil massage was nude. Lindfield was definitely linked with the Thai at Leichhardt and I think maybe Artarmon.

My experience/comments : 
Dropped in here yesterday afternoon, looking for a massage and perhaps HE.
Jib met me at the door and showed me to a room, told to undress and she will return.
Naked and on the table she asks what sort of massage I'd like. I reply sensual, but that went over her head. She asked again, soft or medium, so I settled on medium. She oiled me up and away we went. Nice firm massage, concentrating on my hammies and butt cheeks. Worked her way up to the back and shoulders. Very nice massage. Turn over without any TT, but I had a semi anyway as I was in the mood for a tug. I made the appropriate motions towards the little fella asking if she could ease the pressure so to speak. She apologised to me and said she only does massage but "you can do if you like"? So I asked her to oil him up, which she did readily and as she massaged my inner legs and she studied little lofty intently as we talked about Bangkok, her two daughters and life in general, as I massaged the little fella. It was quite nice actually, she carried on and just watched as she worked and talked. I was allowed to rub and fondle her arse as she stood beside the table massaging my inner thighs. I told her I was about to cum and she provided a small hand towel for me to clean the jizz when done. She even assisted.
She is a lovely lass, who provides a nice soothing massage, but she just won't do any extras.
While i was getting the massage, there was a serious pounding/thumping sound coming from above. Theres a knock shop (Penny's 77A) above and by the sound of it, someone was copping a serious pounding. It sort of added to the experience downstairs as well, as I think Jib was a little embarrassed by the sound, when I mentioned it. 
All in all, I would return for the very nice, legit massage and pleasant conversation with Jib. 
Certainly NO chance of any extras there though.

I saw this place a few days ago and thought I would take one for the team. It is run by Jessica who some of you know from her old place nearer to the station in Ashfield. She has moved to 305 Liverpool Rd. This is a totally legitimate remedial massage/acupuncture shop (so legit her 12 year old daughter felt safe to walk into my massage space unannounced to see her mum). However if you really do need a massage this is the place for you. She does an amazing job but the massage may involve lots of pain. A bit like Judy up the road if you have had a real massage with her. Except Jessica speaks English well and can explain what she is doing to you. I will be back as I really do need some serious massage work and will leave the extras to other places in the area. BTW, HF rebates are available which makes for a good value massage.

On two separate occasions on a Saturday afternoon I tried for a massage session at this joint and was told by a Chinese  MILF that she was busy (most probably was Jessica). Unless they only have the one ML working there or she was thinking I was looking for more than a massage. Well admittedly at that time I was, but now I know Jessica delivers a firm strong legit massage, I will try again for another time to ease my stubborn back knots. For anything more than a massage, there other establishments nearby when I can fall back on..

I have been using this place as my cover for a couple of months with the wife when I wanted to go to for a less than remedial massage. However, yesterday I decided I did actually need to see Jessica and get her to work on my painful bits. She suggested acupuncture and as I hadn't tried this before I was quite happy to give it a go. She reassured me it wouldn't hurt and largely it didn't. The knee actually feels better today and I am going again in a couple of days for another treatment. This woman seems to know her stuff so I would recommend her for a remedial massage or acupuncture. She also gave me some Chinese medicine which I am not so sure about but I will give it a go. She is also quite a sexy MILF but she is definitely off the menu. Pity. It must be hard being a legit Chinese woman working in this field. I think she is a bit suspicious of western men.With good reason too!

I have now been back to Jessica a couple of times for a mixture of remedial massage and acupuncture. This woman is the real deal. I have decided to give up on my physio and just see Jessica as she offers a better service at a cheaper price. As said before she is also a sexy MILF and I couldn't help have little massage boy at half mast today despite the pain she was inflicting on me, However with undies on and a towel over me i hope she didn't notice.If you really need a serious massage and are prepared to put up with some pain to get better, Jessica is your lady. She's not terribly busy, except on weekends but better to book.

I am a regular here when I want a serious remedial massage. Jessica's massages are highly skilled and very painful if you have a real problem. She is definitely from the 'no pain, no gain'. school. Last week I tried Annie, her offsider. I went again today and was very impressed by her skills. She is prepared to compromise a little on the pain while giving a great remedial massage. She said in China, you can be trained in remedial massage, physio and chiropractory which she is. If you need  a proper massage with no chance of extras this is the place in the inner west. I get much better value here than I do from my much more expensive chiropractor. Also for 30 minutes she will accept a HF rebate for the total cost if your fund pays $30 as mine does. She can also be flexible on 60 minute visits. Highly recommended if you need medical rather than sexual relief.

I won't repeat the full details as are that are listed above. I know there is limited interest in legit massages on this site but I can't speak highly enough of Jessica and her main offsider, Lucy. If you really do need some serious massage treatment then Jessica should be your first port of call in the inner west. I have given up on my physiotherapist and just go to Jessica now. She is also highly skilled in acupuncture which I have also been receiving regularly. There is certainly no nonsense and there will be pain, but it is worth it. Jessica has HICAPS and it is possible to walk out paying nothing you your HF rebate.

I been here once and had a great legit massage. I'm guessing it was Jessica. Didn't ask for a name because I didn't want to come off as creepy. Will need a legit massage soon as I started up a full week of workouts at the gym after a winter break and feeling sore in places I didn't know I had muscles.

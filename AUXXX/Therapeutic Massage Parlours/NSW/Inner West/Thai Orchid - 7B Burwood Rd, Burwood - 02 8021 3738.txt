Value for money/recommend? : Definite yes.

My experience/comments : Came here without booking and was only given the option of 30 minute session due to bookings, took that although could have paid for full hour. Lady knew I was dissappointed about not being able to have one hour and gave me one hell of a good rub with a heating gel thing (it gave my back a burning sensation). Half an hour well spent I say.

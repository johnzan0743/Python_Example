558 Parramatta Rd
Googling the number reveals the name Naree Relaxing Massage while True Local says cash payment. 
Sounds like a new RnT just down the road from 429. 
Maybe time TOFTT
Was unable to find any approval for a massage shop at this location at either Marrickville or Leichhardt Councils. Used to be  dog grooming shop

Today I went to investigate this new B2B, Thai RnT, pulled up out front noticing the Clearway between 3pm - 7pm, s/w the Madam who advised the fare is $110 for the nude B2B Hand Job so decided to drive on to Jenny's Shit Hole on Canterbury Rd as for $100 you can get an additional natural blow job, a natural or cloved fuck and more but I weakened when a dirty Builder Tradie pulled up on his HiLux and beat me to the door, so I retreated

These days they can use the Exempt and Complying Development provisions of the Commercial Industrial Codes SEPP.
Provided certain criteria are followed, there is no need for a DA approval. (Not for brothels though.)

Person's Name : Fifi

Establishment : 558 Parramatta Rd, Petersham

Date of Visit : 6th June 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : see above

Hours of Business : 

Rates : $60/120 for 30/60 minutes

Age : late 20s?

Size/shape : B/C cup, some belly flab

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : nude massage, HJ plus extras (FS didn't ask price and CBJ $30 negotiated down to $20)

Value for money/recommend? : yeh, sort of

My experience/comments : It's been about 6 or 7 weeks since my last punt. My last ML was Rosie from Venus Place, Newtown. She, as I've reported, is a firecracker. Knows how to tease and excite a man. She enjoys playing and is great value for money.

So, it's with my last punt in mind that I head to this new shop. They've been open about 2 months now. I was after something a little different so decided, given the lack of reports about this shop, to TOFTT.

There is a rear lane access, so if you're a little shy like me you don't have to do the walk of shame in or out of the shop on busy Parramatta Road. Also, there is a small public car park across the lane where you can park for 2 hours.

The rear entrance is sign posted and you hace to ring a bell. I waited a moment and was greeted by Fifi, who was wearing a short and sheer negligee thingy. It looked very cute and hot on her.

She took me straight into a room to discuss what I wanted. Pretty standard prices (see above) which include nuding up from the start. I like this as there is no haggling for removing clothes later. And what's better than a naked woman massaging you while she sits straddled over your  backside???

I asked for an hour and then was asked to go to another room. They have 5 or maybe 6 rooms. This place has been refitted since its dog grooming days. The rooms are purpose built. Walls all the way to the top. Good size, great fit out. Nice and warm too. There is nothing here that makes me say unclean. Nothing that I saw, at least.

So she leads me into the room, asks me to strip and walks out. She comes back a few minutes later and strips.  

There is no question regarding type of massage but she says she'll massage first then play later! Her massage skill was pretty good and says to me a couple of times that she wants to give a good massage. I'm happy with that.

She eventually gets to the tickle tackle, but she seems to lack either the experience or the entusiasm. It's a little mechanical. But, hey! I'm not complaining, I've had worse.

On flip, she starts playing with the old fella and starts the moaning. I ask if I can touch (always a polite thing to do I reckon!) and she says OK, but no fingers inside, because it gets her too wet. Yeh, right.

Things start to hot up and she straddles me in reverse position and sticks her arse and pussy a couple of inches from my face. This, she says, is so I can get a good view. I'm not a fan of licking girls I don't know but damn that pussy and arse so close was very tempting. I love to give a good rimming. She makes all the right noises (for my benefit, I know) and asks if I want FS. I decline but a few minutes later I ask for a BJ. She wants $30 for CBJ to which I say I don't have enough (almost true). So we agree on $20. She hops off and leaves the room to get one. FFS! Can't they keep them handy in the room??

Anyway, she returns, wipes the oil off my dick and rolls on the dom. She gets to work blowing me. This is where I think she might lack some experience. It was good, I got over the line but it was not skilled or particularly teasing or sexy. While she was blowing me I thought I wouldn't mind fucking her arse. It was, after all, a gorgeous asshole up close. I asked for anal but she didn't know what that was. I had to explain. I got a straight up no.  Oh well, no harm in trying.

After I blow, she cleans me up and continues with the massage for a short while. About 10 minutes before the hour is up she says that she's finished and that I have 10 minutes for a shower. Hmmm, I think, that's a bit of a short change.

The shower is new and clean. They've obviously spent some money here. When I return to the room she comes in and gets her clothes (she still has her towel wrapped around her) and heads off to the shower. At least I know that she's clean.

So, all up not a bad experience but not great either. I think the shop has heaps of potential. There's a lot of competition in the area so it'll be interesting to see what happens over time. The new fit out, discreet back entrance and nude plus HJ included in the price make it a good option in the area. 

Will I go back? Yes. But I will ask for another girl. Fifi might make your boat float more than she did mine. She works in the afternoons and often as the receptionist. She told me there are 4 girls working.

What I would have liked was the option to choose. However, when I first walked in and she answered I asked who was on. She said that she was available. I wouldn't have picked her probably but I am terrible at this sort of thing. I mean, what's the protocol here?? You get a ML who happens to answer the door. But what if she's not really what you're after. How do you say thanks but no thanks in a way that doesn't offend?? (Please discuss)

Summary:
ML (appeal to me): 6/10
Massage: 8/10
HJ/CBJ: 6/10 (felt a bit mechanical and rushed). higher score if she slowed down a bit.
Premises: 8.5/10

I noticed the 'closed' sign and lights off at this joint at least three wees ago, it seems this venture had only a small journey. I wonder what could have been the catalyst, council gestapos, not a busy establishment or shop owners closed it not knowing this would have been a Thai R'NT joint..??

I had three punts there over the last few months. THey weren't the best of punts but good nevertheless. It's a shame as the place was really set up quite nicely. Each room (that I had been in) had full height walls, was big and nicely fitted out.
I wonder what happened there? It still had the dog grooming signwriting on the awning. 
Could we have reached critical mass in the inner west?? There are a lot of shops in the vicinity.
Oh well! Another one bites the dust, but out of the ashes I'm sure a new one will open up somewhere close by! And if so, I'll has to TOFTT!

I just drove past this shop today. It looks like they're back in business. The massage sign was lit up and an open sign hung on the door. 
I wonder if it's new owners or they just closed shop for a couple of months.
Hmmm....someone needs TOFTT! And that someone might need to be me. Next week I hope!

Alert to Punters - Lady Boy sighted at this establishment...

Once I heard the news this joint has re-opened, I thought to give it try  last night. Parked the car right opposite it and dodged all the outbound and inbound traffic just to get to the other side. The 'OPEN' sign on the see through glass door was visible, the door was locked, with no door bell I knocked on the door more than once. All of a sudden, I'm seeing from outside a muscular looking woman heading towards the door. She/he opened the door and was asked to come in when at this stage I clearly could identify a Lady Boy at present. Don't really want to provide any more details on the appearance side...

Anyway, took a deep breath and asked the question, ' So, do you have any girls working tonight that are free'..,she replied back with a boyish tone..' there are only two people working here, one girl and me..'  My reply was, 'Thanks, but maybe will try another night (when you are not around..just not my scene at all) ,so I went out the door, dodged the traffic again to get to  my car and headed to 252b Parramatta Rd, Stanmore to get all my senses back to normal. Will post a review on that experience later on...

Thanks for the heads up TheBigM. You went on a Monday, right??

Was planning on TOFTT this week and post a review. Now I'm not so sure. Maybe I'll ring ahead and check before hand.

Need some more intel on this place. It was a nicely set up shop earlier in the year. I wonder what has changed??

No problem Oztone, actually, it was last Sunday night. 

Oh yeah, I would recommend to call in first, although I didn't ask the LB for the establishment's number..it may well of changed since it re-opened.

What has changed? Who knows, maybe the new owners are thinking there is a market in the inner west for LB masseurs. Anyway, I digress..

THanks for confirming SeaRay. I was so close to going there last week, but ended up across the road. Despite not having a great punt at 429 I'm glad I ended up there and not here. I'm not one for surprises.

Lobbed in on a Friday evening at about 7.30. Opted for 30 minutes to see how this place stacks up against 429. Allocated Noi who looked okay. Lead to room which was well appointed, had walls to ceiling and a Thai themed décor. Stripped off and lay on massage table. Noi commenced a really poor massage, basically feather like touching. Things went down hill from there. At about 10 minutes in response to me asking Noi said she would not be nudeing up as was that time of the month. She said that she could get another ML. I advised her that I was not happy and terminated the massage saying I should have been told about this upfront. I then got dressed and then went to reception where I commenced discussion about getting a refund. After much discussion about upfront service honesty was given $20 refund. Needless to say I was not overly impressed and departed never to return. So be warned with this shop.

Age : early 30s

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage and HJ plus touching 

Value for money/recommend? : no

My experience/comments : Ok been in and out of the game for last few years, getting plenty elsewhere so not much time for mongering. I been to Thai 429 Parramatta Leichhardt across the road mid last year but outside the 3 month review remit.  Decided to try this Golden Thai place, it has a sign that they have a rear entrance in Queen street so an indication that this place is not as legit as it looks.  I was showed into the room by the lady and I asked her name and I think she said An but didn't quite catch it.  She spoke reasonable English so got the financials out of the way $45 for 30 mins ... this was going be a legit massage which I was kind of after cant remember if was offered shower. The massage was not very good, definitely better elsewhere.. then she asked if I wanted her to go nude and a HJ for $50.  Well I was there already so yeah ok,  give her the money and she got undressed.  She had a large tattoo on her side like a dragon, but nice tight body.  She give me a good HJ and I was allowed to touch her although she kept her rig out of reach, I got a good feel of her ass and finished with me cumming and I squeezed one of her ass cheeks in my hand.  She wiped me down and I was on my way.

$95 was poor value, could have had a better massage and HJ elsewhere.

 Bella - Lindfield Thai Massage
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Bella

 Establishment : Lindfield Thai Massage

 Date of Visit : Monday 23 Oct

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 346 Pacific Hwy: Telephone 9415 6217: Website Lindfield 346 Thai Relaxation

 Hours of Business : 10am-8pm 

 Rates : $65 / 30 mins all inclusive

 Age : Probably 30s

 Size/shape : Rather chubby, bit of a tummy, large natural breasts

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

 Services Provided : Nude massage and HJ

 Value for money/recommend? : Absolutely, $65 for a 30-minute fully nude massage and two handjobs is probably the best value to be found anywhere, better than the average Chinese place.

 My experience/comments:

I had visited this place once before, about the middle of last year, so I knew I could get a 30-minute nude B to B massage and HJ for $65, so I decided to pay another visit.  It was about 11:00 in the morning when I went up the back stairs and was admitted by a small, middle-aged Thai lady, who led me into one of the massage rooms. I told her I wanted to have the 30-minute body-slide massage.  She told me to undress and went off to fetch a masseuse.  As I was undressing, Bella came in, a short curvy lady with an obviously large bust.  She asked me for the $65, and then went out to give it to the mamas an.  When she came back I was fully naked, and standing waiting for her; she immediately stripped off completely, revealing a rather chubby body and very large natural breasts.  I asked her to massage my penis while I stood facing her, and she began a slow soft HJ with one hand while rubbing her vulva with the other.

Bella's technique was so good that it did not take long for me to spurt.  Then it was onto my stomach for the back massage.  She asked the usual question about pressure, and I opted for hard on my back.  What followed was a very competent remedial-style massage, not particularly sensual but very good for getting the knots out.  She even did some very intense elbow work, and it was obvious that she was trained in therapeutic massage.  Then it was time to turn over, and I asked Bella to massage my penis again, to which she agreed without demur. What ensued was a long and very enjoyable soft and slow penis massage, until time was up.  As I had not fully recovered from my first ejaculation I did not manage to get over the line again, but it was nevertheless a very nice sensation.

At the end, I asked Bella about the price of the 60-minute massage, as I was thinking that in 60 minutes I should be able to get two shots away.  I thought she said 150, but then she spelled it out, one-one-five.  Only $115 for a full hour, with the masseuse fully nude from the beginning, and more than one HJ if the customer wants!  What could be better value than that!  I compared that with the Chinese places, where on top of the base price you typically have to pay $20 for a clothed HJ and $50 for nude, so a 30-minute nude HJ can cost $90 all up, with the lady nude only in the second half, and a second HJ in most cases incurs an additional charge.

I might add that Bella speaks quite good English, having been in Australia for three years, so we were able to have a quite reasonable conversation.  I think I might well become a regular at this place; I have recently moved from Canberra to Upper North-Shore Sydney, so Lindfield is quite convenient for me.

My experience/comments : There is plenty of parking at the rear. There is a front entrance and a more discrete rear door. I had no booking and had to buzz for the door to be opened. Jessica opened the door and led me to a room. The other rooms looked busy, she said she was the only girl available. She asked if i wanted a shower. After the shower I went back to the room and waited for Jessica. Jessica removed her clothes from the beginning. Nice body, flat stomach. Jessica was easy to talk too. The massage was good and then after about 30 mins the wipe down with a warm towel. Jessica then started to do a slow rub and made her way to my cock. I then turned over and admired Jessica's body and felt her ass and tits while she pulled me until I came. Had a shower to finish and then left.
Overall a good experience.

rocked up to this place, it's 1st floor above the Pool shop and shares first floor with F45 gym.  Rang the bell and Bella answers in a silk pink robe. It was obvious she wasn't wearing a bra underneath and she had a great set for a Thai lady, I knew it was going to be fun.

into the room decide to go for 45 and price was $95, she waited until the coast was clear and led me to the large bathroom, had the shower and then wandered back to the room and jumped onto the table.  Bella very chatty, bubbly and speaks English well.  Opted for the medium massage, was good with the right amount of pressure, she then give me a B2B using those large soft tits to massage my back.  I really enjoyed when she did my shoulders and her soft boobs rubbed in my face.

on the flip she want straight for the cock, I wanted her to ease off and massage a little more...she offered me her tits to suck. She lay on the table giving me very gentle fingertip strokes.  I stroked her back and crack of her ass.  Touching was ok but she kept out of reach for any potential fingering.  She soon had me blowing my load, she disappeared to fetch a hot towel and wash her hands.  Finished of with the massage.

decided to leave by the back door and the mamasan asked did I enjoy this place.

might call back again, but have had better down the street and at 115 North Sydney.

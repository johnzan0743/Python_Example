My experience/comments :

All right punters,

It's been a while since my last post but this doesn't mean I haven't been burning the baby oil.

I used to visit this place when it was a certified R&T joint years ago. Then it went all legit and not a tug to save your life. Fiona (mamasan) complained that some limp wristed fellas had visited her place so much that they had done permanent damage to their wedding tackles. Some had phoned her to let her know and she feared legal action.  WTF! Fairdinkum…

Despite the new conditions, Fiona however, suggested I take on Wendy who 'is always in demand'. Wendy isn't much to look at and is no spring chook but she has a long stroke that extends to your Jatz crackers. Over time, my visits became more frequent and stayed for longer and in return, Wendy became more generous with her stroke.  As you will know, Asian girls enjoy building rapport and if they see that you’re a sensible fella as well as a horny devil, over time they will oblige more and more.

Wendy uses a variety of techniques with different parts of her extremities but the end result was always of Vesuvius proportions. But it’s the getting there that is lots of fun because Wendy likes to use a broad and long stroke which reaches your Netherlands.  And when you’re still on your gut, just before turning over, she will generously rub your groin and anus and eventually cup your balls and give them a good but gentle tug.  Make sure you have a clean choc starfish before getting there.  But it’s after you turn over that the fun begins.

By this time, Wendy is well aware of your given talents but she will not look or acknowledge.  She is a bit shy, you see.  But she will always let one a boob, or an elbow, or her hand rub your member and she will always concentrate on that midriff section.  She also does this thing where she rubs your pubic bone in circular motion with the balls of her hands that makes your Mr Squiggle stand to attention even more and feel like it’s gained inches.  By this time your throbber is also swirling about the room and feels like you’ll be taking off helicopter style.  But if I’m being honest, this feels great, and over all, Wendy’s body the massage is first class.

Wendy never charged for the happy ending. And she was gentle cleaning you right up with warm wet towels. Amazing!

2 hours = $135.00 though from time to time Fiona will text you daily specials such as $49.00 per hour. Ask for loyalty card which gets you half hour free after 10 visits. Value for money isn't the best, but massage is quite good and thorough.

Wendy is available on weekdays but from 11am. She's a bit lazy that way.

Book ahead on 02 9745 6680

I'm trying to get back my bronze membership so let's see how I go.

Hey H-T,

First of all, great review, hope you get that Bronze access..
Actually, I was a common visitor to this premises. but I haven't been back for a while. Had various girls in the past to massage me (inc Fiona..bless her), and all massages were awesome . Clean establishment, private rooms and nice facilities.
However, I never had the courage to ask for any extras, I guess at the look at the joint, to me it had 'legit' all written over...but now you given me a good reason to return.

Do you know if any other girls offer extras?

This place definitely used to offer a special massage (read with HJ) for $90 per hour. This was a couple of years ago and then I heard it went more legit. Nice clean place with good rooms so I might make a return visit and see what is on offer these days.

Yeah Sorry fellas. I got bronze which in this case is gold! Thank you for the feedback...

I got a nice HJ from Fiona a couple of years ago. When Fiona decided her joint was no long a RNT I stopped coming -in more ways than one. I returned last year and took me a while before Wendy graduated from teasing me to relieving me. I used to have to cover with a towel, but eventually this was not required. 

Wendy is not the chatty type. Or even friendly. But she knew I wanted more and she found ways of giving it to me. As I tried to explain, she didn't quite pull me. She massaged the area enough until I climaxed. So, in her eyes she wasn't tugging me. You feeling me man? (So to speak). 

Because the massages are on the dear side (get good massage + tugged for $50 @ South Pacific), I didn't see any others but Wendy. I guess I didn't want to spread my $ thin. But may be worth a look. 

The last time I went Wendy was a bit frosty so I think we're due for a change?

Good luck!

Wow. so Fiona did cater for HJs, damn ! If only I knew about the place before it became legit. Was it a strictly 'no hands policy. on her when she administered the HJ? She sure has nice proportional cups on here, she must been kind off hot in her younger days. But I always enjoy chatting with Fiona, really down to earth person. and of course, can give a great massage.

Back to Wendy and all understood now. I haven't been the recipient yet from Wendy in massaging me in that 'perfect area'. But now what you're mentioned above it's like a new mission for me to see how far will Wendy go, looking forward to the challenge... Thanks again

Nice one TheBigM,  

You know, Fiona knows her stuff and I reckon she has pulled many miles over the years. But she's a harder nut these days with a no nonsense attitude. I had a prodigal return there about 12 months ago. And I've see. Wendy over a dozen times. I reckon it was around tackle six when she warmed up to the idea of making me reach the end game. What I'm saying is that it took time, and of course, $...

I got Wendy's number somewhere. I believe she works at a certified RNT. So i asked it from her to coordinate. But she would never tell me where this other joint was. She didn't want us to deviate from our routine. Funny lady. Great massage!

I've had my dash. It's on you now...

Memories....Haven't seen Fiona in at least a year and last time was only for a chat ,lovely lady. Previous to that 3 or 4 years ago she would massage me in the front room in a tight red dress and I would fondle those lovely cans, slip her out of the dress and feast on that shaved pussy whilst she flooded the floor. Ah memories!!!!!
Great HJ to so i might have to stop by this week and say hello again.

Did anyone else have any good extra experiences from the other girls that worked here?

 I am curious , I just went here once and it was alright. Good service, but I always assumed that it was a traditional massage only place so I didn't ask.
 I always wondered a bit about the couple of rooms they said they had upstairs though,, for beauty facials ? hmm interesting, the imagination runs riot.

Date of Visit : 18/05/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 191 Burwood Rd, Burwood, NSW   Ph 02 9745 6680   

Hours of Business : 10:00am to 9:00pm 6 Days a week (think Tuesday is non trading day)  

Rates :	 minutes - $105

Age :  :Mid 40's

Size/shape : C-D cup breast, size 12 perhaps..

Nationality or Ethnicity :  Chinese

Services Provided : Just Massage (you may expect some pain..) 

Value for money/recommend? :  I would say yes..


My experience/comments :

Punters, if you like a firm to hard massage to settle your hardened knots and you can take some pain along the way, then I totally recommend Amy.

First up front, you will not get any extras with Amy (even though she probably had run an up a few HJ's in her younger years) you can ask, but I'm pretty sure your request will be declined. 

I have had at least a dozen massages from Amy and at all times I left the joint like I have been belted with a baseball over my body. But  please don't be discouraged, you see Amy believes that with 'no pain', then your massage sessions will be a waste of time and money.

Amy is so experience in her field, she will examine your body (back and front) and detect where your body knots are currently hiding, and then it will be time to feel the discomfort!

Of course, it will not be over the top excruciating pain, but you will feel it, let it she is massaging your shoulders, forearms, upper and lower back, thighs and legs. She may focus  for a while in the areas where there are stubborn knots to be worked on, at times you will need her to 'ease off' as she has no limitations, I'm pretty sure she kinds of gets a kick in seeing my face all shriveled up in holding in my burst of agony..

If needed, she will massage intensely on your bum cheeks (if you ask her) and oh boy, can she work them to a fine art, it does feel awesome..

I tell you, after minutes of relative torture, you will feel the difference. In particular the next day, is like you are 18 all over again..

Now, there were a few sessions where Amy will massage me nude when I turn over on my back, (currently she doesn't bother putting a towel on my back when I'm playing  on my front) and she will slide her hands in my crouch area where your ball sac will be brushed along the way more than once.
Amy speaks good English, has a sense of humour, and always delightful for a chat. Amy will also recommend stretching exercises to suit the areas the areas of your body that needs it the most.

But this is all depends what mood is she is on the day. After the massage, she will wipe your front and back with hot towels, she can be cheeky at times  (while I'm laying nude on my back)as she wipes my erected penis more than once while she giggles to my face. 

I totally recommend Amy if you are in desperate need of a firm, hard massage if your body is in need of a good ironing out.

Amy works Thursday and Saturdays. And sometimes Sunday's from after 2:00pm. Best if you book in advance with the Mamasan (Fiona).

For anyone who is interested, there is a new Chinese ML called Lisa (early to mid 40's) that will provide  hand relief. Lisa works on Mondays and Wednesdays only. Massage is a 7/10 , HJ is pretty much the same rating, but pleasant. I was allowed to have my fingers go under her clothes to feel her breasts and her crouch area but, finger insertion was a no no..

Paid $20 for the extras, she was happy with this transaction amount. If you are frequent visitor to his establishment, and would like to reminisce how this joint used to be, take a 'punt' on Lisa !  However, I'm not too sure if the Mamasan is aware of this arrangement, so I guess it's best to get in now until she finds out what really happens behind the closed door. Or maybe Fiona is totally aware and might be going back how this joint was operating previously. Maybe business is tough at the moment and she is looking for more clients, it is quite competitive in the massage world at the moment..  

Good Luck

Received an interesting txt the other day from Fiona (Mamasan) advising me that she will be able to do me a massage on Sundays. Apparently, this joint has stopped trading on Sundays for a while now, and it has been at least 10 weeks since my last visit. Looks like she will only accept planned massage sessions on the day when this joint is closed for trading. Hmm, I wonder what she is up to, thinking it will be only me and her in the shop for the duration. So, l replied back to book for a massage session on this coming Sunday night. Will provide feedback after..

This place is definitely one of my favourites, has proper and clean massage facilities. Shame that most of the girls (including Fiona) working always leave you with the feeling that of wanting more (most provide legit).
I've asked Fiona twice about "extras?" and have been knocked backed on both occasions, maybe third time is a charm? lol. She isnt the most attractive lady, but she has a milf like quality that always gives me a boner during the massage lol

Hey Bluey08, to answer your 'texting list' question, I was quite a regular at this joint. For a 4 month period I was a weekly visitor. I then stopped going here for the same reason as you kind of mentioned above, I was also feeling in wanting more after a massage session. Actually, just thinking about it, I am not that certain that Fiona will still be partial for any extras, (unlike the good old days). Most probably she will operate as a legit establishment until her lease expires. She has previously mentioned to me how business these days can be tough as there is so much competition around, maybe she is trying to get her MIA cliental back. Although, I don't mind her massages and she is great for a nice chat. Let's see what happens...

From a previous post of mine in this thread, I did mention of a middle age Chinese MILF called Lisa that did provide HJ's, although, her HJ technique was nothing to gloat about and her massages were only average. Not too sure of she still works there, maybe you can inquiry for a booking. 

Good Luck..

So, I rocked up on time yesterday, entered from the back entrance ( as I was driving past, the front door was closed and the 'close' sign was visible). Fiona greeted me and we had a few minutes to chat, then straight to the massage. But just only massage, no hint of any extras. That was it, had another lovely chat with Fiona post massage and went on my way. Wasn't too concerned nothing else was an offer, happy with the massage I received and like always, great to catch up with Fiona with the latest gossip. Will probably not become a frequent visit any more, although I always enjoyed a massage here, would prefer to spend my Sunday nights at an establishment where I can get more...and more...

Rates : $65 per hour, $135 for 2 hours

Age : more like mid 40s

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

I've been a regular here for some time and usually enjoy Wendy's excellent massages and her favours.  

Then things changed. Well, management changed. Long-time owner Fiona had to go back to China to some emergency and sold the shop to Lisa.  Lisa was a former employee who used to tug me back in the day for the usual $20. 

Lisa's massage is more or less middle of the road but she can get excited and pop a boob or both out and let you play with her cat. Nowadays she's the owner and making changes. For instance, this shop now opens on Tuesday's ( though If you asked Wendy, Lisa is making all the wrong choices and sending the place broke. I reckon Wendy is bitter that Fiona didn't sell her the shop. Wendy and Lisa are like Ali & Frazier). 

Over the last few weeks Lisa has been bringing her own crew and pushing Fiona's prudes out. There are many new faces but I feel most are on trial before Lisa settles on a steady crew.  Most are up for a tug (and who knows what else?). I reckon this place will return to a full-on RNT before long. 

Last Sunday, on my way to ANZ stadium for the big game I stopped by and saw Coco. She was new. 

Coco is a definite MILF. She's well groomed and wears her hair long and beautifully straight. She might be on the wrong side of 40 but gee she has a fine fullish figure with all the right curves. She also has an excellent butt, impressive rack and cheeky smile. Coco is short but sexy. 

The massage at this place is generally good. The older Chinese birds are generally more adventurous (so avoid Fiona's younger Thai girls). Coco is good and fun. 

You can tell Coco has experience. I tried to engage her in conversation but her English isn't great. I think she used to own a massage place in Sydney which she gave up for an extended stay in China. She has recently returned and is starting again. She's not bitter and in fact very friendly. I did my usual "signal to pressure points" routine and she responded with: "oh don't worry, I massage everywhere". That gave me wood. Giving me wood now!

Take it from me, there was plenty of playful touching and flirting which only intensified on the flip. Coco surely wanted to avoid misunderstanding and motioned with her hand if I was interested in a tug. She won't need to in future. Her technique was excellent and paid attention to all the major cuts; shaft, nuts, head, etc. 

Now, it was only her 2nd day in and maybe she was a little rusty but she's the real deal. Who knows what will happen next but I'm going to make sure I stay close to this lady and follow her wherever she goes. 

I tipped her $20 and was happy with that. 

At this stage Coco works on Saturday & Sunday (though possibly on Thursdays)

I'll be back!

Just a note to fellow punters - when I visited here recently for the first time I was quoted $35 half hour and $60 for the hour. However despite pulling my wallet out I wasn't asked to pay for the hour up front, which I thought was a little odd at the time. After the massage I was asked for $65, which I paid after querying it with who I assume was the boss. So maybe make sure you pay up front.

What lost me was the boss (I assume Lisa) came out and insisted on the $65 rather than just accepting the $60 which would have been good customer service. I must admit my temper got the better of me and I called up the boss later and gave her a serve over the phone. I'd like to be able to say it was a misunderstanding but I don't think so- I know what I was told when I arrived.

Sorry to hear Slarty. As I've said before, I've been a regular here for some years. Fiona (previous mamasan) set the prices @ $65 for the hour. Lisa is the new owner and alas, mistake prone. There are many new faces here and service is still finding its feet. 

I know most of the girls and I'm sure didn't mean offence. And yes, I agree that Lisa (or whoever that was) should've just copped the discount. 

Anyway, I've been enjoying the new faces and grinning through the many and some times clunky changes...

It was Coco and she was fine, as described in the previous review. Unfortunately it was all undone by the episode at the end. The lady that quoted me the price at the beginning was the same lady that came out at the end when I queried the price (I think this was Lisa). Unfortunately she made the excuse that the Boss who had gone to China set the prices, which appears to be untrue based on earlier posts here (Lisa has bought the business). So I knew right away that the truth was being stretched a bit.

The way H_T describes this Coco got my blood on the the boil so I phoned on Saturday and Sunday hoping to make an appointment with her but got the usual run-around both times  -  like "try another girl"  "all girls here good"  but no direct response re Coco.  Maybe she has moved on already.  If I knew where she had a shop in Sydney before I would check it out as she sounds like 'my kind of woman'

Hey wgrant, Coco works tomorrow. Lisa told me. She loves it when you giver her encouragement and if you're nice to her. She is very cheeky but she's very warm. She used to be a mamasan in a previous life and is currently scouting for potential shops up north. 

Enjoy the massage!

I've seen Coco several times and she never disappoints. She's kinda flirty now which she knows I love because I tell her so. Coco knows how to please. 

So it'd been a quiet day so Coco asked if I was interested in asking another ML, Lucy to join us. I says SURE!

While on my front, the massage was all legit, good and straight forward. 

Upon the flip things got interesting as Coco was trying to teach Lucy what to do with a cock and knob. This brothers, was a lot of fun. 

Lucy was a bit too shy unfortunately and despite Coco's urging, she didn't want to get herself going. I actually think she wanted to but felt embarrassed about how she would look to Coco.  Coco was more matter of fact given she had built rapport with me and she likes to enjoy her work. What great attitude!

Coco kept on saying how lucky I was to have two ladies playing with me and yes, I did feel lucky. At one stage I had Lucy stroking my balls while Coco played with my shaft. But that was too much for Lucy so she ran out. 

Coco finished the job and as she usually does once I blow, she kissed me on the cheek, cleaned me up with a wet towel and watched me dress. 

I tipped Coco $20 and Lucy $10


Happy punting!

After reading some of the positive reviews here about Coco, I decided to make a booking with her. Upon arrival, Lisa ushered me in quickly into a room, so I felt that I needed to make sure that I had a booking with Coco, as she didn't ask any questions when I walked in, she answered in the affirmative and led me into an empty massage room, and said "other girl'' would be coming in soon. In walked in a slim and tallish Chinese ML (different to descriptions above, but it was quite dark in the room), we exchanged greetings and she commenced the massage (her english is quite poor so not much room for small talk, but I didn't exactly rock up looking for a conversation).
I must say Lucy has an excellent massage technique and it is evident in my experience that she has been well trained and practiced by this lady, nearly worth the price of admission by itself imo. She is the only ML that actually massaged my ass cheeks in a therapeutic manner, although it must be said that there was no TT nor did it feel sensual, but thoroughly enjoyable and relaxing. 

At this point the massage was coming to an  end, and on the flip I noticed that there were around 10min left without any signs of a HJ being offered, I decided to just ask, by pointing to my covered nut sacks and giving the universal hand motion. I was however, met with a negative response with her pointing towards the direction of reception insisting that the mama-san may not condone such behavior, I assured her that even Lucy has provided me with hand relief in the past, and after confirming that  she would receive a $20 in return for her efforts she began the HJ. 

Her HJ technique is definitely not experienced as some other ML's but she did listen to instructions, and let me hands wander (tits were off limits) over her clothes.
After ejaculating and being cleaned up with a wet towel, she asked what my name was, so after giving her a 'name' I asked "you're Coco right?" at this point she said "no im Lucy", for a split second i thought she was joking, but I realised that the mama-san had pulled the ol' bait and switch. As I was leaving Lisa, greeted me on my exit and gave me my change, where I stated that I was not happy with having been switched, to which Lisa gave me some gibberish excuse and asked me for my phone no. so she could make sure that I had a booking with Coco this time (adding insult to injury). At this point, I decided to not take it any further, as Lucy provided me with a very good massage and satisfactory HJ, and I did not want to make a huge deal about it, as it may look as though I was unhappy with Lucy, which was definitely not the case, I was just kinda upset that I wasn't at any point notified that the lady I had booked was not there, even on my arrival. Lisa the new mama-san definitely needs to step up her game, she is quite pushy and is not dealing with bookings being switched in the right manner, so I had to leave the place in a less than happy mood.

Would I return? For Lucy yes, but Lisa definitely has 1 strike against her.

My experience/comments :

So after the mama-san's fuck up last time I decided to actually test out the services of the ML that I wanted to see, so I rocked up to this place once again, and asked to see if Coco was working there. A ML who I hadn't seen before made a phone call to Coco and said she will be there in 2 minutes (I thought that was quite fast, and was not sure if the truth was being stretched, but I decided to wait), surprisingly after 2 minutes a lady matching the previous reviews rocked up, and this time I made sure she was Coco before proceeding further (once bitten, twice shy I guess).

Coco has above average English for a typical Asian ML, and was easy to talk to, however her massage was not very therapeutic, but I decided I should reserve my judgement til after part 2 ensued. When asked to turn over (no TT at this point), she didn't bother covering me up at all (always a good sign), and asked if I would like to be jerked off for an extra $20, I was not going to turn this offer down after a mediocre massage (or a great one for that matter lol).

While she proceeded to jerk me off, I began feeling her up a bit, but she kind of flinched and said didn't like being touched on her skin, this kind of ruined the moment as I love having a good grope while I'm being jerked off, but interesting it was ok for me to grope her though her clothes, so I gave her tits a good groping through her top (decent sized I must say), maybe with some rapport she may be willing to pop em' out on further visits.

However, with a mediocre massage and a barely satisfactory HJ, with no sensuality about it, definitely a case of YMMV with Coco, unless advised by fellow punters, I don't think I will be investing funds with this ML to see how far I get, as there are plenty of shops looking to provide a better service for less money.

Would I return? Not to see Coco, but maybe back to this place to see Lucy or another ML.

Value for money/recommend?  Yeah ok..

My word has this establishment have endured some changes since Lisa has taken over the business from Fiona. New street light sign, the adding of the sleazy 'Open Massage' neon light signs, one at the front and one on the 1st floor back window, and a slight change of the reception fittings.

Gees, even the front window room has been incorporated into a massage room, it appears Lisa is turning this into an all out R'NT joint. 

Lisa now does txts me when there is new MLs on her books, I usually do not respond back but this time I was captivated by the lure of one new/young Thai ML that will accommodate more than a massage.

In the recent months, I was being serviced by a cute Thai girl named Annie that provided me a legit but thorough massage, at the same time given me an insane teasing repertoire on my private parts that drove me nuts. However, was quite reluctant to tug me off.


So, back to this new young Thai ML,her name being Nina. Not the prettiest or exotic Thai ML I have come across, however, there is a slight cute angle to her that got me turned on with anticipation in what I was expecting.

After 5 minutes of her remedial massage it didn't take long for me to realize this girl was relatively new to the industry.  After a tedious 10minutes of Remedial, the towel was lowered down to my waist and commenced a better than average oil massage on my back. No great effort in soothing my back muscles, so I requested if she can concentrate more on my lower back, thigs and bum cheeks. To her credit, she did spend a good time and rubbing my bum cheeks and upper thighs. 

That's when I find out a bit more of her, like she has only be in Australia for 8 months, her age being 20 and how she was not looking forward to commence college in the next week.

Back to the massage, not much brushing along my private parts while working on my upper legs, at this stage I was hanging out for the turn over just to find out if Lisa's words will come to fruition

Before the flip over, Nina did provide me with a wet towel wipe down on my back, when I turned over I went straight for the juggler and gave her the tugging sign and she agreed to do the deed for $20.

It started with a slight teasing massage on my lower stomach and then applied oil my shaft and proceeded with a slow build up and with a reasonable tugging motion nut short of being over sexually. 

Touching or slight groping of her behind was allowed but was against for my hand to wander underneath her stretch pants or even her breasts ere out of bounds.

Peculiar thing was while she was tugging me she inquiry further about my background, where do I work and if I lived nearby, of course I answered all questions where possible while I was trying to hold of the release. 

Before too long, the inevitable happened and told her to keep going until I said 'that's it 'and I'm done.

She gave me a good tissue wipe and with a final wet towel wipe down.

Had a few minutes left so after washing her hands she gave me a mediocre head and neck massage. 

Time was up, got dressed, paid the$20 and thanked her for the session. On the way out I paid Lisa for the 1 hour massage and told me Nina works Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays. 

At first Nina was quote shy at the beginning of the session, but kind of opened up later to suggest you might build up a go0d rapport with her with returned visits.

Interesting what other type of employees Lisa can bring on board, however, at the flip of the coin, let's see how this new management style will ask before the council Killjoys lashes on this joint.

My Experiences:

Apologies in advance to Mods and members for giving a 2-in-1 which isn't a euphemism for a threesome. It's just that I didn't see the point in publishing 2 mediocre posts when I could include juicy bits in the one. This is an aberration and will resume normal transmission afterwards. 

So, I've stayed close to Lisa's new old joint. Some of the changes have been painful and I still miss Fiona's finesse and care for her customers. Lisa is more churn and burn. However, I have known Lisa for a while and she lets me try new girls and I've noticed that some come with instructions. Unfortunately her roster is fluid as she also burns through MLs. 

Her regulars seem to be Lucy (CHN), Nina (THAI), Wendy (CHN), Kapuk (THAI). She mentioned she's got an older bird Helen (CHN) whom she's trying out + Jessica (CHN). 

I've tried them all. Lucy's massage is OK but quite through. She also gives a good tug. Lucy has previously been reviewed by others. Wendy is good too but seems to do legits only. Nina's massage is not as good as the previous 2 but her tug is fair -as reviewed earlier. 

Helen's massage is excellent and she'll tell you she's a professional. This means she'll charge you extra for a HJ. But her massage is significantly better than all of them and she'll play with your sac therapeutically. 

Last December, there was a chubby student named Amy. Her massage was average at best and I could tell from the odd feathery touches that she was up for more. We agreed on a $20 HJ. Then she upsold me for FS. That was an additional $50. I should have negotiated better, I know but I was taken aback by the opportunity of a cheeky root @ 191 and full of Christmas cheer, I gave Amy a ride. 

She donned the dom with her mouth which is always a good start. Amy was also a willing and able participant with a big smile on her face. She told me she loved sex. She rode me, I rode her, we doggied. It was fun! 

Amy was very discreet and asked me to keep this from Lisa, which I obliged.  

Amy may not be to everyone's taste or idea of value but she was clean and horny. She also spoke good English and I enjoyed her services. I'd go there again but negotiate better. 

I did espy her once or twice @ 191 but am not sure if she is still on the roster. She used to work Mondays or Thursdays. 

Last week Lisa asked me to try Jessica. She says she's Japanese and closer to 40 than 30. She is short, with short hair, small boobs and kinda chubby. Her English is quite poor but has a ready smile and likes to call you "darling" all the time. Again, her massage was on the average side. 

To be honest, it didn't take long before Jessica whispered she'd nude up for $30...then added: "want sex?". I thought, Happy New Year! We settled on $50 for FS. 

Jessica wasn't as much fun as Amy but once again, she was clean. In her defence it was only week 1 and was at pains for me to be discreet and not tell Lisa. But I'm sure she's in on the joke too. Oh, Jessica did give good head. Better than Amy in any case. Dommed of course.  

As others have said about this place, building rapport does help and Lisa is beginning to understand the value of repeat customers. So I'm sure she whispers where the boundary might be with some punters different to others. 

(I still yearn for Coco as I was working my way into her knickers before she left)

Of course I can only speak for myself as I consider myself a regular. I have been spraying all those rooms (except for that new one by the window!) for some time and spent a few pennies there. Anyway, just wanted to share this with you brothers. 

Happy punting!

Value for money/recommend?  This time, Yes..

Received a text from Lisa yesterday basically daggling the carrot in enticing for another session with Nina.

From the inspiration of HT's last post in breaking the ice to endure not one by two FS sessions at this joint, I thought what the heck, maybe on this occasion I could be more adventurous on the 'extras' department.

On with the session and much with my surprised Nina provided much improvement massage, really putting in the effort in working to ease out my knots from my neck down to my lower back. 

Again, not much flicking of my private parts when it came to massaging my legs, however, on the flip over, there was some signs a sensuality as her fingers were pressing around my groin area which aroused me almost immediately.

I then gave her the same tugging signal and she smiled and the towel was removed and commenced with teasing massage build up around my lower stomach and balls and commence with the tugging on slow repetitions.

Before I could grope her with my hands she told me it was ok if I could touch her, I asked if I could see her naked and she nodded her head but mentioned for a cost of $50.

Of course I agreed, I pulled down her pants and knickers while she was tugging me and noticed her lower body shape was more appealing as I expected.  

Then things got a little bit more interesting, she asked me quietly to allow her to lay on the massage table which in turn I got up and stood watching her spread her legs. Nina had a recently shaved pussy, quite clean and looking quite luscious. 

At this stage I had no idea what she wanted me to do, I partially gave her the what should I do look?
 She pointed her finger to her mouth and then pointed the same finger to her pussy and mentioned softly 'No Sex'..!

Yeah, I took the hint she wanted DATY . so I was standing ¾ down the table, I leaned down started licking her cute young clean pussy that tasted so sweet. I slowly removed her bra and was feeling her hard nipples while I had my tongue in her pussy. 

I flipped her bum on the side and gave her a decent arse rimming and slowly moved my tongue back to her pussy. Stayed there for a while until I raised my head up for a breather. I stuck my finger slowly up her pussy and slowly moving it in and out when not to long I was feeling her pussy juices, she was doing her best not to let out a loud moaning.

I then took the liberty to insert two fingers, went slower this time and after a few good minutes she placed her hand on mine indicating she has had enough.

I asked if she can finish me off with a tug, we directly swapped positions and proceeded to jerk me off until I reached climax.

A pretty good wipe down with tissues first and a detailed wipe with a warm wet towel. 

Time was up, got dressed, paid her the $50 and she gave me a cute kiss on my chick before leaving the room. 

I met Wendy at the front reception probably knowing of the deed that I received with Nina. As the regular punters are aware, Wendy provides an A1 massage with generous time around the groin area but short in delivering a HJ which is just a shame.

Paid Lisa the session and was on my way. A far better session with Nina this time around, perhaps third time lucky I can get a FS, she will certainly be worth exploring in that department.

Think Big..

So I received a text from Lisa yesterday advising of a new Malaysian girl for me to try. I'm a sucker for fresh recruits so I hoofed it to 191. 

I was pleasantly surprised to see Rennie who is indeed Malaysian though of -I assume- Indian ancestry. 

Rennie has a relatively pleasant face with shoulder length wavy hair dyed in light colours. Rennie is a spring chicken compared to the MLs at this joint though I'd say older than Thai Nina. Rennie is built for comfort and has the odd handle here and there but her skin is soft and supple. Rennie also takes care of her appearance, was well groomed and likes to build rapport with her customer. 

I leaned that this was Rennie's first week @ 191 and would be rostered on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Rennie lives in Strathfield and is studying for health and beauty qualifications at Meadowbank TAFE. She also works at a salon in Pendle Hill. Rennie has not long arrived from Malaysia where she earned therapeutic qualifications. 

Rennie was not shy in front of a dangling tackle. I faffed around with my phone due to an inopportune call meaning I rose in the buff from the table. She didn't flinch which is a good sign from a debutant. Anyway...

Rennie's massage technique is sound. She has a good mix of firm and soft strokes and she knows her way around looking for kinks. She didn't slap on too much oil either which is a plus in my book. 

While there wasn't much TT to speak of, this was our first time in her first week so I had no great expectations. Still, Rennie did allow a wandering hand near the groin while oiling my legs. This was also a good sign. 

All this time Rennie never bothered to cover my bare arse. In fact, Rennie had greeted me with a warm wet towel which she used to freshen my perineum. But this is a Lisa legacy and is a nice touch. Pardon the pun. 

I asked for a halfway flip and Rennie obliged. And just as she reached for the oil, she rather politely asked if I'd like a "happy ending". I was stunned and almost felt like she asked me out on a date. She even asked me if it was my first time. I must have looked like a stunned mullet. 

So we quickly agreed on a lobster for the extra and off she went to lather up my balls. This felt great. Then she started to work my shaft with dexterity and confidence. Rennie even smiled and cooed: "this is good for the heart and the brain"...really?

I took long as always but when I blew, Rennie yelped due to the force of my orgasm and the height I reached. I think next time will be better as she gets to know me and my equipment. Rennie even let me grope her here and there over her clothes. Who knows what may be on offer next?

Rennie cleaned me up with tissues and wet towels. When she took my lobster she almost lamented that she was trying to pay her tuition fees. I don't judge. I reckon she also might like to hold a throbber, just quietly. 

I hadn't been massaged by an ML of Indian ancestry before so I enjoyed this on another level. But I also enjoyed Rennie's personality, massage technique and her grip on my shaft. 

I'll definite see Rennie again and hope that working with madwoman Lisa doesn't get too much for her. With luck, Rennie has other strings to her bow and expand her menu in time. 

Rennie works on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. 


Happy punting!

While I haven't posted a review recently for this location, it doesn't mean that I haven't been actively punting here. Merely, that there's been nothing new to report. Until yesterday. 

So I get the daily roster from Loony Lisa. I espy the new name straight away: Sunny. Lisa's response to my query is that Sunny's massage is "powerful", whatever that means. I was intrigued so I had a closer look. 

Compared to all the other older ducks at this joint Sunny presented better. You could tell it was her first day on the roster and had gone through the effort of donning a bit of lippy and tidying herself up. In her younger days she may have even been quite cute, just quietly. My usual cautious 1hr for newbies was trumped for an extended 1.5hrs at 1st sight. I needed more time to work on Sunny. 

Unlike other MLs, Sunny remained in the room while I disrobed. This gave me a softie which soon hardened up as I lay on the bed. You see, Sunny had forgotten to strategically place tissues to soak any pre-cum and so grabbed my shaft, lifted it and completed the manoeuvre without a blink. I knew we were onto something. 

Sunny's English is poor. But her massage technique is sound. I asked for a strong rub and she obliged with long firm strokes. There was just enough oil applied. It took her a while to engage in TT but this was understandable on a first date. When TT arrived, it wasn't plentiful but deliberate and confident. Another tick. 

I learnt that Sunny only works Monday afternoons after English school so don't go expecting to see her often. 

The rest of the massage, prior to the flip went without further escalation. At half time Sunny spent a considerable time cleaning excess oil with hot, wet towels. 

After the flip Sunny asked if "you want hand job?" which I'm sure people next door heard. Maybe she's deaf. Of course I agreed. We also settled on the usual $20. 

At the business end of the massage Sunny did something different. In broken English and hand signals she asked me if I wouldn't mind getting my balls kissed to make me erect. This was in lieu of smothering me in oil. I was more intrigued and agreed. 

Sunny then proceeded to wash me throughly.  After the wash she opened my legs and as promised kissed and licked my balls aplenty. She licked my shaft but avoided the throbbing, leaking tip. 

Her HJ technique was a little strong but can be modulated. 

In the end I blew like Vesuvius.  

I offered a $30 tip but she insisted on $20. Sunny admitted that things should improve as she gets to know me and we build rapport. I will definitely be back Monday arvo to see her. 


Sunny only works Monday afternoons.

Since mad Lisa took over from Fiona the roster here has been as loose as the Australian cricket team. 

Still, I like to stay close in case there's new talent coming through and worth a punt. So far no good. 

Lisa did text me yesterday urging me to try "new beautiful 27 year old May". The last May I punted with was at Sammy's in Ashfield per MB and I got itchy balls. I booked May for an hour. 

Lisa likes to brief the MLs on customer tastes. I don't speak mandarin but I'm sure this is what's taking place before I get in the room. It definitely doesn't sound like pep talk!

Anyway. May is not 27 or even 37 but she's presentable. May wears her hair short and has a few miles on the clock. She looks slimmer than she is once peeled and her legs are meaty and firm but not overly chunky. She likes to wear push up bras which are a size too small but she wants to tell a story and advertise. Can't blame her for that and I've paid for worse here. 

May's massage is solid. Long strokes, plenty of palm and not too much oil. No elbows or knuckles to speak off and she makes good strength of healthy shoulders. No demure delicate flower is she. 

It didn't take long for some TT to alert me of extras being on offer. May was also willing to apply pressure as directed. Her English isn't her best quality but this is par for this course. 

Upon the flip the HJ signal is on offer. I gave her 2 fingers (ie lobster) and she agrees. She reckons for a fitty she'll undress and let me touch. I offer forty. Eventually she accepts. 

When she disrobes I was happy I didn't agree to a pineapple. And like I've said, I've done much worse. May couldn't wait to grab my shaft and massaged my balls firmly and in circular motion. She knew what she was doing. 

May likes to tease with her tits and will let you suck her erect nipples. Then when she gets horny she'll let you play with her wet cat but ask you not to penetrate. She's neat down there and not much bush. 

When I blew I blew hard not because her HJ was wonderful but coz I was pent up. May then used wet towel and mainly tissues to clean me up. 

What I didn't like was that there was a towel on the bed when I got there to cover my modesty (since when?) which she then folded once again for the next punter. You'd think she'd change it, right?

Apparently this was May's first day on the job but I'm not convinced. Would i have her back? Maybe not.  You can decide. 


May only works Mondays. 


Happy punting!

I popped in for a looksee and espied COCO. Her bright eyes and ready smile hooked me from the get-go and agreed with Lisa for an hour session. 

Lisa followed with her usual instructions and off we went. 

Coco speaks little English but makes up for it with engaging personality and friendliness. This makes her even more attractive than she is.  And she's kinda cute too. 

Coco has good massage technique. She starts off with a stroll on your back and then she gets to iron out the kinks with her fingers and elbows. It's not as unpleasant as it sounds and I've had worse over the years. 

All the while you can tell Coco places emphasis on the massage and wants her customers to get value. She doesn't use too much oil either. 

As I said, her English skills aren't great so please be patient. She is cheeky and likes to joke around which is a welcome change for those who visit this joint. 

Coco will also follow instructions or directions and wants to please.  There was good TT along the way. 

Upon the flip she went straight for the shaft and worked it to a nice erection. She was careful to pay attention to all the major pressure points, namely shaft, balls, head. All. 

She then jumped on the table and straddled me and worked me until I blew. I blew hard. 

Coco cleaned me up with nice hot towels and felt very fresh and satisfied. 

Even though we hadn't agreed on a fee she was happy to take what I offered. So I gave her $30. 

This was my 1st session with her and I'll see how far I can get with her. 


Coco only works Thursdays & Fridays


Happy punting!

As you know, I'm a regular at this place.  There have been lots of personnel changes since Lisa took over from Fiona and my default ML has been Wendy.  However, Wendy has been on hols and in need to iron out a few kinks, I reached out to Lisa.  

As always, she had 3 random names to choose from so I texted to find out the youngest one.  She put Coco forward, 26.  This is not the same Coco I saw in January. 


Now in the past, Lisa's 20 somethings have been more like late-30s or mid-40s.  Coco is definitely mid-20s.  It was also her first day @ 191.

At first glance, Coco presents well.  She has long straight, jet black hair and she's quite neat and tidy.  Coco has a lovely smile.

Coco is friendly though her language skills aren't great.  She is happy to have a conversation and will tell you she has recently migrated and is a student.  Massaging helps her make ends meet and meet our ends. 

I lay starkers face-down and Coco asked whether I wanted a towel.  No need for silly things like that.

Coco's massage technique was fair-to-good.  Good pressure, long strokes, not too many ends of fingers poking through and definitely not too much oil.  This girl was no novice in that department and was agreeable to any requests on areas to concentrate on.  There was even a hint of TT just to prepare the punter for the flip.

On the flip she wasted to time to ask whether I wanted oil applied to my navel and the general area.  And that's when the fun begun.

It took no time to get me aroused and there was extra keenness from my old fella.  He wanted to put on a good show for a new ML.
Before I knew, Coco asked if I'd like her to disrobe.  I offered 2 x lobsters.  She asked for a pineapple. I coughed up. 

Coco has a lovely pair of jubblies and she doesn't mind them stroked.  She wore very flimsy red lacy knickers and she didn't mind me getting my fingers into for reconnaissance. 

Coco has a very nice chassis.  There is little wobble apart from her pendulous breasts and she got into the moment getting herself all hot and moist.  She engaged in a little cock-worshipping and with her other hand juggled my balls.

Man, I nearly took out my chin when I blew. 

Coco works Mondays and Tuesdays and I'll see her again for sure.  Let's hope crazy Lisa keeps her.



Happy punting!

Name: Jen

Value for money/recommend?  If you're into big girls. 


I had rare time out last Sunday away from the Leader of the Opposition.  I tried a few of my favourite haunts for a quick hour before noon but everyone was busy in the inner west.

In desperation I reached out to crazy Lisa for solace.  As it turned out, Jen answered the phone and spoke fluent English.  I also sensed a Thai accent and so she "had me at hello".  Jen was also free at that moment.

Jen is indeed Thai and also has more bounce to the ounce.  Jen is of generous proportions and round all over.  She is very-well spoken and a fairly laid-back type of character. Jen had offered to cover me with a towel but I politely declined.  She did not flinch or object.

Jen's massage technique is more Chinese than Thai.  Thai can be rather painful at times but none of that with Jen.  Her soft fat palms feel like pads on your bod which is an added bonus.  There was not much TT to speak of but this was our first date.  In any case, her massage was quite soothing without being therapeutic.

Upon the flip it took Jen a little to offer extras but I promptly accepted.  Jen's tugging was pretty good and worked my length nicely without much forceful yanking.  Jen didn't have any issues with me getting touchy feely but she's well protected by her sizeso I went for her ample bosom and popped the girls out for a squeeze.  We were all friends after all.

Jen worked me to a happy end and she was careful to clean me up with a combination of hot towels and tissues.

Would I see her again?  Well, maybe not as I'm not usually free on Sundays!




Happy punting!

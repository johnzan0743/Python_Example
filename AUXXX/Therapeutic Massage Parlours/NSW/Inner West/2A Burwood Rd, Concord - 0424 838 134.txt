Saw an advert for this place on another site. Claims to have Thai, Japanese and Korean girls at standard RnT prices. I will try to get over this week as it sounds good but anyone got any intel about this place.

Person's Name : Tina

Establishment : River Massage

Date of Visit : 9/4/14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 2A Burwood RD, Concord. 0424 838 134

Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm

Rates : $35/ 30 minutes Extras $50

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : a little plump, nice C? rack

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Nude RnT

Value for money/recommend? : OK

My experience/comments : 

As previously indicated, I saw this place advertised on another site and so I decided to take one for the team. A new venue on my patch is always a matter of interest. Firstly, this place couldn't be more exposed if it tried. Right on the corner of Parramatta Rd and Burwood Rd. The only good thing is that there is nothing to indicate what the place is. Although even for my wife, a number only above the door is seen as a sign of a brothel.

It is up a flight of stairs. First signs are good. Walk into a nice tidy reception area. The rooms themselves have proper walls so privacy is good. There is a shower but you would need to go through reception to get there although I was shown one room which had its own en-suite. Not sure who gets to use that room. After the massage I declined a shower and was wiped down with hot wet towels which I like very much.

My ML today was a Chinese girl called Joanna until she remembered the boss wanted her to call herself Tina. I was attracted to the place by the fact that it advertised as having non-Chinese Asian MLs so I was little disappointed to get a Chinese girl. She was a little plump but pretty enough and very friendly. She made it clear very early that extras were on and asked me about a B2B. I offered $50 which she accepted. The overall session was pretty average. Like most young Chinese woman, she has no idea how to do a B2B. However she allowed me to suck on her breasts and play with her pussy so that was OK. Unfortunately she rushed into the HJ and the sexual part was over far too quickly for my liking. My impression is that she is pretty inexperienced in this kind of massage.However, it turns out that she has worked in shopping centres and did a pretty good back massage for 15 minutes or so. She gave me a couple of light kisses on the lips and made sure I remembered her name and her days.

This place only opened yesterday so it is pretty hard to make any judgement on 1 visit. The basics appear good and it will depend on the quality of the girls. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area to see what is on offer. Very few options in this area that have younger MLs, proper rooms and a shower available. I will return to try some of the other MLs. There is a dedicated receptionist who speaks English well so bookings should be possible.

Thanks for the review brother MB,

it's pretty hard to compare part 2 services when you have experienced so much better else where. So this shop is at the corner of Parra road and Burwood, so it will be a long walk from the train station., hmmm, Burwood is far enough and if train is not convenient than very hard to get there I supposed. Not that Stanmore is that close to the station but Coco usually picks me up at the station if I am training, so no complaints there...........haha

So you got a young girl with a decent body, good attitude but so so services, OK, good to know,

Thanks again for sharing

Cheers

INTERESTING, after the 40 John Street Lidcombe RnT was closed down as the building is being demolished it was interesting that they are still advertising in the local rag as still being at 340 John St so being bored again yesterday I drove over there ringing the RnT at the same time and the owner said they have moved to 7 Burwood Rd Concord. Upon parking I went into 7 Burwood Rd and the old Asian M.L. was dressed in a Pink Uniform came out and advised she was tied up for 1/2 an hour and I did notice a large crumped sign advertising some SPA above the pink building on the corner of Parramatta Rd & Burwood Rd... the full blown whore house @ 14 Burwood Rd is a few shops up the road, only thing is parking is a bugger here

7 Burwood Rd has been there for a year or two at least and as far as I know it is totally legit. That was certainly my experience the one time I went there. Even offers health fund rebates. I think the sign on the other building is for the previous business which I think was a beauty salon which may have offered legit massages as well. However, between 2A, 7 and 14 this area is turning into massage central.

Ah well, we needed to follow up on MASSAGEBOY's visit, so after posting at 2.58pm I decided to visit either 113 Thompson St 5 Dock and see is LuLu the fatty M.L. who doesn't mind the Pork Sword was on or test drive this RnT. As mentioned parking is a real problem with clearways at 3pm so I parked around the corner in front of the Mature P.W.L. Vesna / Maria's house and walked down Burwood Rd and without stopping to look at thr traffic which was buiding up, walked straight into 2A and up the stairs to be greeted by the Receptionist who must have been Tina as described by Massageboy... the stairs are quit dark so you have to be careful and at the top there is one massage room to the right but you walk into the general reception area on the left.... I was shown to one of 3 rooms which was quite nice with walls to the roof and a door that shuts paid the $55 for the hour (1/2 is $35) the other M.L. came in and said "my name is Amy" is very poor English and after lying on the slab, she wanted to place a large towel over my back. Her massage was beaut but there was not one sign of any sexual touching, she didn't even see my Privates as they were covered, her Head Massage was fantastic and I would rate the massage 9/10 then came the "THANKYOU" and it was over and she left the room... I thought W.T.F. but anyway the massage was worth the drive over and I would seek a good RnT wank tomorrow THEN the original girl entered the room as I was dressed and about to leave and she just stood there and smiled, I thought she came in to ask what I thought of the M.L. and I said I thought this joint was going to be a RnT and I was surprised she didn't offer a B2B or a Happy Ending THEN she said she'll do it so we both stripped and I gave her $50 and back on the table for the B2B including ear nibbling nipples up the crack and upon turn over the usual reverse B2B and then the Wank followed by a shower in the bathroom.

Hi Searay,

After reading your review I called 113 Thompson Lane Five Dock today, to see when Lulu was working, but a mamasan who spoke excellent english told me she doesn't work there anymore.

She said she had a younger lady by the name of Katie working there today and she said she was also very busty. 

It was quite funny actually... the mamasan said, "Katie is very busty 100% guaranteed, come and have a look and if it's not true you can yell at me and say "you're a big liar!!!"

I might head over and check out the "100% guaranteed busty" Katie... LOL

In the meantime if anyone knows where Lulu might be working these days, please let me know.

Cheers,

Cato.

Some extra details on top of Searay's post. I saw Amy too last Friday and I can confirm now she does nude HJ.

She is probably late 20's and sadly tits aren't the best quality, soft and a bit saggy. Body is slim with a decent shape though.

Amy gave a decent massage and when I prompted for a hard massage after Part 2, she gave a really good strong massage. Actually loosened the tight areas on my shoulders and back.

Part 2 was quite ordinary, she kept her panties on as it looked like that time of month. I sucked her tits for a while and she got me over eventually. Probably needs a bit more build up and technique.

Paid $50 tip and headed across the road to the pub where they are doing renovations and starting to look quite nice. Might try this combination more often if there is more choice available at this shop.

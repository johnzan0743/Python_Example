Person's Name : Julia

Establishment : Chinese medicine & acupuncture clinic
Suite 1, 151 Burwood Rd, Burwood

Date of Visit : December 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 02 9715 6112

Hours of Business : 10AM till 6 PM (but at times quoted that stays open later)

Rates : $45/60 mins

Age : early 30s

Size/shape : Regular build, decent rack, big nipples.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : So so

My experience/comments : 

Until recently, this business was a legit Chinese medicine place. Then a new papasan replaced the older Chinese couple that operated it. I've been there 3 times now and service is a bit uneven and maybe they're getting their personnel sorted. 

The first time I went in I was served by Ting Ting who offered full service for an additional $50. Unfortunately I couldn't oblige on the day as I was in my way to a sperm count. That's a different story. But rather than do it myself I popped in here to see what changed. That's how I met Ting Ting. 

To be fair, she was short and on the plump side but she had big tits and was reasonably young and attractive. She helped me fire into my little jar and I wish I had been able to pump it into her. By the time I returned she was gone. 

Next was Cici. Older duck with big saggy boobs who nuded up for $30. Her massage was 6/10. Not much technique but she tried to reach meridians and other pain points. She was keen to grab my shaft and play with my balls and get me to commit to a HJ first, then a nudie for $40. I could tell it wasn't gonna be all that great so we settled for $30. 

2 days ago I returned for Julia. Julia has short hair and speaks better English than the other 2 MLs I've seen. Even then, she's still tough to understand. Julia gives a vigorous massage and will grab your shaft at the flip and start yanking from the get-go. While this is OK, it's always better to agree on a price and extras. I was taking too long to climax to I popped her boobs out which ended up costing me another lobster because I was playing with her nipples. Rookie error and should know better. But when an ML grabs hold of your shaft, you know how it goes. Anyways. 

Julia's massage was again middle of the road with nothing special. She's of a regular build and youngish so she's an ok option and so with a $45 for massage + $20 HJ she's ok value. 

I did overhear a "Jasmin" being called on by papasan so you never know, she might be the pick of the bunch. 

This joint uses shared amenities so they'll use towels and tissues to clean you up. Not so great methinks. Greedy papasan has created additional rooms and so you get what you pay for. You do go upstairs from street level which makes this a discreet RNT joint. 

Still, $45 + $20 + possibly more extras may represent value and something else to try while in Burwood. 

Happy punting!

Also saw Julia today after adventures I will describe elsewhere. I generally agree with H_T comments so won't do a full review. I thought her massage was a little better than average for an RnT but  that's all. On  turnover, I grabbed for her bum when she started the sensual stuff. She told me that there was no touching and that it would cost $50 just to take her top off. I wasn't that interested and she really seemed happier with the $20 HJ option. I wouldn't be back to see Julia and given some of the talent in nearby George St, I would prefer to go there. Julia claims the place is very clean and that they change stuff for each customer but after applying quite a lot of oil to me, she cleaned me off with a dry towel. This didn't work and I went home smelling of oil. Not good! Better options around I think but cheap at $45 for the hour.

Just a postscript to yesterday's review. I don't know what oil Julia used when she polished my knob but it has been red and sore ever since. Certainly delayed my return visit to 176 for a couple of days. Beware!

Person's Name : Jasmine

Establishment: Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Clinic


Date of Visit: 04/01/2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink Suite 1, 151 Burwood Rd, Burwood 
Tel: (02) 9715 6112 or mobile 0413 215 382
http://www.atac151.com ( mostly all in Mandarin)

Hours of Business: 7 days a week 10am -6pm  

Rates: 60Mins / $45 + extras

Age: late 20's

Size/shape: size 10, roundish behind, B-C cups, 

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai 

Services Provided : Nude massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend?  Average all round..


I couldn't resist in conjuring a taste to this establishment, besides, all the good lead up work by HT and the follow up post by MB, how I could not venture into a recently discovered Inner west R'n 'T establishment.

So I rocked up without a booking on the Monday afternoon noticed which appears was the mamassan sitting at the reception desk with two ML's sitting on the visitor's couch. One with a Chinese complexion and the other more like a mix Chinese and Thai looking whom was allocated to me, her name happened to be Jasmine. 

I was escorted to one of the private back rooms and opted for the 1 hour special massage for $45 which is quite a reasonable fee. It may well be an 'opening' special, so it will be interesting if this rate will change in the coming months.

So I stripped down and Jasmine commenced an average remedial massage, we got into the introduction conversation and managed to guess she was actually a Thai native, however, not surprised if she had another mix to her background. Also, can speak reasonable English which she will have no problem in prolonging a conversion.

Back to the massage, not much effort in trying to pinpoint my knots, soon the towel was removed and she proceed to apply  the el cheapo baby oil and proceeded with a less than convincing oil massage. At first, not much sensuality to the massage, however, when it came time to work on my thighs and legs there were slight brushing on my private parts which only lasted for a short while.

After approximately 20mins of the oil massage treatment, it was 'flip over' time and by then I was cracking the mandatory stiff when I outright asked her what was on the extra menus. I was offered $50 for a nude massage which of course I accepted.

Off with her clothes, not the hottest body but enough to ensure I will get my sexual thrills. She started with a light massage on my lower stomach which got me in the mood and then oil was applied to my shaft and with a small build up she continued with  kind of a mechanical hand job. 

Unfortunately, I didn't negotiate what were the boundaries when offered a nude HJ, which was my bad as she really didn't take comfort in touching her pussy or even her breasts, damn!

I had to be content to feel her nude arse, I attempted again to have a feel of her breasts but she gave me the cover up with her tugging arm , really dislike that particular motion.

Took me a while to below my load, more of a relief to her than me it was all over, like I could read her mind....' thank goodness it's all friggin' over...!

The clean up wasn't that spectacular, after the tissue wipe I requested if I could get a wet towel clean up which at first was a bit reluctant as she needed to dress herself again to beware the room.  But to her credit she exactly did organise to make this happen and told her my appreciation for the 'additional' wipe down.

Got dressed and paid her the $50, said my goodbyes and left the joint in a jiffy. All up the session only lasted just under 50 minutes.

Not the spectacular punting session to help kick off 2016, but hey, that's punting!

Will I return, probably, if the $45 per hour tariff is still applicable, then why not, will be keen to try a different ML.

The major pro at this establishment is there a closed off separate private rooms, no cubicles in sight that I could notice.

Good Luck to all for 2016!

Nice work TBM! I've been thinking of returning to try Jasmine (what's in a name eh?) so thanks for trying her on for size. I think there's also an older frisky MILF named Jessica who might bear more fruit. 

Last week I have FS @ 191 with a Japanese bird named Jessica (different bird, of course for $60). Reasonable but 1hr massage there is $60...you need to be an economist to derive a value curve.

They are private in a sense but the walls only go up 3/4 of the way and I could here hear everything that was going on next door. Would feel very uncomfortable engaging in anything beyond a HJ in such a situation.

Wow 191 burwood road brings back memories. I fucked Fiona the mamasan there a couple of times before she went straight and wouldn't even offer me a handjob. Buddha has a lot to answer for, off course now she is finding enlightenment in China persueing  her art and religious studies, if that makes her happy great as she was a lovely person Fiona

I couldn't agreed more Sparksy, Fiona is a cool chick If I might say, really down to earth person. Just too bad I never ventured at 191 during the old days, would have loved to do a FS with her, I wish her all the best in her new ventures.

Word on the street is that Coco from 252B Stanmore is working here a couple of days a week as Lola. She does a great massage and an even better HJ so see her if you can.

You are probably right. I thought Coco said 151 but her English is not perfect and I could have misheard. However, I think 191 is groundfloor only and 151 is upstairs. Might to have check next time I see her. Also don't know if there is a fruit store next to 191. Any locals know for sure?

Just caught up on the phone with her for a bit, she works there Tuesday, Thursday and Friday's. She now has her own setup at home but I believe she is only doing that for her regular customers. Best to call her and confirm if you can boom her privately.

Person's Name : Lucy

Establishment : Chinese medicine & acupuncture clinic

Suite 1, 151 Burwood Rd, Burwood

Date of Visit : Sunday 30th Novemeber 2016 

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 02 9715 6112

Hours of Business : 10 - 7pm

Rates : $55 - 60 mins

Age : 45-50

Size/shape : Nice shape, not petite.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, NHJ

Value for money/recommend? : Very keen to please.

My experience/comments : 

It's been a long time since I have been to Burwood and a good friend of mine had recommended that I go to this place if I was ever in the area. Upon arrival aim greeted at the door by Lucy, clearly Lucy is in her late 40s and she is dressing a little younger than that but she still looks pretty good, so I except the guidance to one of the back rooms lay down my cash for 60 minutes and then left to undress.

Lucy returns relatively quickly and instructs me to lie face down to receive my treatment, her demeanour is very playful but not overbearing like some can be. I request a hard massage and receive about 45 minutes of a pretty solid treatment, very enjoyable listen the entire body.

I'm asked to face the ceiling and Lucy suggests that it would be much easier for her to massage if she shared her clothes, we negotiate a pineapple and quicker than you can blink everyone in the room is naked.

Lucy enjoys continually fondling whilst using her free hand in an attempt to convince me she is massaging the front half of my body, soon her working hand joined her other and she is building up the speed. That no barriers anywhere to any access and she seems to really enjoy herself. 10 minutes of this treatment and when done.

This is a fun girl who really engages she's no spring chicken however she certainly knows how to entertain a guy.

Will I return, if I'm in the area and she is on yes, but am not sure that I would go out of my way.

The SeaRay had to take the new car in for it's first service this morning and walked from Five Dock to Burwood only to find most of the shops were not open and to my surprise there was a sign out side offering a $50 massage. The ML was a bit meaty and during the massage she touched my privates and before too long she was semi nude and pulling my Cock for an extra $50

Found myself at this place today. Its interesting as I went in a lady customer was just leaving, so still has some legit customers. Saw Lucy, she is chunky with big tits. Had a very hard massage, she knows what she is doing and can hurt you if you ask for it hard. A pineapple and she had the tits out for a suck, had her period so wouldn't get the pants off so because she new I was a bit pissed off she oiled up her tits and I spanished myself to conclusion and gave her a new pearl necklace.

Cheap and cheerful, clean and she is fun. On the way out Helen introduced herself and said she was Korean ha ha.

Enjoy

"Its interesting as I went in a lady customer was just leaving, so still has some legit customers."

What makes you think that women only ever want legit massages?

I know from conversations with various women friends over the years that women do like to receive erotic massages, but almost always only from female therapists and very rarely from males, which they consider too risky.

Joined in January YES as paid silver but a member since 2012.. So two reviews don't make it a reasonable contribution eh?.. You want respectability and integration into the forum.. Then earn it like every other member on the forum through reviews.. Very simple.. It works both ways..

I having been walking past a small sign for this place for a couple of weeks now. The signs says rebates for all health funds. Finally yesterday I had the opportunity to try it out. Firstly there aren't rebate for all funds, only Medicare. Secondly it is a minimum of one hour for $50. When I went to walk the Boss lady offered me $30 for 30 minutes to try the place out. The woman here all wear a very modest uniform and I was asked to keep my undies on so I was pretty sure no extras were on offer. My ML was a very young and sweet Chinese girl who spoke excellent English. Her massage reflected the 2 or 3 weeks experience she has had in the industry. No extras were offered and I wasn't going to ask one so young and sweet. However she did a fair amount of time massaging the stomach and groin area. I suspect this is one of those places where more might be on offer with certain MLs. I am interested to hear whether anyone has more info on this place. It is basically across from Ashfield Mall. I think it is called Beauticos or something like that. I will go one more time just to see whether any extras are on offer.

Well I was considering a number of massage options for today but as I walked past this place a young and sexy girl in a short black skirt entered this place. This was enough incentive for massageboy. The boss lay is very pushy. She tried to get me to pay $100 for 2 hours with separate girls. I was willing to it for one hour of a double but she wouldn't go for that. I decided today I would take my undies off to make my intentions a bit clearer although I covered myself with a towel. Anyway I had a reasonable massage. The boss seems  to have taught these girls a routine which is quite pleasant. On turnover she didn't bother to cover me and a couple of minutes later she gave me the HJ sign. Her technique was quite good for one so young ( early to mid 20s). I asked if the boss knew about the HJs and she said no but I'd be surprised if this wily old Chinese woman didn't know what's what behind the doors. I suspect that not all girls do this so I wouldn't count this place as an official RnT yet. The place is a beauty shop and hairdresser with quite decent massage spaces. Proper walls but they don't go up to the ceiling so not total privacy.Definitely  worth a visit if you are in the area and want a massage and possible HJ from a pretty young student. BTW I gave her a $20 tip which she was happy enough with.

I am bit obsessed with this shop at the moment. Saw the same girl today as Saturday. Friendlier and more open the 2nd time. As she knew what I was there for she got into some lovely work with the undercarriage before I turned over. I don't think she is as innocent as I first thought. I am hoping I might get her gear off next time. I am deliberately not mentioning names as she is paranoid about the boss and I don't want newbies to come charging in asking for her. Do some research and we'll see what the other girls have to offer. I will be back very soon. Day 5 of punting and still counting!

I went in on Sunday, mid arvo. Saw a young girl call Shawn(!). She was sweet, seemed frisky and did not mind my undertaking a bit of touching. But HJ was neither requested nor  proferred; it was obvious from my lack of attire that I was up for it.
Funny thing happened at the end. The boss knocked on the door and she left without either saying bye or wiping oil off. Boss lady comes in and asks if I want another girl for half an hour / WTF?!  Meanwhile Shawn was already starting in the guy next door.

I asked what time it was- yikes I was running late. Say no, so oily me gets dressed and out of there. Not hugely happy due to the nature of the end. Had hoped for more. Massage was so relaxing that I guess I lost track of time.

Yes it was Shawn I saw the first time and didn't get a HJ but I think with a visit or two she might loosen up. However there are others who definitely do HJs. The boss is certainly money hungry and will try to get you to sign up for extra time. Send me a PM DrBob and I will give the name of the girl to see.

Went back here today thinking to try a new girl but as it happens the same ML from the last visits was there unexpectedly. I was hoping for a little more today but I think the HJ is the limit of her extras. She wouldn't take any clothes off. The boss again tried to make some arrangements that worked for her but not me. No idea of making customers happy. I will probably go back from time to time but I am beyond HJs with no other extras and will stick mostly to places where I know more is on offer. Let's hope that the council doesn't shut this place down like all the other places in Ashfield.

Made it back to here today. Boss told me my usual ML was busy (bullshit I thought). She brought in Mary. A slim, moderately attractive MILF in her late thirties. The massage was the usual style  for this place. OK but not exceptional. No sexy stuff but after turnover she offered a HJ. Mary was a bit shy  and didn't really want to be touched. However, she strikes me as someone who wants a little TLC in her life and might respond to some gentle encouragement. However from my experiences this a place for an average massage and an adequate HJ. Don't go out of your way to come here but a reasonable option if you are in the area.

Work now means that I have very few options during the week so I went back here. The young ones  seem to be disappearing and older MIlFs seem to be the order of the day. Today's was definitely not easy on the eye. However, she did give me a very good massage. I would have been very happy not to have a HJ and I didn't encourage her. However when she offered I was too weak to resist. A competent job but as I left today I told the boss that I want to see some younger women and she promised this for next time. I will give her one more chance but her track record is not good in providing customer service. However, I do find the boss  attractive and might ask her for a massage and see if anything else is on offer. Definitely an RnT but I think she is cautious with new customers given Ashfield Council's approach to RnTs.

Sammy is quite a dish massageboy. I've been frequenting this joint for while and seen a few changes. I agree that Sammy is $ savvy and is building a stable of tuggers. This place started as legit.  "Shawn" was only there for her stu-vac but I got a couple of happy endings from her. She was really innocent and sweet - at first. Coz she gets toey as we all do. She let me do a tactile exam through her clothes. 

Sammy has got a couple of older birds who definitely offer RNT for $20. Kelly will let you pull her bagos out and give them a nibble. She's not much to look at and is definitely not built for speed. But her massage is strong, her stroke is good and her tits are big. Trifecta in my eyes. 

I miss a couple of girls from there. Helen, Kuro and Wendy. Being a long standing customer of theirs, I would get a happy ending for no extra $. Of course, I WAS committing to 2hr massages, but these were always a delight. 

Sammy does give a professional massage but no HJ. 

As Arnie says: I'll be back!

I am quite a regular at this place now. Now that the boss knows me she is far now helpful and doesn't stuff my bookings around. She is definitely trying to get younger woman here and a slightly wider range of services. However, it is really an Rnt. Don't expect much more and you might be surprised occasionally. I won't mention specific names as there is a bit of a turnover and the boss is very suspicious and won't usually accept bookings for a particular ML unless she knows you. Don't go miles out of your way but if you are in Ashfield there is not a lot of choice and this place has pleasant rooms and some pretty girls. Some spaces have walls to the ceiling and some not. $50 for the massage and you pay what you think for other services. No one has asked for a specific price upfront which I personally appreciate. I like the idea they trust me.

I am really over getting mucked around by Mamasans. This woman, Sammy has stuffed my bookings around 3 or 4 times and if it wasn't for the lack of convenient alternatives at the moment I would have already given up on this place. She has steered towards two new girls this week even though I had a definite booking with another ML. Both girls were pretty but they gave poor massages and were very inexperienced in Part 2. There are a couple of pretty young things here who give reasonable service but I am great problems getting to see them. One more chance I think and that's it.

Unless things have changed, as an Anglo, I have never even been able to get a HJ at either of Alice's places.

That's right massageaddict, she is tomboyish. But I never had much luck at Alice's joints with the prettier MLs and she is the only one that offered a tug, which was rather good in direct disproportion to her below average massage. Now at Alice's joints they usually flip you around the 40-45 min mark but I worked out with Melody when to turn me. So I obviously split it into 30min halves. This worked well for me.  As you can also appreciate, I didn't go to Melody for her good looks or conversation or even massage skills, but she gave a nice tug and was compliant to most of my requests. Until she stopped tugging, I felt this represented value. But that's me...

Ashfield is my home town:
287A looks like it may have gone. I've been in Ashfield in the middle of the day, and the doors of 287A are shut, the "Close" sign is up. Maybe it has been following the classic pattern: place plans to close, put on the HJ massages, council moves in (or the licensed competition), doesn't matter - we're out-of-here anyway!
As for Alice round the corner... Been going there for many years. I've seen the comments about having no luck there. Alice knows me, and I don't know what she says to the girls in Chinese, but I never have a problem. Met Julie last week with great nipples, B-cup, short, good English. Started with a reasonable massage, protected sex and CIM for $50 over Alice's $35. But she was nervous of Alice (or maybe the other girls who were outside the door) hearing anything. YMMV.

THIS IS NOT A REVIEW
I tend to punt in unpredictable spurts (pardon the pun), and so - to maintain my silver status while complying with rules about age of reviews, this is NOT A REVIEW. I will place full reviews up soon after 1st July. Since who knows when I will punt next, and I have my 12 for this year, I need to start my clock going for the 12 I need in 2013/4.

So this is one of four oneliners I am posting to provide my fellow punters with some intel.

That's a big call Dr Bob but I do agree that her erotic skills are improving. She runs a bit hot and cold. Sometimes she gives a kiss and a cuddle and other times she is quite standoffish. Her English is very good and she likes to practice it. I am a regular here as I walk past this shop most days. However, beware, Sammy the boss. She constantly fucks my booking around trying to get me to see her new girls. Occasionally there is a good new find but a number of them have been very inexperienced and shy in the HJ department.

MB has had a very mixed weekend of punting. In fact out of 4 very different types of encounters the best was on the home front. I decided to give this place another chance today after a few month's absence. The boss was out and my favourite Jessy, was in charge. She sweet talked me into trying a new girl. I agreed just to be accommodating and the young woman seemed attractive enough. Anyway, her massage was good but I started to get the vibe that this was massage only when the back section went on way too long. Eventually she said OK and I took this mean that it was time to turn over. But in fact she said the hour is up. Not even any massage of the front, definitely no HJ. I was pissed off. Jessica must have realised I would be upset because she came out from her session and told me to come back on Wednesday. I way I feel at the moment there's fat chance of that but she is a sweet young thing. I would avoid this place until it can be established that it is still an RnT. In the end, I sent an angry SMS to the boss but I haven't heard back.

Person's Name : Jasmine

Address: 297a Liverpool Rd, Ashfield

Date of Visit :   19/10/13

Hours of Business : Everyday (except Thursdays) 10:00am to 6:30pm     

Rates :	$30/ 30 Minutes   $50/60 Minutes + extras

Age :   Looks like mid to late 20's 

Size/shape : B size cup breast, size (around) 11

Nationality or Ethnicity:  Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend?  Yes

my experience/comments:


This was my forth liaison with Jasmine and undoubtedly the best session thus far.

I am now privileged to have been given the Mamasan's (Sammy) mobile number, however, I was asked not to give out her number as she will prefer to personally pass on her contact number to clients. Sounds strange, but that is how she works, to be honest, I don't believe they have a LAN line registered against this establishment.

Anyway, I booked on Jasmine for a late afternoon session, I was actually approx 15mins late, while I was walking up the stairs  I noticed Sammy staring down at me, I made it to the level and apologized in being late, she just told me. 'I't's okay, no problem..' and whisked me to one of the private rooms. Paid her the $50 for a 1 hour massage and was told Jasmine is 'coming soon'..

After waiting for only 2-3 minutes while lying nude on my front, in come Jasmine and was greeted with a ' Hi, how are you, good to see you again..' Hmm, she has never said that to me on my previous visits, so I'm thinking this could be an interesting session.


Jasmine may not be a real stunner to some, but I do see he a vey cute Chinese girl, always has her back hair all tied up, and with the one piece kind of 'dinner waitress' uniform, she just overall gives me a turn on. She speaks reasonable English and actually doesn't mind a nice delightful conversation.

Like always, there is no towel placed on me, just straight with a short period pressing against my shoulders and back, then on comes on the oil and the start of the oil/remedial massage, Jasmine technique is basically circular motions with a medium strength massage, starting from my neck and working down to my hips.

Shoulder and back massage lasted for 20 minutes, then a good 10-15 minutes concentrating on my hips and bum, while she is in that vicinity, really focusing on my bum cheeks which is so enjoyable. Then her hands slowly moves down my crouch area where flicking my ball sac and penis is the recurrence theme.  

While still lying on my front, I slowly raised my arse which allowed her hands to slide across my lower stomach and slowly sliding on my already erected penis. That is such a nice feeling, I slowly elevated my arse to allow her to give me a cameo 'reverse' tug. Then it was time to flip over.  No leg massage but at that time I couldn't give a flying you know what...

She placed a pillow for head rest and smiled to me asking....'How are feeling....' 'Just Perfect' I replied.

Then a short light stomach massage and with more oil applied to my penis and balls, slowly started with small tugs while her other hand rubbing around my balls and around upper thighs.

The tugging frequencies were increasing which made me really hot and totally enjoying it, this time I was able to take my hand underneath her outfit and was feeing her arse with ease, Although, not a firm waste and bum, but a nice feel, my fingers were not backing out, went straight to the front of her waist and was slightly rubbing my fingers along her 'naughty part', but against her underwear, she didn't back away at all, she actually kind of spread her legs apart a little to allow me continue the rubbing, by the look of her face she didn't mind that at all. Moved my hand up and finally reached her breasts inside her bra, was constantly rubbing my fingers against her nipples, should of stopped with one breast, but just had to feel both, why wouldn't you of course..

Then it was all too much, I gave her slight indication I was about to reach climax then I exploded like it was no tomorrow, awesome moment. She asked me if my girlfriend enjoyed sex with me as I it took me a while to cum, ( which I took as a compliment..). I told her I don't have steady girlfriend but asked you can be my girlfriend if you wouldn't like to be a happy girl..! She just gave me a big smile and told me 'one day maybe..' Sign of a cool girl with a nice sense of humor.

She gave me a complete warm wet towel wipe down (so handy to have a sink in these private rooms) and finished off by washing her hands and giving me a nice head massage for a few minutes and time was up.

Tipped her $30 and she was happy with that, I thanked her for the nice session, she replied with ' see you next time..ok'


While I was leaving, Sammy asked me, 'She is good you think..', I replied, 'if you mean Jasmine, yes she is better than good, make sure you keep her'. I think she got the message.

Jasmine works Sunday to Wednesday, all day. To get the best out Jasmine, be courteous, nice and show a bit of charm, then she will start treating you as Gold.

Think Big..

Date of Visit : 10/11/13

Hours of Business : Everyday (except Thursdays) 10:00am to 6:30pm

Age : Looks like mid to late 20’s 

Size/shape : Hard to say under uniform

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? Fair

I have now been back twice and seen Vinny, the woman who gave me no extras the first time I saw her. I think Sammy has spoken to her and explained how the massage world works. The first time I saw her she gave me a reasonable HJ but moved away and wouldn't let me touch her at all. When I saw her this week she was going to do the same but I pulled me towards her and played with her rear from the outside of her clothes.She gives a surprisingly good HJ for someone obviously new to this but her massages are totally legit until the very end. She is an OK substitute if you can't see Jessica but Jessy is definitely the top choice here. There was some very loud-mouthed Chinese guy in the cubicle next to me who really spoiled the mood for me by speaking at volume 10 during the whole hour (Sunday afternoon in case it is somebody reading this). This place is really the only place in Ashfield where you can get a HJ from a younger woman with your massage if you are not Chinese and therefore can't go to Alice's place.

Dropped in on the off chance yesterday and was told it would be a 20 minute wait for Vinny. I told Sammy that I couldn't wait and suddenly Jasmine was available. I hadn't seen her for months and it was good to see her again. She was a bit standoffish as I hadn't seen her for so long and hadn't left on the best of terms the last time I saw her. However she gave me a very good massage and while her tackle tickle was a bit half-hearted it was still pretty good. She does an excellent HJ and she let me slip my hand under her dress and play with her bum through her panties. I didn't want to push things to far on my first return visit but I think she will warm up with a few more sessions. A good place for youngish Chinese women in Ashfield if you are happy with a HJ and no nude.

I've seen Vinny 3-4 times now, mainly at Sammy's insistence. Sammy's like that. Still, sometimes I do get preferential treatment but this is rare nowadays. Anyway, Vinny, as MB has said is new to the game. At first, she gave me the hardest massage I have received from a female which took me days to get over. So I stopped seeing her. Then Sammy told me to try again and this time she gave me an ordinary HJ. So the last couple of times I've been coaching her on her stroke but also to set the mood by tickling the tackle and Crown Jewels from time to time. Sure, why not just go to Jasmine whom I've been seeing since the days she started and gives excellent service? Well, maybe because there is something rather sexy about mentoring a new ML. Vinny will try most things and that's a bit more fun, even if she lacks confidence or personality. She now also cleans you up much better than before by using wet towels. She'll milk every last drop and give your limp shaft and sac a comprehensive tidy up. 

Vinny is OK for those who like a bit of variety in Ashfield. Personally, I don't think I will see her again and will go back to Jasmine. With her, I get more for less. 

Happy punting.

Value for money/recommend? just a pass mark..

I made a booking with Sammy on Saturday for Jasmine, during my last visit with Jasmine I was able to undo the first two and bottom buttons on her uniform,  had a good view of her nice breasts and a glimpse of her snatch while she was jerking me off.  

So, I arrived on time and walked upstairs and was greeted by Jasmine as she was talking on her phone.  She then pointed to the ready open room and quickly left the conversation and muttered to me to wait in the room.

Then behold, Vinny came in the room, damn! I couldn't be bothered to tell her that I actually booked for Jasmine as I thought in this quick instance that Sammy had purposely intervened in my selection of choice. Thanks Sammy!

Vinny does provide a reasonable massage, although not as erotic as Jasmine but I'm sure with more guidance from seasoned punters, she will lean quick. On the flip over, she quickly massaged my legs, then applied more oil on her hands and went straight to massaging my shaft,, then the tugging commenced. Nothing to boast about, it was pretty mechanical while she was keeping a straight face. Time was almost up and I directed her to place one hand on my balls and rubbing which eventually helped me to get over the line.

Will admit, she done an excellent job in wiping me down with wet towels and then with a dry hand towel. Gave her $30 for the HJ, and thanked me nicely.

Vinny left the room and then Sammy entered, she apologised for selecting a different ML and explained to me how Vinny needs to get more experience as she was relatively new and needed the practise. So then I mentioned that next time if I don't get the ML I booked for, I will be turning back and walking down the stairs, she gave me a vague look and said' Ok ,don't worry, next time I will look after you.."

I would hope so..

my experience/comments:

Messaged Sammy for an appointment with Jasmine today and went I got there I was surprised she had actually honoured the booking and Jasmine (rather than Vinny) was waiting for me. Jasmine was all smiles and glad to see me. A good start. She is quite vivacious when in a good mood and we had a good conversation and laugh during the massage. Her massage skills are competent rather than great but I am happy with that. She does some good teasing before turnover and today I massaged her pussy on the outside of her panties and undid her top buttons and played with her breasts. She actually seemed to be quite enjoying the attention. A better than average HJ was given.. I am still taking it relatively slowly with Jessie as I don't want to freak her out but I think she will loosen up more with time. She was very friendly at the finish and let me give her a quick kiss and encouraged me to return. Sammy made her cut the session 5 minutes or so to accommodate another customer and she apologised for this week. This place has potential but it is a genuine RnT rather than anything more. Some returns if you are slow and careful.

I went here yesterday without booking as Sammy is away. Hoped to see Jessy but Vinny came out and i didn't have the heart to ask for Jessy who may have been busy anyway. All I want to add is that I decided to take the advice of other punters and give her some tips on erotic massages. Got her to do the feathery touch before turnover and showed her how to 'accidentally' touch the gear while massaging the legs on the front. This added greatly to my arousal this time and she also allowed me for the first time to feel around her bum under her dress. I think with slow and careful steps she will allow more. I enjoyed my HJ and blew with great force. I am hoping that in a visit or two she will be a worthy substitute for Jessy who is getting hard to see. BTW, Sammy told me she can't receipt for my health fund but a check on their website lists her name. I think she may just be too lazy to bother. I will ask her about this when she returns.

Not sure when she's getting back but I think it another week or so. Jessica seems to be in charge for the meantime but I have no other contact number for the shop than Sammy's mobile which she said she won't answer while she is away.

I know there are only a small number of members interested in this place (and you guys know who you are) but I will report anyway. Messaged Sammy today to make an appointment with Jessica but she was busy for the next 3 hours (according to Sammy) and she offered Vinny. As I had given Vinny a bit of a lesson last time I was happy enough to see if she had improved her erotic skills. I must say her straight massage skills are good. Probably better than Jessica's. Some days she makes a bit of an effort to speak English but not today which was OK by me. So anyway towards the end of the back massage she started to do the soft sexy touch as I taught her and I then directed her hand underneath to play with the tackle which she was happy to do. On turnover she gave me a leg massage/stomach massage with some touching which I had also shown her. She allowed fairly free roaming under her dress over her knickers but said no when I tried to touch her breasts on the outside of the uniform. Still a way to go with Vinny but some steady progress and a reasonable substitute for Jessica. Can you other visitors to this place let me know how you are going either through review or PM?

My Comments/Experience: I too have been coaching Vinny as a fallback to Jasmin. I'm a regular at this place and Sammy has for long periods only had a one horse stable. Always good, but no variety. With Vinny she's found a stayer who needed a good whisperer or two. MB has been one and I count myself as part of the coaching staff. 

In short, Vinny is happy to learn. Sammy too has been keen to keep her busy and like MB I have had her rammed down my throat of late instead of Jasmin. I haven't protested too much as I do enjoy Vinny's straight massage and my enjoyment with Jasmin had plateaued. Vinny likes to play a little game where she, as the unsuspecting masseuse- attends to her customer's request to soothe an ailment. "It hurts here", I may cry..."where, here?" She might respond, and on we go until she lands the spot...and the. all goes quiet for a while. All understated but effective. This is where it's a bit more fun than going with Jasmin. 

I agree Vinny is hard to talk to but I think she's still coming to grips with it all. Pun intended. 

PS: Recently I'd been getting funny looks from Jasmin and I had deliberately returned to Vinny. Until last Friday. Late in the afternoon, Jasmin gave me one of her best massages and sensual HJs I remember. She was obviously happy to get one tip up on Vinny and was happy to share that joy with me. It all started when she asked me if I noticed she lost weight. To me this was an invitation to feel her thigh and let my fingers do the walking until they found her cat. Nice! Jasmin asked if I'd book with her next. Maybe eh? Vinny was kind of surprised when she saw me leaving Jasmin with a grin on my dial and I may brush her for a bit to see if she tries harder for that tip.

I won't do a full review on Vinny as there are already a couple of recent ones. Vinnie is a pleasant and polite southern chinese lady who does a good massage. I'll definitely be back primarily for the massage and chat. 

The place itself has a decent fit out and private massage rooms. Sound proofing is a bit lacking but otherwise ok. The first impressions of the mamasan were not good, seems a bit pushy and not very friendly. Could drive customers away IMHO.

I'd recommend this place if you like shops where the focus is a bit more on the massage.

I must be in Sammy's good books because I rang this morning to book Jessica at 4.15 and was told she was already booked. A couple of hours later I got a message to say the booking had been changed. i felt bad but I was very keen to see her. Didn't get much further than last time but I did get her dress up but not her pants down. Was it you H_T who got moved. Apologies if it was. I slung Jessica a $50 CNY tip so hopefully I can push her a bit further next time. Vinny looked disappointed I didn't choose her. It is a bit difficult in these small places with competitive MLs.

Haha. Nice work MB. I was thinking of dropping in on Sammy and the girls yesty but didn't (was a bit short of $ if I'm honest).  Thank you for being a gentleman nonetheless. 

We know the BigM was roaming around Marrickville after a bum steer in Burwood. So this must have been another hapless punter that got moved. For the record, I couldn't get to Judy's by 4pm as intended so I blew my load on Helen @ South Pacific.

You got that right HT, around this time yesterday I was doing the inner south west to inner west cross country drive, thinking about it, I was glad I did get the bum steer in Burwood, had a quite pleasant time at Lily's establishment. I agree with you, it was a polite gesture by MB to put forward an apology thinking you got duded by Sammy. I'm sure we all have encountered this same predicament with Sammy, more than once...

Anyway, I would like to share my best experience with Jessica so far, it was on Jan 10th, I remember it was darn hot day, I didn't make an appointment with Sammy as I was under the impression that she will still be on holidays. I walked up the stairs and behold there was Sammy at the make up reception. I asked if Jessica was available and she told me that both girls were busy. However, Jessica would be free in 30mins, so I said I will be back then and please ensure to put it down as a formal booking. Sammy asked me why I didn't text her, my replied was that I was in the neighbourhood and I though I will try my luck.

So, after chilling down inside Ashfield Mall, I made my way back and Jessica was there waiting for me, she escorted me into one of the rooms and we carried out the business transaction for a 1 hour session. Now Jessica was not wearing that ridiculous uniform, her dress attire consisted of a decent T-shirt and a black and white skirt which reached halfway down her upper legs. She looked quite sexy to be honest, I think it was mentioned earlier that she might have dropped of some weight, was keen to find out how much exactly she has lost.

Massage then started the usual style and format by Jasmine, lot of teasing around my crouch area facing down and on the flip over. Of course the tugging was delightful, but I don't know if it was the hot weather or the strong coffee I had at the Mall, but I was feeling it may well take time for me to climax. Needed a bit of help, so I managed to place my hand insider her bra, I applied a sensual feel of her breasts which she had no reluctant to move away. Still, no near to reach climax, so I made the big move. Now she had one of those skirts with a elastic around the waist that would hold up her garment waist high,  (sic), had a great view of her knickers, while she kept tugging me, I slowly pushed down her underwear down tom her knees, was able to have a good glance of her snatch and waist. Gees, seeing her in the raw waste down gave me the urge to implode, had my right hand rubbing her arse and moved slowly around the front. I managed to place my fingers on her pussy but short of inserting any fingers, reason why all of a sudden I blew my load!  

While her undies still down, she approached the sink and had, a quick hand wash. That enabled me to have another view of her hot waist, man, awesome sight! She gave me a tissue clean up and right after, she pushed her undies up and adjusted her skirt down, then she proceeded with a wet towel wipe down.

Made a courteous comment to her that she looked over whelming today and to keep looking beautiful. She was appreciated with the compliment and gave her a respected tip for the session.

Peculiar thing was the next week with her I didn't have the time to go further as I reached climax sooner that I expected...damn!

Guys, just a hint, perhaps at your next session with Jasmine, ask her to remove her uniform, maybe that will lead to easy access.

Person's Name : Selina (I think)

Establishment :   Elegance Health and Beauty Saloon

Date of Visit :  22/02/2014

Hours of Business : 6 days, 10:00am to 6:30pm    

Rates :	$50/60 Minutes + $30 for extras

Age :   later 30's to early 40's

Size/shape :    Chubby butt, more towards D cup breasts

Nationality or Ethnicity:  Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, HJ and nipple sucking

Value for money /recommend  Not my choice of ML 



Well, I guess it was my turn to get 'dudded' out of my original appointment, a common occurrence at this establishment. Last Saturday I made a late afternoon appointment with Jasmine. I arrived on time, walked up the stairs and noticed Jasmine was sweeping the floor, she whispered a 'Hello' to me with a demeanour look on her face like trying to tell me I have just been screwed over. So, Sammy escorted me to one of the rooms, paid the cash upfront and she spilled the beans how today another girl will massage me and next time I will be allocated to Jasmine. I wasn't in he mood to question her as I presumed that Vinny will be the selected ML for today.

I waited for at least 5 minutes lying down on the massage table when I heard the door open and I saw Selina (I think that is her name...) walked in...Farken great!

Selina is a late 30's or early 40's Chinese MILF, kind of cubby around her waist and not the prettiest looking face. I've had a massage from Selina before, which was quite good but hell man, I didn't want her damn it. 

Anyway, Selina massaged me well, although she can talk alright, like the Malabar pipes were smashed open. I did request a fair bit of teasing around my crouch area while I was lying on my front, she obliged and on the flip over more of the teasing of the same. 

She started to tug me, honestly, I couldn't really stare at her face, even though she was trying to get eye contact with me, is that face, it's so something I couldn't get around it.

Her tugging technique was on a bit of the sensual part, but needing to cum fast so I can get the hell out of there, I pulled down her blouse and bra and her B cuppers came out, so I sucked those reasonable size nipples profusely until I blew my load.

Like always in this joint, you will get good wipe down with warm hand towels, front and back. I got up, paid her for the extra's and while I was putting on my clothes on, she started to yabber about opening up a similar shop on her own and how she will entice new customers to become regulars and etc, etc, etcit was time for me to do the Harry Holt..

On the way out, I opted to leave form the back exit where I bumped into Jasmine, I told her the next time I will have you or I nothing at allshe smiled and with a softly spoken 'Okay, Yes.' Padded me on my shoulder, gave me a sweet smile and I departed the premises. 'Sigh', what could have been, what could have been...

To be fair, Selina did give me good massage, her best assets are her breasts where I had a good suck on them. Although, while walking back to my car, this whole scenario was beginning to piss me off, thought about in sending Sammy an angry text but eventually I let it go..it just wasn't meant to be for that day.

For the regulars here, please correct me if I didn't get this MLs name right, I couldn't be bothered in asking her name again.

Thank you for the intel Massageboy, that might of explained why I got palmed off to the MILF. I guess most of us will know when a female is under that kind of duress, they can act quite peculiar which is understandable. There is always next time.  Nevertheless, I wouldn't count out Sammy trying out her the same old tricks again.

I did stand my ground once and indicated I would walk. Sammy relented and sent Jessy in a few minutes later. However, Sammy is a tough bitch and it is hard to move her. I know she is trying to spread the work amongst her girls to keep them happy because Jessy is by far the most popular. However, that is her problem and not ours. She certainly needs to develop some better customer relations skills.

It even happens at the best shops (ie switching to smooth the roster and increase income) as I am about to relate. I only tell this story now as enough time has passed plus I believe the girl has left the shop in question.

At another shop (not this one) I made a phone booking of a particular girl based on favourable reviews. Upon arrival the mamasan greets me and says the girl has a headache and maybe wouldn't give the best massage today and would I like to try someone else. I say no problem if the girl is sick I will just go and come back another day. Mamasan says 'hang on I'll check', exits briefly and returns to say 'its ok girl will do your massage' and mamasan shows me to the room.

So after a few minutes the girl comes in, very nice and I'm happy to see her. Only thing is she says 'but I have a booking one hour' so I'm thinking wtf?. I keep calm and say 'no problem if you have been double booked can I speak to the boss I will just come back another day'. Girl goes out for a couple of minutes and returns to say no problem I can massage for you.

Anyway we have the session which was very good and we get on quite well chatting away comfortably. So towards the end I say 'so what happened I know something was going on'. Turns out 5 minutes before I arrived a walk in customer asked to see all the girls, saw mine and insisted on seeing her and no-one else.

Which shop isn't important, suffice to say its one of the better ones in Sydney and the boss lady is usually very good with customer service. Interesting when the boss saw I wasn't going to budge she gave in, but it was hard work....

Well it hasn't taken Sammy long to get up to her old tricks. I booked Jessica today and when I arrived Sammy whisked me into a room and asked me to see a new girl. If it had been Vinny I would have refused but I was a little intrigued by some new blood even though I had been ready to push Jessica beyond all previous limits today. Anyway, Yoga turned out to be pretty much a carbon copy of Jessica except younger so this was a good start. Her massage skills are just average but OK. Absolutely no suggestion of any extras. On turnover, she continued to massage me and avoid little MB. I was worried as I had been here before with Sammy's new girls. Eventually, I guided her hand to the right spot and she commenced a slow and better than average HJ. Surprising for a girl who says she has only been in this business for 3 weeks. She was happy enough to have my hands wandering under her dress and didn't baulk when I touched her breasts over her uniform. I think this girl has real potential so go with the flow if Sammy asks you to try her out. At the end, Sammy told Yoga to leave the room and asked my opinion. I told her I was happy with Yoga's service. This girl could offer real competition to Jessica and that can't be a bad thing. An interesting and welcome development in this place.

I have been busy and busy in Ashfield. I was sorry to see Vinny go as we were starting to have a nice routine going. According to Sammy Vinny's visa ran out and had to leave. But the following week I ran into Vinny at the Auburn fish monger's of all places. She looked quite dishy in her shorts and blouse and looked relaxed. I couldn't speak with her as she clutched a friends toddler. But she did say: "see you next time", which could also be code for "C U N(xt) T(ime)"...

I did try Yoga and was disappointed. I told Sammy that I enjoyed going to her joint because I enjoyed the massage and the girls she had, not just to see a pretty young girl. I haven't been since and she keeps texting me to return. I'm sure I will. Of course, I like Jasmin, but I think we've had enough of each other for a little while. 

Meanwhile I have been back to see Alice around the corner. I have been twice and have had Yuang Yuang, Coco. The first gave me a fair HE for $20 and even stripped off for an additional $10. So I think that this was good value. Coco's massage was better but her HJ was rushed. I think next time she will be better. 

I was surprised to be greeted by Alice with a smile, so maybe business is tough and she saw me as the proverbial prodigal son...now, the massages haven't improved all that much, but at least I can have variety in Ashfield...

Happy Punting!!

I agree H_T that Yoga's massage skills are still a bit weak but she seems to have a good attitude and willingness to learn. I also get the messages from Sammy if I am away for more than a week or so. Do you mind me asking if you are Chinese? Is that how you get action at Alice's place or have you just known her a long time. I t would be so convenient to go there but after 3 past visits with shit massages and no HJ even, I refuse to waste any more money. There are reports of a private Thai woman called Kim  in Enfield on another site and I am thinking of contacting her. Sorry this is more a private message but it is relevant to those who are interested in services in the Ashfield area.

I like Chinese but am not Asian...I was VERY surprised that Alice made allowances for me, and am thankful. Then again the massages were very average and the tugs marginally better, but there are so many girls there that I wanna go through them all...maybe here's a nugget there...I'll write a proper report when I'm there next. I have been thinking about my mate Sammy, but I may end up starkers at Alice's first...

Person's Name : Irene the Fat Bouncy Kelly (FBK)

Establishment: Elegance Health and Beauty Saloon

Address: 287a Liverpool Rd, Ashfield

Date of Visit : 19/4/14

Hours of Business : Everyday (except Thursdays) 10:00am to 6:30pm 

Rates :	$30/ 30 Minutes $50/60 Minutes + extras ($30). HF rebates are available but the price is then $60 for 60 minutes

Age : Irene early 20s, FBK 40s

Size/shape : Slim but hard to say under uniform; FBK fat and bouncy. 

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided : Irene poor massage, FBK Massage, HJ

Value: fair to good 

After spraying the walls at Alice's over the previous weeks, I decided to pay me ole mate Sammy a visit. I booked though didn't specify the girl, so it was an Easter surprise. 

First, I learned that Jasmin or Jessica to some has departed our fair shores to return to China. I didn't get a farewell tug and she will be missed. Then Sammy reverted to her old tricks and asked me to try new girl Irene for 30mins. She also asked me not touch her or do any funny business because she is 'scared'. Has she never seen a cock before, I wonder?

Anyway, the curious in me and me mate's head decided to give this bird a go. Please don't bother. Irene is attractive but I've had farts with more personality, even excusing her for obvious nerves. Her technique is, well, missing and will drown you in oil. I was glad for the 30min to expire. 

Then came in Fat Bouncy Kelly (FBK). I've had her before and knew what I was in for. FBK used all the oil ebbing on my back and didn't need to top up until the flip. FBK's massage is good and firm. She has long strokes and seeks out all the pressure points to release tension. She also loves a chat and may even play a song or 2 on her phone. I don't mind a bit of Muzak even if it's in Chinese. When I started punting here 5 years ago, Sammy used to subscribe to a Muzak channel being tastefully pumped out for her customers. But then Sammy started penny pinching and over-working her girls so out went the music to be replaced by bitching from the MLs. But I digress. 

FBK didn't take long to get to my shaft after agreeing to her usual fee ($20). Instead of a handshake I started fondling her boobs and popped them out for a squeeze. She then lowered them to suckling distance and I had a nice chomp. 

After getting me over the line she cleaned me up with a towel and tissues. She also washed her airbags for the next punter, so you can rest assured that the gal has standards. FBK's tug is pretty good and does the reverse corkscrew like a pro. 

Sammy intimated that Jasmin had to go back to China for 12 months due to her expiring visa. She also mentioned that Yoga was still around, which is good as she's most improved. Sammy has a new bird Yuki who also does 'good massage'. She signalled this by waving a hand in front of her navel. I will book Yuki and post the appropriate review. 

FBK works weekends only. Yoga works 6 days a week. 

Happy punting!!

H_T

Ps, Massage Boy and The Big M will miss Jessie as I will and let's hope Yoga and Yuki have been handed the throbbing baton for them to do justice.

Got that right HT, I also couldn't fit in one last session with Jasmin/Jess which was unfortunate. One of the best sensual hand job you will receive in the inner west for the price you outlay, a nice pleasant girl, she will be sorely missed by her regular cliental. Strange think I heard on Saturday while I was there, yes, I was palmed off to the same MILF I would think that HT encountered, Sammy told me her name was Katie, (maybe she mentioned Kelly..) had her previously, but again, this same MILF mentioned another name. Anyway, FBK or Katie told me that Jasmin/Jess went to China with her husband , yeah that's right, 'husband'. Apparently they have been married for only a month which was all a surprise to me as there was no hint to me previously that she even had a boyfriend. However, it appears that Jasmin/Jess and her husband are planning to return back to Sydney, I doubt if Jasmin/Jess will return back to his hop if she decides to stick with this line of work.

In future, will be demanding to Sammy that I want to allocated a newish ML, tbh, this so called Katie or FBK really does not get me in the mood as she is unattractive to me. Yeah, her massage is good, she give a good HJ, you get a good suck on her tits, but only with your eyes closed when this is all going on, not the pretties looking Chinese MILF around, might sound harsh, but in my opinion, it's true..

Nationality or Ethnicity: Malay-Chinese

Value: pass fail

Curiosity got the better of me and my wallet so I booked Yuki. But this time I limited the damage to an hour session. I didn't take the option to extend 'if she's good'. The truth is, she wasn't. I've had better massages from my car seat. Yuki is young and pretty and has a little more personality than Irene, but that's where it ends. Her language skills are limited and shyness prevents her from engaging her customers. But maybe she dislikes me so perhaps another punter can make a better connection. Good luck with that. 

On the massage side, not much good to mention. Too many knuckles and elbows on your back. She too tends to slap on the oil so strap yourself to the gurney or you'll slide right off. Yuki will accede to requests and spent an inordinate time working on my glutes. This is a standard punter strategy but nothing came from it. I could espy her having a good look at my under-carriage but that was all. The towel she covered me with fell off and I got a bit excited but she covered me again for the flip. 

While on my back I got her to work on my hips and navel but politely refused to head south to my southern head. Banter was also very limited as her language skills were minimal. Again, maybe we just didn't hit it off and perhaps you'll have better luck. 

I was definite that next time it would be Yoga I'd book. No Irene, no FBK and no Yuki. Too bad there's no Jasmin/Jessie and I even miss Vinnie for variety. After seeing Yuki I was so pissed off I hoofed it to Judy's for release. 

Yuki works 6 days a week. 

Happy punting!!

Ps, Massage Boy, that's incredible re Jasmin/Jessie's marital status. Hubby is definitely a very lucky man!

All Good HT. I find it interesting that Sammy's latest recruits(Yuki and to the lesser extend Irene..) did not go along with any extra's, just only massage. I'm a bit perplexed what is Sammy up to, surely she hasn't tone down the additional services that has been on offer. If FBK is the only option if you need a relief, then I will be having seconds thoughts in returning.  

And yes, Judy is a liable option to fall back on, it's  been a while since I've  seen the old gal. My last visit was memorable, one late Saturday afternoon it was only me and Judy in the joint. I was banging her from behind so she could get keep her eyes on the CCTV monitor that was placed near by to watch out for any walk in customers. It was the only position I could bang her as she was the only one working during this time and needed to keep hers eyes glued to the monitor for any reception area activities. Funny, one punter did walk in, must have been a regular as he quickly figured that Judy was in pre occupied in the back room with the door closed. I noticed through the monitor he just waived his hand to the direction of the reception camera and left. I respected that, obviously he understood the current predicament and decided to return another time.

Nice one TBM, alas that punter wasn't me. But I'll be equally as discreet if I walk in and catch you mid-stride. I too got a bit lucky with the old gal some weeks ago as her first customer of the day. Same deal with Juds keeping an eagle eye on the screen. Dom was worn. I noticed that she now has 2 screens diagonally installed, so maybe new positions may be on offer.

Anyone got any recent news on this place.? The last couple of times I have been Sammy has basically ignored me and I have had no text messages for weeks. I have got tired of trying to get Yoga to take some of the gear off what looks like a delicious body. Any of you regulars had any more luck here? I feel sorry to abandon this place as as local RnT but it hasn't been the same since Jessica/Jasmine left.

Fellas, I've been a staunch supporter of this place and even game Sammy a lift to work a couple of weeks ago. However I've had a couple of dud punts there of late and agree with TBM that my days there are numbered. Unless of course Sammy pulls her finger out. 

Yoga is carrying the baton and is a lone hand -pardon the pun after Jasmin eloped. Yoga has a delicious bod and let me play with her big tits though didn't let me get under her bra. I also got to tickle her cat but all too briefly. 

Then I fell victim to Sammy's 'new girl' marketing and got burned. 2 young and cute MLs wilted at the sight of a penis. Then was Chris who showed promise, did plenty of TT but ran out on me coz she was late for a punter in the next room. Probably MB or TBM. 

Worse ever was Coco. She was obese and rude. I've had better massages in a scrum and couldn't wait to get out. That camel's back was seriously strained when she demanded tips upfront. She reckoned this is what 'the boss' told her. So I tucked away my donger and stormed off after 30mins. I texted Sammy that I didn't want to see her again. And I haven't. 

Since then I've been back there over the last 2 weekends to see Iren (not Irene). She's tall for a Chinese gal and is quite cute. Her massage skills are poor but she'll do what you ask her. Her tug is only fair but she seems to enjoy herself. Still, this is not enough for me. 

I used to get privileges with all the MLs there until Jasmin, meaning that my stays were minimum 90mins. But I will cut back to 60 if or when I return as value is no longer apparent. There's more fresh flesh at Alice's and while her girls couldn't massage dough, I know what I'm getting. What I'm not getting at Sammy's is a decent massage and HE to match. Well, only from Yoga but she's understandably in great demand. 

I got a text from Sammy last Friday but told her I was too busy. 

Disappointed.

Thanks H_T. Great report. I also got a text from Sammy on Saturday but I was also busy. I think I will give Yoga one more go and if I can't get a bit more action I will move on. I have got under her bra and felt her lovely melons but she wasn't all that keen. She seems happy with pussy massage as long as it is over her panties. The trouble with this place is that in the colder months they all seem to wear long pants and except for Jasmine, nobody will lower them. I have had limited punting opportunities over the last few weeks because of work commitments buy I will try to get to Sammy's and post a report in the next few days.

Great two posts guys. HT, I can confirm I wasn't the other punter that was waiting on Chris in the next room. However, I would feel pretty pissed off it happened to me, in particular if there was still time left in my session. 

Had only experience Chris one time, I had to pay her Sammy upfront for both the massage fee and the tips for the extras. Then, the hour went passed and she left the room. I was grasping to get some logic what that fark just happened. Then Sammy walked in and asked how she was and I quickly mention she didn't provide the extras. Soon after she brought Chris back into the room and started where she didn't finish. At this time, I was quite aghast what just happened which plainly just spoiled the moment.  It took me a while to blow my load even though Chris gave a decent build up and my two fingers rubbing against her crouch. In total, the additional time was just over 20 minutes, Sammy came into the room and told me I needed to pay for the extra 30mins. It didn't take me long to realize that both Sammy and Chris set me up quite nicely, well, this was my inclination what has just happened. I paid Sammy below the usual 30 minute rate and told her to ask me first upfront if I wanted a longer stay than my usual 1 hour. She just gave me a bemused look.

I went back on Saturday for another session with Yoga. I will admit, I find Yoga very cute and adorable with a combination of a 'girl next door' image for the complete package.

Of course, Sammy couldn't resist in asking me if I would a 90 minute session, I immediate rebuffed that and made it clear that I only had time for 1 hour. She is class our Sammy...

Part 2 was enjoyable, but her limitations with me were much the same with MB and HT. 

I managed to have her take off that ridiculous uniform but not able to convince her to remove her t-shirt. But yeah, what a luscious and enticing body she has, would like dearly to see her nude, don't know if she is the type to ever accommodate this request. Was able to place my fingers underneath her bra and had a quick touch of one of her nipples, but she didn't allow to stick around in that area for long. Was happy or her to tug me off while I was pressing my fingers against her pussy until I reached climax. 

As MB pointed out, it doesn't help now we are entering these winter months. Now MLs are wearing additional layer of clothes which means less easy access to bare skin. 

Overall, this joint will still not warrant me for a weekly visit. Sammy's attitude will need to change to recognise the regulars deserve to be treated accordingly as well paying customers and not to take us for a ride when it suites.


Ahh, yes and Jasmin or Jessica, don't we miss her, now that's no understatement. 

I can clearly remember in the summer, tugging me nicely while I had her pants down, with one hand caressing her breasts and my other hand feeling her wet pussy..don't think these days will ever return now she is married,sigh..!

Sigh indeed fellas. 

The latest is that I gave Sammy one last go earlier in the week. I booked for a morning session at half past the hour with Yoga. 

I got there on time and Yoga ushered me to a room and asked me to wait for 5mins. Considering that this time it was MB or TBM getting over the line, I happily accepted. 

After 20 minutes laying starkers in the dark I packed my full sac and stormed out. To my dismay there I saw Yoga gas-bagging with the rest of the gals. 

Yoga attempted to literally drag me back in but I'm letting go of this joint for a while. I've been spraying those walls for years and expect better treatment for my discerning dollar. 

Sammy called me 3 times and texted me to come back but I'll do on my terms goodness knows when. 

I think Sammy has taken her eye off our balls and latched onto our wallets instead. It's a competitive world out there so we'll let our willies do the walking. 

Come back Jasmin-Jessie!!!

Nice work HT. I have only been to this shop twice. Here is a transcript of my opening exchange with Sammi.

Me:  How much for massage?
Sammi:  $50 one hour!
Me: How much for half hour?
Sammi:  $50 one hour!
Me: How much for half hour?
Sammi:  $50 one hour!
Me: How much for half hour?
Sammi:  $50 one hour!  (if looks could kill....)
Me: (in chinese now)  How much for half hour?
Sammi:  $50 one hour!

after what seemed like ages...

Me: How much for half hour?
Sammi: (after a pause) $30 half hour, you pay now!

Cheers boys

That's quite a story H_T. I don't know know what Sammy is up to unless she really has lost the plot and/or is trying to go straight and pissing off her old customers helps her do this. I will try and return tomorrow or Saturday and if it doesn't work out perhaps we should have a pact to boycott this place for a few months and see how Sammy reacts. It is a pity there is so little choice in Ashfield (especially for those of us who can't get any action at Alice's place). I saw Helen at 298 today and I am very happy to give my business to this shop but occasionally it is nice to have a younger ML.

Rather scarily, as if she is reading my mind or these reviews, Sammy messaged me this morning and asked if I would like a booking. Quick as a flash, I got back  to her and booked Yoga for the afternoon. When I arrived, Yoga was waiting for me and stayed in the room as I got undressed, She is quite friendly with me now and seems to enjoy practising her English. She was wearing a very sexy black dress (with tights unfortunately) and looked amazing. She lets my hands wander around as she is massing my back although I don't push this too far. On turnover, I again asked if I could take down her tights which she politely refused. I don't think she will go much further and as stated in a previous review, it is frustrating in winter when the girls here have layers of clothes on. She did agree that the problem is Sammy is too tight to turn the heating up because of the cost of electricity. I probably will continue to return for the occasional visits as I genuinely like Yoga and can continue to dream of undressing her and seeing that luscious body. I saw Sammy briefly and I got a rather weak smile rather than the very friendly greeting I used to get. A bit of an enigma Sammy. However, I would still like to spend an hour with her in a locked room.

Yeah MB, Sammy texted me this arvo dangling Iren. And yes, while I too want to get stuck into Yoga I think I'll let you boys play among yourselves. I'll endure mediocre rubs @ Alice's for the time being or visit the older chooks @ South Pacific. Please do keep up the updates re Sammy and let's hope she lifts her game. 

Personally, rather than going straight, I think she got too complacent and expected us toey punters to put up with anything she dishes out. With luck she'll turn it around in time. She walked on my back not long ago and gave me a nice back rub filling in for 30mins while Yoga finished off a punter. Sammy knows her stuff and I'd return in a heartbeat if she offered her services. She'd be a goer and agree with you about having her at close quarters in a locked room!


Alice! Here I come!!!

That is interesting HT, Sammy also did txt me yesterday afternoon, it went like this.. ' have new girl..she good..'. Could have been Iren (which I haven't had the pleasure yet..) or perhaps one of the other latest dud recruits as you mentioned in a previous post. Anyway, was out all afternoon/night yesterday so I didn't bother responding.  

Contemplating if I want to go back in the immediate future, really hesitating with all the recent shenanigans that we have been enduring.  Must admit, having the hots for Yoga at the moment,  

Also, I thought it was only me that would dearly like a hour with Sammy even though we have been victims of her fiendish plots. She must have been quite active in this (ML) industry in her younger years, what do you think fellas, worth taking on?  Or have you guys asked and she refused?

Rocked up there on time and Sammy greeted upstairs and was escoted to the first room (from the left).  I made it clear to Sammy I wanted 1 hour only and we made the financial transaction. Right after Yoga comes in practically at the stage when I was removing my shoes. I was met with a quite pleasant greeting and a cute smile. I was just staring at her while I was undressing while she was commenting how this time is early for me from my usual late afternoon sessions and etc

Kind of nice of a atmosphere when you are in the room with the ML while undressing, It seems this is a sign from Yoga when she is feeling comfortable amongst her regular customers. I guess respect and courtesy will eventuate if it's dished out both ways.

I will say Yoga's massage skills will still need improving, not the ML type to venture into the deep tissue skill department, however, she will accommodate if you ask her to focus in the area that requires the needed attention.  Also, her teasing and trickle around my private parts is a work in progress, but she is slowly getting the gist of it, that is where Jess/Jasmin was darn good at, have I mentioned previously how I miss her...?

On the flip over, it got better, massaging the lower stomach and my crouch areas while some decent hand time on my ball sac. Then applying her oily hands on my shaft and slowly greasing it up and proceeded with light tugging for some time. I asked if she could remove her uniform which she obliged.  

She was wearing a white shirt, a tartan like shortish skirt with black stockings, such a sexy look. I manage to unbutton her shirt (just top two buttons and a had a eyeful of her lovely well proportional size breasts. Had a good feel of them as well, but went into resistance mood when trying to get under her bra for a better feel.

Perhaps she might be more lenient over a period of time, I will be happy if I can get a suck of those luscious breasts, however, have a feeling she will stick to her reluctance in removing her panties. Maybe she we will wait until the warmer months as these rooms can get coolish during winter.   

Back to Part2, I manage to get her tugging me with light repetitious for a slowly build up to the inevitable. Her repetitions increased while she was lightly rubbing my balls, hand my fingers pressing against her pussy from the rear.  She got in the mood and slightly bended further which allowed my index finger to lightly penetrate up her pussy while and then she started slowly moving her hips as perhaps enjoying the fingering moment. Although her pants weren't down, she was wearing black stockings which provided a better than of expected feel of her covered pussy, good enough for me at the time. 

I reached climax to the max, I told her to keep going until the end, she didn't disappoint. Very pleasing 'Happy Ending' indeed..

Gave me a warm towel wipe front and back and ended with a quick head message and then it was time. A did reward her with a slightly than higher tip this time which she showed her appreciation.

A really delightful girl, her softly spoken voice just drives me nuts. I like it when you are on your front being massaged and you in a process of a conversation and to ensure she hears you appropriately, she bends down to the level of the table and you are practically talking top her face to face. Sweet thing it is...

It appears I am earning a decent rapport with Yoga, hope it can get better. In saying this, I might fall victim of a bazaar scenario that can't be explained. What happened to HT recently, really was unacceptable.

I guess just live the moments for the time being...

Yoga sounds like a nice girl. I'm not a very pushy customer which probably fits well and I wouldn't mind meeting her. Here's the problem though. This place doesn't have a listed phone number so I can't just ring up and book her. Besides the dragon that runs the place will not want me to see her because Yoga is likely to be busy. If you just walk in she will push you on to the least busy girl. So meeting Yoga may not be worth the effort I'm afraid- I'd have to do a few random visits first.

Thanks for the info guys.

I am thinking that if Sparksy can't get any extras out of a ML then she is a lost cause! I have asked for a massage and I couldn't even get her to do that. She said that only the girls do massages. May depend on how desperate for business she gets.

I have to admit that I am by no means an expert at massage girls BUT what I do know is that girls have their price.  If you think oh well it's going to take 5 visits to get anything and even then it's a maybe just consider plan B where you put that money together and offer it up front to her.  Show her the money in your hand and say 'here is $400 (or whatever the amount is) I want everything and see if she can resist - most can't.   It's similar cash to seeing an escort girl that is probably just as good or better then her anyway but if you really want to be the one to do her then the approach most other guys are using probably isn't going to get you anywhere.  I'm just saying it's worth a try if she is so good.  I might give it a go myself.

I have actually tried this with Yoga. I offered her $50 to take some more clothes off and as it was near the end of the session she said next time. The next time I saw her she made a comment about her not being greedy and she confirmed she wasn't when she refused my request to take down her tights. She may respond to larger offers but I am not sure I want to go down this road. i usually find the slow and steady approach works and if it doesn't I will move on.

Yes its an important thing to remember it is just as much if not more about what the girl is comfortable with as what we want. I remember a young student at Alice's ashfield shop a few years ago (before Alice made it virtually off limits if you are not a native chinese speaker) who never did anything other than massage + happy ending (no clothes off). It was even remarked upon in forums at the time. After seeing her half a dozen times over a very extended time and getting along well with her I asked the question - after a bit of hesitation she did do nude and it was fairly clear she hadn't done it before and said as much. So needless to say I was a gentleman, if she had refused I would not have pushed. She actually blushed, and by the way she was gorgeous .

So yes each to his own I am usually the gently does it kind. Although I daresay Deepimpact's suggestion might work on some ladies.

Haha $50 is not really a big attempt at her, that's just a standard amount.  If she's not greedy and after money then why doesn't she get a job in a restaurant or supermarket or office?  I hope your approach works anyway as she sounds like a special girl

For those who've been following my soap opera with Sammy, here's the latest:

I confronted Sammy and explained her lack of care was the cause for my keeping my distance. In all honesty I had a dud punt at Alice's the other day which is her telling me that I need to go there often or lose privileges. Judy was also a bit loose with my booking so I reluctantly went to Sammy's to say my piece. (Judy seems to have a male 'receptionist' of late who could well be her hubby and may cramp her style). 

To her credit Sammy understood my point and promised to look after her loyal clients better. 

This is not me being a prima donna, or a diva, it's just that in a competitive environment regular punters should be able to call out drops in standards/service. 

She begged me to see Yoga again this week or Iren this weekend. That I'll do. 

Let's hope this helps us regulars. 

Happy punting!

Those regular readers of this thread will know there is a small group of us lusting after more extras from Yoga. While I have had some limited success recently in seeing her breasts and getting her to lower her tights (but not her panties), I am officially giving up on Yoga and probably this shop. She is really too much work and too much money for too little return. I can get get FS from some admittedly older MLs for the same or less money and I know I can get more in the city from MLs of similar ages for roughly the same money. Sammy's insistence on 60 minute sessions is also very restrictive for me as it is hard to spend this much time on the way home. A pity really as I hoped Yoga would develop into a more accommodating ML but fumbling to try and get her tights down today was really the end of me. I am working too and getting too little back. It might be different if her massage skills were better than very basic. I know there may be one or two of you out there having more success but she is no longer working for me. The end of a fairly volatile relationship with Sammy and her girls! I have drawn a line under a few MLs recently and am concentrating on tried and true performers.

I am starting to wonder whether Sammy's new Aussie beau is one of us because since I posted that I have finished with her shop over a month ago I haven't heard a peep from her. I used to get a message once a week.If you are reading this it is time to fess up. You get serious brownie points from me for managing to get into Sammy's knickers.

MB, I can put my hand on my heart and say it's not me.  Actually, it's been over three weeks since Sammy has txt me. This 'No text' policy may be a reoccurring trend for all the regulars here, perhaps Sammy has changed her demeanours some way with her new beau, or plainly she does not give two hoots about 'us' old regulars anymore

I got a text from her a little while ago to try new girl Sophie. I always get sucked in by the scent of fresh flesh but should've remembered that she's had a few duds of late. I will post a proper review though there's nothing to get too excited about...the drought continues...Aussie beau was espied on site but this didn't deter Sammy from barging into the room as I got dressed and have a close look at my shlong for any tell tale signs of happy ending...I did have a softie and she didn't bat an eyelid.

Person's Name : Elisa

Establishment: Elegance Health and Beauty Saloon

Address: 287a Liverpool Rd, Ashfield

Date of Visit :   04/10/14

Hours of Business : Everyday (except Thursdays) 10:00am to 6:30pm

Age :   didn't ask, guessing mid to late 20's 

Size/shape : B size cup breast, size  couldn't tell with that ridiculous uniform she was wearing  I would guess a size 8, about 165cm tall

Value for money/recommend?  Yes

my experience/comments:

It has been like a month since my last session with Yoga. Apparently, what Sammy has been telling me that Yoga is ill and has been battling chest flu. I wish I can believe Sammy if this is the case, or unless Sammy is pulling my left toe where in fact that Yoga is not returning and was working on in finding a worthy ML replacement.

Last Saturday Sammy was trying to entice me to have a session with Kelly, I rebuked that right away and indicated I will wait when Yoga returns back to work. Now, for all you regulars that have endured a session with Kelly, you might agree that I probably made the right decision. Nothing personal with Kelly, she will give you a decent massage, delightful woman, but not a turn on for me, once is enough.

Recently, I actually phoned Sammy and made it clear to me if she was bull sh1tting about Yoga and if fact if she will ever return. Furthermore, I really wanted to know if there is anything medically issues with Yoga as I was beginning to be genuine worried about her well being. Yes, having feelings for a ML is just part of being human

Anyway, on the last Saturday that went passed, before I could text Sammy in asking if Yoga has returned, Sammy beat me to it and mentioned Yoga is still not well but she has a find a recently new replacement called Elisa. In Sammy's own words, her Test message was..' She is very good..I know you will be happy..'

Since I did not go for a punt on the previous night and was feeling toey, I decided to take up Sammy's offer and really test her rightfulness on her latest recruit.

I arrived on time and Sammy escorted to me the first room. I paid her the $50 and asked her if she has any updates on Yoga, she replied she is still recovering from her sickness and she night be back next week. But quickly she reverted back to Elisa insisting.'she will make you feel good..'.

So Sammy left the room, still perplexed if she is not telling me more, anyway, at the instance when I removing my clothes, after a couple of knocks on the door in comes Elisa. I was practically in the nude while I was placing my clothes on the nearby chair. We introduced to ourselves while she had a good look at me while I had a half hard on, she smiled at me and asked me to lay down.

As I mentioned above, couldn't really give a good detailed description of her body shape due to that uniform she was rearing, not tall girl, black shoulder length hair, small kind of eyes , not a show stopper with looks but rather cute.

Then it was time for the massage, no towel placed on my back, was asked if I wanted 'soft, medium or hard' massage. I requested soft to medium and to focus on my lower back, thighs and around upper leg region. She kind of got the message the type of massage I wanted, she oiled me up in the same particular region, proceeded with light massaging and focusing on my bum cheeks which started to arouse me. Then further light stroking up and down on my legs , all of a sudden she moved on with light finger brushing on my private parts that was evident she exactly was aware what I wanted.

We had the interesting ML conversations about her short stay in Australia, been in the country for less than a year and how she is keen to excel with her English studies to eventually work for a far more formidable organization. Her English skills are just ok, however she trying hard not to confuse me with her own English interpretation.

Back here, it was time for the turn over, once I did it didn't take long to reach totally erection. She could not get her eyes off my dick, I mean she was dead set just staring at it and smiling while she was sensually massaging my left leg and brushing my ball sac along the way. Looked kind of weird at first, then she looked towards my face and mentioned how 'it is very handsome..' Was a bit puzzled how to reply, I just mentioned back 'thanks'..If this was part of the act, then it worked as the comment did turn me on. She moved to the other side to work on my right leg and more of the same sensual massaging and this time brushing my penis purposely. She had another good look at my penis and made the same comment how handsome it wasdrove me nuts.

I lifted up my left hand and gave her the 'tugging signal' which reacted with another smile  She placed a little bit of oil around my lower stomach region and proceeded with a  delightful sensual massage around this same region and below my crouch area. In circular motions, she moved back on my lower stomach and while in circular motions purposely brushing my dick along the way and circulating her hands around my ball sac. Really turn on manby the look of my face, she realized she needed to go to full tugging mode. She oiled my dick and commenced with repetitive light tugging while her other hand was massaging my lower stomach.  I guided her other hand on my balls where she immediately got the message to play around that region.

Her tugging increased a notch at the perfect time for me, with my free hand around groping her arse, I worked my way around her pussy region. Then I was purposely pressing my fingers against her pussy which was allowed quite freely. Since this was my first session with Elisa, wasn't too sure if I should asked if she could remove her uniform. So I took the liberty to undo her first two top bottoms so my fingers could get access to her breasts. So from feeling her nice rounded shaped arse, my fingers went inside her bra. Luckily she was wearing a loose t-shirt were access was made easy. While she was still tugging me, I managed to have a good feel both of her nipples. They do get quite hard and quite reasonable in size. However, she was bit reluctant to allow me to take out her breasts out her bra, but managed to get a quick view of one of her breasts while I was having a good feel. 

Unfortunately, I couldn't explore any further as I was reaching climax, gave her a nodding smile to make her aware I was about to cum and I then exploded quite vigorously, she kept going until I asked her to slow down and eventually stopped. Then she rubbed my penis and moved her 'wet' hand down to my lower stomach and proceeded to massage me with my own cum. Only lasted for a short while, but interesting nevertheless. Elisa gave me a pretty good Tissue clean up and just as good with the wet towel front and back wipe.


In a nutshell, awesome punt session with Elisa, on a ratio with her massage, it was like  70% sensually and 30% remedial. Will admit, she made me horny like hell, probably due to the fact I was on heat at the time, most satisfying session indeed.

Although, after paying her the extras and putting my clothes back on, she started to mention to come back next time and when I call in o Sammy to ask for herand a 'don't forget me..' Really don't know which way to take this, my paranoia started to kick in thinking it could be another fiendish ploy by Sammy to have Elisa as my regular ML. or maybe I'm just being pedantic.

Before opening the room door, she gave me a hug and a cute kiss on my cheek and again mentioned ' I see you soon..' I said my good bye to Sammy and opted to leave from the back.

From this punting experience, I would recommend Elisa, in particular of the regulars contemplating for a return visit.

On last note, IMHO, I will still put Yoga in front, really missing her. I will keep bugging Sammy every week until either Yoga returns or Sammy to finally admit her employment here in null void.

Think Big..

Can Sammy's mobile be used by punters to contact this place or is it a private arrangement with her ?

my experience/comments:

I got a similar text from Sammy about a new ML at her joint.  She tried this on recently with a “Jarly” who was in fact “Shirley” whom I’ve had in the past.  Jarly/Shirley had poor massage and tugging skills back then so I gave her a wide berth.  So when this new text came, I asked Sammy to confirm the name of this new ML...her name was Elisa and Sammy urged she was: “very good girl”.  So like TheBigM, I took the bait and hoofed it to 287A...

It was late in the day and I reckon I was their last customer.  Elisa slid into the darkened room as I eased myself onto the gurney and gave me an impish smile.  I knew straight away we were onto something. 

Elisa is of medium build with thick longish black hair.  Her hairstyle can cover a pleasant face if slightly oily complexion.  She has a soft voice, not unlike Yoga and she is very friendly with a ready smile.  Elisa is the type of girl who enjoys her work and doesn’t mind a little bit of banter with her customers.  I agree with TBM that her English skills are a bit lacking, but if she needs to clarify she’s not shy in resting her arm on your back while she gets VERY close to you so she can hear better.  She’s also the type of sensual ML who gives you a long caress from your butt down your leg as she steps away for more oil.  This definitely is a turn on.

Elisa is eager to please and takes little persuading in focusing on your agenda.  “Lower back, please...oh and don’t forget the bum cheeks, thanks!”...that was within 3 minutes...but being our first time, Elisa engaged in some legit massage which wasn’t as good as Jasmin’s but it’s definitely better than Yoga’s.  The regulars will know what I mean...sorry TBM, I never really rated Yoga’s massage skills...anyway...it didn’t take long before Elisa started tickling the ball sac and other more sensitive areas...this was terrific fun.  Little was being said at the time as Elisa knew what we were in for and she was happy to go along with it and have fun with her punter.  Soon she was going the full grope and my donger found an extra inch I didn’t know I had, or thought I’d left behind in Thailand.

I had been careful not to book Elisa for my usual 1.5hrs at Sammy’s, especially since her procession of recent recruits had been terrible.  But I regretted doing so.  On the positive side, the flip came in less than 30 minutes as I couldn’t stand the pain any more...Elisa had felt my discomfort and invited the turn over...as TBM explained, there was a bit of oil applied to the lower stomach and circular, spiral motions ensued towards the navel and groin.  Elisa was careful to only brush my engorged penis and bursting sac.  By this time Elisa’s movements changed and she became ever more enticing and playful...there was plenty of cock worshipping and little exclamations such as “oh it’s beautiful”...my donger has been called many things, but never beautiful...but Elisa sounded like she meant every word...I was going absolutely bananas...

Elisa kept her eye on the clock as well as my cock but this was subtle...she wanted to time my climax perfectly.  So she continued to massage my penis exclusively until I was hurting in delight.  Then, she grabbed my shaft and worked its full length toying with its tight shiny head every so often...then Elisa lifted her stroke rate until I blew like Vesuvius...my goodness, I’m getting aroused just thinking about how hard and how much I blew...even Elisa was surprised at how much volume exploded...but this wasn’t me, fellas.  This was Elisa’s doing...

Elisa gave me a wonderful clean up with a wet towel and even crowed: “very clean”.  She too gave me a peck on the cheek (ie side of the face) and asked me to return soon. 

Let me tell ya, that I will...

Massage Boy, make it the hat trick!?

Hello Fartichoke, I have seen that name on other forums. The original business names was Beautecos, and prior to that some photo studio joint. Who knows, maybe Sammy owes a lot of $$ to the Tax man? The phone number is correct though, as is the address. I think Sammy also has an interest in another beauty joint in Parramatta as I've seen promotional plastic bags with a Parramatta & Ashfield address. Sammy gets around...

I was under the impression this joint has no land line, well that's what Sammy told me a while back. Perhaps this is her new business number although I have never tried ringing it.

I was given privileged to Sammy's personal mobile on my 3rd visit here, at the same time she strongly advised to me not to advertise her mobile number in the public domain.

Quite an odd arrangement, I guess how it works the mamasan will accept walk-in's and after a handful of visits the ML will advise you to make a booking with Sammy directly for a return visit. 

Well, that's kind of how it happened with me, up to this date, not certain if Sammy still wants to advertise her mobile details, perhaps one of the regular guys can or can't confirm the same? Thanks.

Finally had a message from Sammy yesterday. It seems Yoga is back. However I am keen to try the new girl Elisa. It appears  she doesn't work everyday like Yoga. Sammy said she wouldn't be there on Sunday. Probably won't get there today but will post a review next week some time.

Yes you may be right Mr CB. I had a lovely DATY, BBBJ and FS at one of my local Campsie RnTs yesterday and am off to see my favourite ML at 209 Beamish St this afternoon for a dose of the same. All for the same or less I have paid Sammy's girls.

Hello Punters! For those who frequent this joint, here's an update re Elisa. 

As it turns out, Sammy explained to me last week via text that young cock admirer Elisa was on a month-long holiday. 

Then Elisa suddenly materialised and that she was available to book last Friday. 

Apparently Elisa is sick of working for Sammy (I wonder why) and prefers to take her tugging skills towards Chinatown. She would not elaborate where given Sammy's sensitivities. Elisa is likely to only be available for one day a week at Ashfield. 

That Sammy eh?

Interesting Intel HT. The churning out of ML's from this joint tells me that Sammy has no concept of staff retention or simply how to manage staff altogether. Elisa has great potential to be one of a star performer in the whole of the Ashfield scene, can't Sammy see this? The only full time staff remaining I think that provides a Massage and a  tug  are Kelly and Yoga. if Yoga decides to eave, well, there will be a fat chance I will be a non frequent visitor to this merry go round establishment.

Person's Name : Annie



Establishment: Elegance Health and Beauty Saloon



Address: 287a Liverpool Rd, Ashfield



Date of Visit :   26/1/15



Hours of Business : Everyday (except Thursdays) 10:00am to 6:30pm



Rates :$60/60 Minutes + extras



Age :   Very early 20s?



Size/shape : A-cup, size 6, about 155cm tall



Nationality or Ethnicity:  Chinese



Services Provided : Massage, HJ



Value for money/recommend?  Yes



my experience/comments:



I got the usual "new girl, she's good" text from Sammy and I took the bait. It had been some time since I visited any of Sammy's girls and so I dragged my full sac to Ashfield. 

To my surprise I found I hadn't budgeted properly as Sammy had jacked up prices. While this is fair to bring them in line with prices elsewhere, no extra value was on offer. For one, Yoga is still around, teasing MB and the BigM with her big boobs. 

Anyway, it appeared to me fairly early in the piece that Annie was in demand for she was late to our appointment. Given that she's fresh and busier than Yoga, her sessions are plenty and run over time. Be mindful of this as Sammy has no issues in making you wait longer than the 5 she promises. 

Annie is tiny, probably the size of an overgrown sparrow. She's small all over and so there's not much to hold onto. She's quite plain with straight shoulder length hair. Her English isn't that flash but she's not shy. She knows what this is all about. 

If you enjoy a good massage,  Annie is Middle of the road. I've had her twice now and feel that her practice is making perfect as she isn't merely going through the motions. There's purpose in her stroke and some technique but can overuse oil. 

While on your back, and before long, she'll tickle your jewels just so keep you honest and if you ask her, she'll apply good pressure to those nooks and crannies you leave for you favourite MLs. Annie will oblige. 

While working on your legs Annie will build to a nice grope and encourage you to bloom to full wood. On the flip, if this is your first time with her, you may ask her to massage your throbber and agree on the usual $20. 

If Annie knows you, she'll assume you're there for a tug and so she'll massage your front and tease you into perdition. Annie isn't very chatty but she'll look at you and give you a little smile from time to time. As I think that this is her first work experience in a RNT, every new cock holds wonder still, so Annie gets a bit horny grabbing and fondling. She gets close too, almost as if wanting to go the chomp!

As I said, I've seen her twice and her tug is actually quite good. After climax she'll keep stroking you in a feverish manner which can border on the uncomfortable. But still very enjoyable. 

The cleanup is almost non existent so be sure to grab a towel, moisten and do it yourself. The girl in other words is quite green and I'm sure we can help her out with a tip or 2. Pun intended. 

Matter my 2nd visit, Sammy asked that maybe next time I see Yoga, but maybe not. 

Happy punting!!

Like always HT, an excellent and detailed review. I also had a liaison with Anne in early January. However, since I was on holidays at the time I was just too damn lazy in composing a review.

Sammy was bugging me after Christmas about this new girl and was also was receiving her sales pitch texts, ' New Girl, she will be good for you..' and so on, I finally decided to try her out as you could say my regular ML (Yoga) was again on holidays.

Funny when she mentioned the price went up $10 for an hour session, yep, I bet Sammy was waiting in anticipation for the New Year to apply the petty increase.   

Your description on Annie's features and her accommodating services were on the mark, she certainly did shy away in providing a 'creepy crawly' groin rub while lying on my front, that was quite awesome.

However, while it was time for the tugging, I offered Anne $40 top remove all of her clothes and she unreluctantly obliged. Cute body that makes for her A cuppers, had a good feel of her pussy and doesn't she gets close to you while she jerks you off. Actually so close that she received a couple of friendly fire shots on her body, think she wasn't too fazed about it, but yeah, her clean up method does need more attention to detail.

Now that Yoga is back, I'm sticking to what I have been accustomed to with her attributes. It's now gone pass the teasing stage with Yoga, she is really an incredible girl, really falling for her, Oops, wake up TBM, this can't happen..

It seems that Sammy must have given up on me  as I haven't received any messages for many months. Admittedly, I haven't been there for nearly  6 months myself. However, HT's and TBM's report always make me think I should give the place another try but I think I have moved on. I ilke the FS I get in Campsie for the same or less that I have paid at Sammy's joint. However, the thought of Yoga is still enough to get me hot and bothered. Maybe, just maybe...

Person's Name : Jasmine

Establishment: Elegance Health and Beauty Saloon 

Address: 287a Liverpool Rd, Ashfield 

Date of Visit : 11/2/15 

Hours of Business : Everyday (except Thursdays) 10:00am to 6:30pm 

Rates :$60/60 Minutes + extras 

Age : Mid 20s? 

Size/shape : B-cup, size 8 about 165cm tall 

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese 


Services Provided : Massage, HJ 

Value for money/recommend? Yes 

My experience/comments: Yes, she's back! After an 8-month hiatus, Jasmine (aka Jessie) has returned home. 

Sammy's text said it all: "you want to come today? jasmine is back". How could I refuse? Regulars such as MB and TheBigM will know what I'm talking about and the invitation was too good to refuse. 

Now, if I remember correctly, Sammy told me 8 months ago that Jasmine/Jessie was off to China to get hitched. But there was no sign of a ring or mention of any significant other. Jasmine explained that reason she returned was that she missed Aussie. According to her, she found it difficult back home but I'm sure there's more to that story. 

Jasmine's massage is always good but she is definitely a little rusty. Nevertheless she was obliging when prompted where the pressure -or pleasure points were. Regulars must return to help her regain her touch!

Jasmine however is a skilled ML and her strokes are still well balanced. There's just enough amount of pressure to release tension but also light, feathery touches to tease you with. It was a stinking hot day and Jasmine had the good sense to dab her hands in cool water for my comfort. This consideration for her customers has always been one of her assets. 

It took a little longer than usual for any TT to take place but when it did it was as good as I remember. Sensing my stiffness and growing discomfort she invited me to flip and the real fun began. 

Jasmin wore a short skirt and let me run my probing hands up and down her legs. I tried to sneak a finger under her cottontails but was denied that privilege. Maybe not on the first date. 

Upon bursting like Vesuvius, Jasmine cleaned me up well and proper with a cool wet towel due to the infernal heat. 

If you asked me, Jasmin seemed a little subdued and a touch distant. Maybe she was sad about being back, maybe she was just tired. Who knows. Let's hope though that she regains her mojo as her smile can be dazzling and can be quite cheeky when relaxed. Maybe dragon lady Sammy is riding her harder than the customers. 

I didn't see Annie when I went in and Yoga is still here. All in all, 'twas really good to welcome Jasmine/Jessie back. 

Jasmine works 6 days a week except Thursdays. 

Happy punting!

I hope they blame Hottest_Tamale. My regular Campsie MLs, that is,  who I eschewed today in favour of Jessica (prefers Jessy now)

I couldn't resist the urge to return and see Jessica after about a 9 month break. However, pleasant as it was to catch up with her, I think I am now past the sweet, fully-clothed HJ. Especially when it is accompanied by an average massage and costs me $90. For the same price in Campsie I can get FS plus a professional massage with 2 shots.

This not to say that I didn't enjoy my time with Jessy. She was a bit reserved t first but warmed up as we talked about her extensive travels. I did make the mistake of mentioning the marriage and she was defensive and evasive. I quickly moved on to a new topic and she relaxed again.

As mentioned, her massage skills are reasonable but not out of the ordinary. She did tolerate putting my hands all  over her buttocks and legs as the massage progressed and let me play with her pussy over her knickers and with her lovely breasts under her bra. She also a gives a good HJ. I always shudder when she gives me a HJ which is unusual.

At the end, she allowed to give her a hug and a light kiss. I will probably go back from time to time when I don't feel like FS but at the new price of $60, I can't see this place as real value for money in the RnT stakes. However, worth a try.

Gees, talking about putting the old spanner into the workshad a kind off uncanny visit to our dear Sammy's establishment last Saturday. Will admit, my eyes lit up once HT announced that Jessica (or Jessy) has returned back from the land of the famous Five Dynasties. 

Had some awesome sessions with Jessica in the past. Still, my urges weren't enough to book in a session with Jasmine as I am gluing to Yoga quicker than a no name Supa Glue. 

However, my mindset did change a little when it all started last Saturday when I made an afternoon booking with Yoga. As soon as I arrived, Sammy wished me straight to an empty room where I paid her the unjustified $60 for the 1 hour session.

Strange thing was that Sammy was more user friendly to me from previous times. Maybe the fact it was Valentine's Day and she was guaranteed a good banging session from her boyfriend. I was perplexed how she asked me how is work, I have lost some weight (had no idea I was overweight) and apologized to me that Yoga will be a few minutes late as he was finishing with another client.

Then she mentioned if I remembered Jasmine, I said yes, then she told me that she is back from China. I replied back, 'really, that's great....' (Acting I have no idea on her return...). Then she went out of her way to call in Jasmine into the room, when she entered I was given a passable surprised look and straight away she softly grabbed my arm telling ,me I haven't changed at all and how nice to see me again. Gulp! Now, if I could read her straight through, I guess she was trying to tell me....'pick me next time, I am back now. I bet you miss me jerking you off..damn it, I need the more cash I can get..' 

I can tell you know, just seeing her in again (even though she was wearing that unfashionable uniform), as she was standing close to me my flash backs were pounding me like surf crashing against a rock pool, constant and heavy!

Got back to reality and mentioned to her that it was also nice to see you again and will you see you soon. She then grabbed my hand and quietly replied 'Yes....' smiled back to me and walked out the room.

I was left speechless, even though there was no one in the room. Now I don't want to into a boring 'triangle' episode, but that got my juices brewing quickly which was perfect timing to start my session with Yoga.

So, a few minutes later, in comes Yoga, then I was lying on the table, I lifted up my head where she gave a me a nice hug with a sweet ' Happy Valentine's Day'  which sounded so sweet !

Of course, Yoga was looking sexy as ever, but I won't deny I had Jasmine on my mind which I could not shake off.

 So Yoga started with her less than mediocre massage, actually, she slightly getting better, well I think she is, mind you that's after constant reminding on the basic of a remedial message, sad but true.

On the flip side, as usually, Yoga will go directly for my shaft and a pretty good build up, with more oil applied she went for the juggernaut. I helped her remove her uniform and revealed she was wearing a one piece tight outfit that made me aghast, once again..

While she was still tugging me, I lifted up her one piece dress over her bra and manage to squeeze out her luscious breasts. Like always, her nipples were pointed out with distinction, looked down and she was wearing a pair of brief like knickers. My next motive was to take down her panties for a good view but never eventuated, all of a sudden I blew my load which sort of surprise her. She mentioned how this time I released earlier than previous time, and she was right. I did not want to mention to her but it may well have been the 'Jasmine/Jessy' factor could it be true?

Anyway, after the cleanup she gave me a soothing head massage and had a bit of a chat about the true meaning of Valentine's Day, interesting to say the least...

Anyway, that was one hell of interesting visit at Sammy's joint. Would I book in Jasmine/Jessy for a welcome back visit, hard not to say no, although she also works 6 days a week now, just like Yoga, let me dwell on this for a while..

Still not convinced in this joint a price increase is justified, but worth a visit if you like to shoot the breeze if you are in the neighborhood.

Thing Big..

I think my soft spot melted today. I had a bizarre SMS conversation with Sammy today.

It started when she messaged me and asked me if I wanted to visit this afternoon. I messaged back to say I couldn't today but perhaps Wednesday.

I then thought, what I really need from this place is a 30 minute rather than 60 minute session as I am bored with the massages but would be prepaired to go and pay $35 for access to the few minutes of fun.

I sent a message to Sammy saying something like ' a number of customers , like me, would come more often if she offered a 30 minute session for say $35'.

To my surprise she messaged straight back and said 'OK'. So quick as I flash I messaged ' So is Jessie free this afternoon for a 30 minute session?"

Almost as quickly she responded 'We only do 60 minutes massages here?"  WTF, I am thinking.

I responded something like ' Sammy every massage shop in Sydney offers a 30 minute option so you are lucky if business is so good you don't have to do this'.

She responded, without irony, I think 'thank you'

I then thought I would go straight to her heart. (OK Sammy, I will take my money and go to another shop but it is a pity as you are local and convenient for me'.

She replied 'I understand that'.

So I did try and I know that occasionally if you are on the spot and absolutely insist she may allow a 30 minute session but generally it is unavailable.

This will probably be the end of Sammy's for me as at $60 for a mediocre massage and $30 for a clothed-hand job there is much better value around.

I will get my massages at the legit Thai up the road and my FS at Campsie. 

Au revoir Sammy.

Wow. Yeah. Sammy is as subtle as a sledgehammer and cold as a fish. Not a good combination for a mamasan competing in a crowded space. 

I've been getting invitations from Sammy but I just can't bring myself to go back. I've reflected on my last episode with Jasmine and in the cold light of day, when you do your sums, Sammy's business case just doesn't stack up. 

Adieu Sammy!

I'll say. I often go for 30 minutes on the first visit to a shop to try things out. I posted this before in this thread but here's what happened when I visited this shop for the first time.

Me: How much for massage?
Sammi: $50 one hour!
Me: How much for half hour?
Sammi: $50 one hour!
Me: How much for half hour?
Sammi: $50 one hour!
Me: How much for half hour?
Sammi: $50 one hour! (if looks could kill....)
Me: (in chinese now) How much for half hour?
Sammi: $50 one hour!

after what seemed like ages...

Me: How much for half hour?
Sammi: (after a pause) $30 half hour, you pay now!

So I did manage to get the half hour but it was bloody hard work!

So, I thought Ashfield is not far away from Burwood ? Surely a 30 min session with Mimi would trump most of these sessions ?

For all the regulars here who may comprehend where I'm coming from.... After finishing another delightful session with Yoga (well, just the part 2 only..) on the Saturday, I was the last customer of the day and after saying my goodbyes to Yoga and exiting the joint via the back door, I noticed Sammy was dressed up quite smart and admittedly looking quite sensuous. She followed me on the way back and making conversations with a huge smile on her face. I'm pretty sure her recent change of demeanour is relating to her latest beau, he must be doing something right. But I tell you, she looked very 'boneable' at that time. I know I should be thinking the opposite from all of her past shenanigans she not only put on me but with other fellow punters, but always wanted to have a 'closed door' session with Sammy. Still, doesn't change the fact of her unjustification of the recent pay hike, maybe this is why she has been more ' customer user friendly' than previous times. Who knows, I can't still work at this woman.

Hi Mods - I know might sound like a minor change, but any chance please you can modify the establishment name to:  'Elegance Health and Beauty Centre'. Thanks

I often wander past this place and wistfully look up and think of my past sessions with Jessy. However I then think of the $60 for a nondescript massage and $30 for a clothed hand job and head on down to Amy at 295 for 30 minutes of wild sex for $70. Nonetheless, I am interested to see if any of you local lads have any recent Intel about this place that you would like to share publicly or privately. You know who you are!

Hey MB, while it's been a month since I last visited this establishment, not much has changed, basically just ditto..  Massages are still levied by the hour for the cost of $60, as far what I know it's only Jasmine and Yoga are allocated for their below par massages with a semi clothed HE, and I still can't at all work out Sammy. So that's all the intel I have, unless some other local which have in the past have been a frequent visitor (or maybe still is..) can share any juicy gossip..

The regulars here will know that the boss, Sammy, is a witch most of the time and she certainly was this visit. She totally ignored me to the point of rudeness. I had vowed before not to return to this place but I do like Jessy and she does do a memorable HJ.

I hadn't been there for nearly 10 months but Jessica (unlike Sammy) greeted me warmly and seemed happy to see me. She started her usual unexceptional massage and as usual I groped her backside as she stood near me. The good thing about Jessy is that some of our illustrious members have taught her how to tickle tackle and she has learnt this lesson well. This means I am always enormously aroused when I get to turn over. As I hadn't seen her for so long, I didn't push boundaries too far but I managed to pull her knickers partially down and feel her breasts under her bra. She gave me quite a skilled HJ and I had a couple of strong spasms. She does a a slow and meticulous clean up with a hot towel which I enjoy.She also speaks English well and is quite happy to chat if you find topics she is interested in. 

However, I doubt I will be back. I like Jessy but $90 for a mostly clothed and non-descript massage is way too much, even with a good HJ to finish off. Today, I paid $70 for a wild fuck with with an equally sexy young woman a few doors down at 295. If I want a massage in Ashfield, I will go to a legit place and get a real massage and meet my sexual needs somewhere else.

Yeap, with Mimi at Burwood and Amy from Stanmore, you have got all your bases covered! Then if you need to taste the body of a young 20 something for a change, can't go pass Tiffany at 378 either , right ??

Brother MB, we like all the same girls but I envy you with all your times and freedom and flexibility to go far and wide !!

Good on you brother ! Jealous !!

Ps. You may not have read my post in the Northwest! Coco told me she went for a trial in a little shop in a small Aldi shopping centre in Blacktown one day this week and she was pleasantly surprised how busy the shop was and the clients were all nice and gentle , she worked non stop from start to finish and made lots of money, just 30 min massage and $20 HE, some lucky punter paid $50 and couldn't believe their luck when the treasures were unveiled !........haha

Ps. You may not have read my post in the Northwest! Coco told me she went for a trial in a little shop in a small Aldi shopping centre in Blacktown one day this week and she was pleasantly surprised how busy the shop was and the clients were all nice and gentle , she worked non stop from start to finish and made lots of money, just 30 min massage and $20 HE, some lucky punter paid $50 and couldn't believe their luck when the treasures were unveiled !........haha


We certainly do share some of the same  favourites and some of the best in the business as well. I must correct you, though, on the freedom to travel far and wide. As a married man who works very predictable hours, my punts are either highly planned or the result of an expected absence by the mrs. It is now quite hard for me to see Amy but much easier to see Mimi. Although I tried to book her today and she tells me she is having a day off! Tiffany is a rare pleasure.

Yeah, tell me about it brother !!

in additions to all your restrictions, I also have to factor in the two days a week I am to service my lovely Mrs at home !! at my age, it's not hard to figure out what day/s of the week are left for me to have a punt while not affecting my performance at home if you know what I mean............haha - still doing it all on my own without any assistance from pills or other stuff. But I think my days will come very soon, and I have to work this in gradually so that it won't raise any suspicious at home as why I need that ?? where else am I using it ??

The on going challenges from a married man...................lol

Yes sorry. I did realise that these posts were becoming more like PMs and not on the appropriate thread but they were inspired by a genuine review.

Name : Cici 

Establishment: Elegance Health and Beauty Saloon 

Address: 287a Liverpool Rd, Ashfield 

Date of Visit : 17/07/16

Hours of Business : Everyday (except Thursdays) 10:00am to 6:30pm 

Rates :$60/60 Minutes + $50 for nude HJ

Age : Mid-late 20s 

Size/shape : A-cup, size 8 about 165cm tall 

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese 

Services Provided : Massage, HJ 

Value for money/recommend? I had fun


So I hadn't heard from Sammy the witch for a while but did get a text invitation last satdy. The usual message ensued: "new girl. Good massage". Sammy seemed keener than usual for me to try. So I did. 

I rocked up Sunday morning and noticed nothing has changed at 287A. 

Sammy pushed me into a room and promptly mugged me for her fee. Then she again insisted this girl would be so good I'd be asking for 2hrs with her. Yeah right. 

Anyway Cici breezed in and got to work. 

Cici has long straight black hair worn in a pony tail. She's slim and friendly and even kind of cute.  Cici was happy to leave a lingering hand upon my naked self or impart the odd caress here or there. All good signs. 

Unfortunately Cici spoke little English so establishing rapport was futile. This is my usual MO. But it seems that Sammy had briefed her well because Cici wasted no time in brushing my balls. Soon the frequency and intensity of the TT grew as did my erection. Cici got herself close enough for me to run my hand up and down her legs. She did not flinch or lose concentration. Actually, Cici is a competent masseuse. 

Cici interpreted my instructions as well as I could have asked anyone I had only just met. I suppose Sammy knows me well enough but I suspect that Cici knows what she's there for. So if she's going to work for any extras she may as well try to enjoy some of it. Why the hell not?

Cici's stroke is long, deep and confident. She also uses the full palm of her hands so there's plenty of contact. She doesn't douse you in oil either and checks in with you by asking the odd "ok?", though not too often to be annoying.

Then came the flip and off came her tights. I hadn't even asked but Cici knew where we were going. I enjoyed that!

By this time I was rock hard and Cici did her best to end her stroke at my penis regardless of which part of my body was being massaged. I let her continue in silence and continued to steel caresses of her legs and bum. 

No sooner had Cici offered to bring me to a climax that she offered to do it nude. How could I say no? We settled on a pineapple. 

Then things got rather steamy and she got rather wet. Cici's face got close enough to my throbber for me to feel her warm breathing and even her lips. She also made sure I savoured her large soft nipples. 

I lasted as long as I could and exploded with an intensity unrivalled at Sammy's for a long time. Gladly paid my money and left exhausted but satisfied. 

Sammy was quick enough to seek my approval of her new charge and followed up with several texts.  

Cici only works Sundays and I hope to see her soon enough. 

Happy punting!

Name : May 

Establishment: Elegance Health and Beauty Saloon 

Address: 287a Liverpool Rd, Ashfield 

Date of Visit : 18/12/16

Hours of Business : Everyday (except Thursdays) 10:00am to 6:30pm 

Rates :$60/60 Minutes + $30 for HJ (what I offered, not what she asked)

Age : 25

Size/shape : slim, sexy body (only saw with clothes on)

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese Malaysian

Services Provided : Massage, HJ 

Value for money/recommend? Prepared to see her again


It is almost exactly a year since I have been to this place and Sammy greeted me with all the warmth of the Grim Reaper. After I had paid the money I was pleasantly surprised when a sexy young woman called May came in. I stripped and lay on the table. She asked me what kind of massage I wanted and I told her 'up to you'. She was a little perplexed but proceeded to give a mostly sensual and increasingly erotic massage. Lots of bum play which I love and some work on the undercarriage. I started rubbing her leg but wan't too pushy as this was our first encounter. On turn over she went straight into some nice play with little MB. Nothing rushed. Just a nice warm up which is missing with lots of younger MLs. I asked her about nude but said it was her period and didn't want to take off any clothes but was happy for me to play with her breasts under her top. She gave me a lovely slow and skilled HJ and I came with a massive shudder. She then massaged my head and legs for the remainder of the time. As I almost always get FS in the RnTs I go to, I often forget how good a skilled HJ can be. She assured me she will be happy to go naked next time. She displayed a delightful arse in her tight little shorts and had decent sized breasts. I will definitely be back to see her naked. 

Reluctant as I am to engage with Sammy again, I think this young lady has potential although I doubt it will progress much beyond a HJ. However, she does seem keen to have the $$$ and regular customers so you never know. All the previous MLs have left and I believe May is the only person working here except Sammy. She works every day. By the time I got home, I had a text message from Sammy asking if everything had ben OK. I assured her I was happy and would return. Obviously the business isn't going too well and she needs all the customers she can get. For those of you who know this shop, it might be time for a return visit.

Name : Sammy (Mamasan)

Establishment: Elegance Health and Beauty Saloon 

Address: 287a Liverpool Rd, Ashfield 

Date of Visit : 16/01/19

Hours of Business : Everyday (except Thursdays) 10:00am to 6:30pm 

Rates :$60 for waxing

Age : 40s

Size/shape : I'd give her one

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided : Wax & oil

Value for money/recommend? Yes

After another lacklustre massage from young Zen I asked her if she waxed. 

I do a bit of manscaping myself but the stubble is annoying and some punters on the forum have been talking waxing up, so I asked the question. 

Zen advised that she didn't know how to wax but that she would check with mamasan Sammy.  Zen dashed out and bounced back in to announce that Sammy would do the honours and that Zen would stay on to learn the art. I thought, why the hell not? I'm all oiled up, starkers, on my back and ready for action. 

Before I knew it, Sammy was in the room and both she and my young ML were rubbing all the excess oil from my flailing softie and my flattened out sac. I mean, it was so hot my nuts spread out like car mats. 

Soon after, Sammy was waxing me and showing young Zen the ropes.  Both pulled, tugged, prodded and waxed like I wasn't in the room. Kinda surreal. 

Now, this is the first time I've waxed but am a new convert. Sammy was generous with her touch and while it was all professional, there was enough ball tampering to put Warner to shame. Zen too got into the act and both MLs worked diligently on my undercarriage. 

After it was all done, Sammy applied oil all over my meat and 2 veg and it was all good fun even if she wore gloves and mask.  I'll make sure I return for seconds...in 4 weeks!

Happy punting!

I am pretty sure the answer to that is a big NO but I would happily be contradicted!

Sadly, no contradiction. She used to offer massages but only the therapeutic kind. I reckon she did stray for the odd bit of TT but maybe I'm flattering myself!

I did ask the ask the question one time if she would massage me but she declined as it was made clear sue does not provides massage services. However, she did offer me a wax but this time I declined. After reading TT's post, I have now the urge to ask the question...lol !

I have asked Sammy to massage me quite explicitly in the past and she has always refused. Only wanted her girls to do the massages. Has anyone been here recently?  Almost tempted to go back for old time’s sake. I have run into Sammy on the streets of Ashfield from time to time. She always asks me to some to the shop for a massage. She looks older and more matronly.

Last visited this joint back in January of this year. Had a average massage with a average R&T and an average looking ML.
And the 1 hour massage in increased to $70...do you believe that?
Has anyone else recently paid that amount at this God Forsaken craphole?

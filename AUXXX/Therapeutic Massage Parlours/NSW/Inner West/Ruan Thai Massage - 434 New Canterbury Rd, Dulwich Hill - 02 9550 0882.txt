Hi Gents, thought I'd give you all a "heads-up"... New Thai massage across the road and down 50m from the "True Thai massage" at Dulwich Hill opening (or actually should have opened last week...), the operators own 4 others seen in these pages around Sydney. Should be seeing some decent reviews soon.... Good Punting to all.

Hi All,

Went for a look last night, and this place has not yet opened. No other information on or around it so i could call and inquire. Windows still covered with newspaper, and "For Lease" sign still up. So i went across the road to True Thai.

Actually, great minds must think alike, as I too went yesterday, but the sign says "Leased by", not just For lease. I have it as a FACT100% reliable that it is what I say it is...

Wasn't doubting mate, just curious to see a new setup. 

Yep, you are correct, the sign did say that it was leased, as opposed to "for lease". 

Let us know when the gates are open

Must be close to opening now, window signage is up: "Ruan Thai Massage". And they've put in those adhesive signs that almost completely cover the windows so you can't see in, probably the second biggest giveaway that a place is dodgy after a sign that says "No sexual service".

According to the led sign in the window, they open for business on 27 oct, with opening special of $40/hr.

Still pricey compared to Bangkok

OK. MB had an hour or two to spare today and decided to take one for the team at this place. Initial impressions were very good. The place has been nicely decked out. Clean, new furniture and decorations. The spaces are partitioned so reasonable but not perfect privacy. I was met by a pretty young thing who told me later she was Nadia. At first she asked me to take off my clothes and then put on some oversized shorts. At this stage, I was ready to leave. I hate the shorts and any place that offers them has legit written all over it. I must have shown my displeasure because when she came back, she said I could take them off and I was massaged naked.

The massage itself was fantastic. This girl knows what she is doing. Absolutely no signs of any extras. Towards the very end of the massage, as she was massaging my arm, she said "Is everything OK?'. Given the size of my erection I thought this might be a sign and tried my luck. I moved her hand towards my penis. She was surprised and for a couple of minutes was kind of coy and pretended she didn't know what I wanted. However, she then went on to give me a very pleasant HJ and her technique certainly suggested she had done this before. She didn't ask for money then or later. I had to pull her aside before I left to give her a $20 tip.
At $60 for a great 1 hour massage plus HJ this was great value.

However she did indicate to me to be quiet in the room as if this was not condoned by the ladies at the front. This place looks legit and is run by a couple of old Thai ladies so I am not sure whether this will be standard service. Only time and a few more visits will confirm this. If I hadn't been a little forward I don't think she would have offered anything else. I guess all will be revealed but I hope this visit encourages others to experiment and report.

MB had a very bad experience at this place today. Signs were bad from the start. The ML was fat and ugly but as I was OK with a good legit massage I accepted that. On the front desk there is now a prominent sign saying 'No Hand Jobs' and "No B2B slides'. Inside the room she asked me to keep my undies on and I politely refused as I don't like oil on my undies. Any the massage was quite reasonable but not exceptional. When I came out she asked for $80. I said that the special is only $40. She said the special is for back only and I asked for aromatherapy. Now I have never had aromatherapy in my life. I pointed out that I had been there twice already and had exactly the same massage for $40. She basically called me a liar and even denied they were open last Thursday when I went there. I remained polite as she called her boss who also said I had to pay $80. I had given them $50 expecting change so I gave them that and left. I can't believe that would be so rude and pig headed to a customer when firstly they are new and when I am already a repeat customer. Anyway, I must have been lucky on my first visit. This place is definitely legit and there are much better places around. Avoid like the plague.

Becareful, this place hires ladyboys.

I visited this place about 4 week ago. I had a great massage (really can't remember what I paid but wasn't over the top). There were signs on the reception wall and desk that no Handjobs or Body slide were offered. I was instructed to strip to my undies. Like I said, the massage was great but given all the signs I didn't bother to ask for extras.

Now, across the road, at True Thai Massage however, is a different story altogether!

I'm trying to fathom how this place stays on business with the competition across the road offering the works. I don't think I've ever seen a punter coming or going from Ruan, and I drive past here a lot.

Hey guys anyone been to this new Thai massage shop. opposite the True Thai Massage shop at 467 New Canterbury Rd Dulwich Hill.
Better still can someone explain why they opened opposite the competition?

They appear to be flat out. They take bookings but some don't show and they are reluctant to allow someone to fill the no show slot.
WTF is going on in Dulwich Hill?
Will there be space for more shops is the leading question.

Any intel or reviews would be great.




Biggus.

BB, I suggest you search the forum and find the reports. Otherwise TOFTT and give us a full report and a business analysis of why to locate near the existing honey pot.

I tried to make a booking but they were booked out for two days. Goddammitt! Of course the thing is one does search the forums first before placing a post of this nature but as most in Sindney realise there are very few reports already in existence for new shops unless they are an established shop relocating. Hence the posting of this thread. Asking for assistance in eliminating the tasks of having to go and get another set of blue balls is just that. 

My Urologist said that he will have to put a drain in my nutsack if I continue buiding up stores of deoxygenated blood there. I sometimes feel faint upon passing by one of the dozens of New Thai massage shops. Hence i usually cross the street to avoid them. But in this case yeah you guessed it. 
Me no good it did! 

Anyway!


That is all.


Biggus.

Hey Biggus, this joint has been in operation for at least 18 months, well, that was the last and only time I paid this joint a visit. I noticed there was a sign on the receptionist desk stating ' No Sexual Service' or something similar. I paid $120 for a 90 Oil Massage. Was shown to one of the private rooms and a tall, cute late 20's Thai Girl that gave me a reasonable massage, I asked her the question but extras were a no go.  So, never been back since, when I'm in the area, I go straight to True Thai without hesitation.

Thanks Wachumba, It is funny I did a forum search and did not find the thread. I plugged in the name that comes up now in that thread. I notice however there is yet to be a review posted on the thread.
I am fairly sure that the search came up dud as the Forum was in software turmoil at the time of searching. It came up blank and i had done the manual search.
They do say they are under New category. I suspect they may have changed hands but i will look into it.

Meanwhile Mods could you combine this thread with the Ruan thread in Wachumbas Post thanks.

Thanks guys for the assistance. Much appreciated.


that is all.

Biggus.

 Tina - true Thai Massage, Dulwich Hill
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : tina

Establishment : true Thai Massage, Dulwich hill

Date of Visit : October 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 467 New Canterbury Road, Dulwich Hill; Phone number 02 8021 9052

Hours of Business : 10am - 9pm

Rates : $45 an hour + (I tipped $30)

Age : Early 20s?

Size/shape : petite, cute

Nationality or Ethnicity : thai

Services Provided : excellent massage + hand relief

Value for money/recommend? : yes

My experience/comments : this is not my fist visit to True Thai Massage. I return due to the quality massage provided plus the opportunity (not always offered) of something extra.
Tina is quite pretty, petite with a pretty smile and excellent massage skills. There is no option for the masseuse to be naked but for $45 plus Tip the value is outstanding.
Tina began with an excellent massage, on the turnover she massaged my legs under the towel and an offer was made for 'something extra' which I accepted. 
The only negative is the busy passing traffic and the noise from other massage clients as the cubicles are not floor to ceiling.
Excellent service from a nice girl, I will return.

Mods, I believe this review is in the wrong thread. Should be in 467. Could you move it.

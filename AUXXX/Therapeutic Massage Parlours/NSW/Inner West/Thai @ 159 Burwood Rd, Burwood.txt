I just noticed this place recently. Any of you local boys been there? I am keen to know if it is legit or if some extras are available.

MB, rest assured, from my (and only) experience here roughly 4 months ago, I had a totally legit session. I mean, I was asked to keep my underwear on which just ruined the moment. A Chinese Mamassan MILF runs the joint and has only Thai girls working as what she told me. Three private rooms I noticed, the room I was in was clean with a basin wash.
Pretty non-sexual massage it was and not really an over the top massage. The ML wasn't a stunner, but was pleasant and talkative, early thirties I'm guessing.

I know , bit of slack arse in not doing review, but really was trying to forget that over inflated experience in a quick way. Pity, was hoping this was to be a good new Thai Girls only Massage joint in Burwood that would offer extras, just wasn't the case for me. Who knows what might happen if you are a constant regular.

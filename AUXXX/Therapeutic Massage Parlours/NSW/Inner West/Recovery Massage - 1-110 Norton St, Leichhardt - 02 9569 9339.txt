I noticed this new shop opp the PALACE Theatre which has an openning special of $50 (parking is a problem, but they may have a spot for customers at the rear) I am not sure if they will be offering Happy Endings but being so close to the Council Chambers, I would doubt it, then again it's prime rental space on Norton so the rent would be a killer

There is lots of parking within 500 metres of this address. The Council car park in Marion Street has 2 hours free parking while the Norton Plaza has also 2 hours free parking. I could not find the Cracker add but googling 1/110 Norton St disclosed that is a 1 bedroom apartment, so it would have bathroom facilities.

Name of shop is Recovery Massage Leichhardt and there was an add for this place in Gumtree. Googling Recovery Massage Leichhardt strongly suggests that this is a legit place and not a jizz milking station.

Hi 

I visited last night, I had the best every proper massage, the girl who did the massage is the manager who does not normally massage she said was excellent and she says she trains the other girls.

She has posted ads on Gumtree and and cracker because she realises that punters want extra and she wants satisfied customers.

Now if i had pushed her she would have provided a HJ, but she clearly did not but made it very clear that her "younger girls" will provide extra. She said the place has three rooms with a rear entrance.

I said to her i didn't want her to do anything she did not want to do, she said IF she did HJ she would not take het top off, she said she is good at massage but  not other. 

I want to work on her to she if she is will willing and wants to go further so i did not push for HJ, i like her 

She  made it very clear that her "younger girls" will provide extra. She said the place has three rooms with a rear entrance.

She on the surface wants to provide an above the usual massage experience, and will leave it up to the girls if the do extra , but she i think wants them to do so discretely. 

I got a medibank private receipt so i can claim on my extras cover  

I am raving about the massage and she says she trains the other girls, I have booked for Friday so i will test the waters.

She is a very lovely person please treat her well.

I will update after Friday 

Cheers

110 Norton Street is owned by JESSIE who previously ran 120 Blaxland Street Top Ryde, who was forced to close as there was no DA to operate and word had got out they were doing more than massage, I visited this RnT yesterday and although Jessie is NOT going to do HJs, the younger ladies will, when I was there a women walked in for a massage which Jessie will do them and the others do the men. She has a openning special of $50 + $20, overall the shop is all very new and spotless.

HI

I have visited this establishment many times and the girls (Not Jessie) will do hand jobs, I have even had body slides front and back, touching, finger insertion and more.

very intimate. the thing is jessie ensures the ladies can massage as she caters for straight legit massage clients as well. She says she knows what men want and has girls to provide that.

Girls are rotated and so there are fresh experiences . All of this and health fund rebate as well.

The sad news is Jessie is selling, the new operator has a number of other massage shops.

When I know more I will advise.

Cheers

I haven't visited this place but I have had some news via a ML which suggests this place is going over to the dark side. It is being taken over by someone who has a shop at Top Ryde and I know that on Saturdays, the infamous Mimi from 252B will be working there. She is famous for her huge and beautiful breasts and her amazing body slides. Unfortunately she won't be known as MiMi there but by a Japanese name which I can't remember. If this place is more convenient than 252 B then give it a try. I assume the other MLs will offer similar services.

Person's Name : Kitty

Establishment : Recovery Massage 
Date of Visit : 28th March 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 1/110 Norton St, Leichhardt - 02 9569 9339


Hours of Business : 10 am to 9.30 pm

Rates : $35/30 $50/45 $60/60 +$20 HJ or +$40 Nude b2b and HJ

Age : 32 (or so she said) Maybe a little older

Size/shape : slim, great shape, A cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : massage, HJ, b2b

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : I thought I'd treat myself to a long weekend massage. As I was in the area and had read the above comments I thought I'd check it out and report back.
I walked in and was immediately ushered into a room. There a three rooms (3/4 walls) in the front of the shop. Looked clean. But There were tissues, not towels, on the face area of the massage table. I didn't get a choice of girl but I liked the shape of the one I had met and she was nice enough. Mid thirties, slim, not overly pretty, but nice enough. Her name was Kitty. English was OK. She said she had been in  Australia for a year. And she only works this shop on Tuesday and Thursday. 

Anyway, I asked for a 30 minute massage and would consider extending if I thought things were progressing well, if you know what I mean. She said a couple of times that half hour is too short and that 45 mins was better. Hmmm...I was trying to read between the lines. I wondered what "better" actually meant. The massage was actually OK, but it was more Chinese style.....you know, a lot of muscle kneading. And it felt rushed and not very erotic. I asked her to soften up a bit, but to no avail. She walked on my back, which was great. I noticed that they have those handle bars attached to the ceiling, so they must be serious about the massage aspect of the business, I guess.

So after about 15 minutes I decided to extend to 45 mins. That's when the fun started. Not sure if it was because of the extension to 45 minutes or whether it was just the time in her routine when she starts the tickle tackle. But it was good tickle tackle. I mean, really good. Lots of fondling and caressing. Eventually she leans over and asks if I want a HJ. Hell yes! $20 extra. So she flipped me and got to work. Shortly after I asked if she would remove her top. She said for another $20 she would nude up and bodyslide. How can I refuse an offer like that? She has a very tidy figure with really lovely pert A cup breasts. She let me feel and fondle all over. There wasn't that much b2b, mainly because I've got a lot of chest hair starting to grow back and it's spikey (my fault, don't really blame her for not wanting to get stubble rash). But what was lacking in b2b was made up in HJ action. She knows how to handle the tackle, that's for sure. She tried some flattery too...."oh you so strong" (meaning "I so hard!"). Well that was stating the bleeding obvious, but it was nice of her to notice 

Anyway, I blew my load. Got cleaned up (with wet ones) then flipped me back over onto my stomach to continue and finish the 45 minutes. 

There was another, slightly younger ML there. She was bigger (taller and just bigger). But Kitty pushed all the right buttons for me. A slower massage would have been that little bit better, but I didn't go for the massage.

Kitty: 7/10
Massage 6/10
Extras 8/10

Howdy All. So, since yesterday was Good Friday thinking a bunch of potential punters will have been observing this significance of this religious day, I 'm thinking, yeah, Friday night, not much doing, time to give this joint a try. 

Well, its started like this, yesterday afternoon I called in to make an appointment at 7:00pm, the girl that answered my call was kind of confused in what I was trying to achieve, to make a booking. I needed to repeat my request three times, and still I couldn't get my massage across. Her replies ..' massage' ..'booking'...'7:00 O'clock'...at the time her demeanor was something like, don't know what he is taking about, why is this guy ringing here for... I kept on asking the question, 'is 7:00pm ok? ' Then said sais 'yes' , I asked (twice actually), 'Do you need my name contact number'..  , she replied, 'yes..ok we do massage here'...then I said, 'I will see you tonight'..   From that point was this girls I'Q's lower than Julia Gillard, her understanding of the English language was poor, or she couldn't have given a FARK about her job and she didn't want to be there..  

Anyway, I got there actually 7:05pm, when I walked in, there was no one at reception,  there were a couple sitting down on the right waiting lounge. On the left waiting lounge, and, you wouldn't believe it, there was this fellow dressed in a female denim skirt, shoes, and a blonde wig !!  Yeah, great introduction to this joint, like, WTF ! That specimen was the last thing I wanted to see on this particular night, fark that !   Anyway, just digressing, then another punter just walked in and a ML came out of the massage area and directly asked the punter that came in after me if you would you like a massage and before he could have answered, I came back with.. 'Excuse me but I made a booking at 7:00pm..' she looks at me with amazement, she went to the front desk, looking down (I presume an appointment book or nothing at all..) I kept saying, ' I rang in the afternoon for a booking..nothing in book?' She was totally not understanding what was going on and didn't have the audacity to look at me when I was trying to communicate. So, I asked the question,' can I get a massage or are you busy', she told me I needed to wait 30minutes. I mentioned again to her that I rang earlier to make a booking but she was just lost on what I was trying to explain. From this point on, I was getting pissed off on the whole situation and said, 'I will come back another time' and walked out of there, will save my cash for another establishment for either Sunday or Monday. Bit of a disappointment  on the whole scenario, can anyone please confirm if they do accept appointments or is it who walks in will get first priority?

Funny post. I went on Thursday arvo (about 3.30 pm). I did ring earlier but got totally fed up with the confusion that a simple (attempted) booking created. I just turned up and was promptly shuffled into a massage room. The rest, you can read in the post above. No cross-dressing punters there either!!!

Hey all. I visited this place again last Thursday 4th April. I was greeted by a slightly older looking woman. I thought maybe she was the owner.

I was escorted into room and was asked how long. 45 minutes and because this girl looks like she may not be into the r 'n t I clarify that I want extras. She nods, asks me to get undressed. A minute or so later I hear the knock on the door and in she comes. BUT, she looks like another ml. She's got a different outfit on...a short dress. I'm not disappointed. I ask her name but for the life of me I can't remember her name and I asked twice...I think it was Mandy. If not Mandy, then it started with an M. The reason I can't remember I'll get to later.  As I find out a little later she says she is only in on Monday's and Thursday's. The rest of the time she is at "her" shop at top ryde. She is the boss lady it seems.

And you know what? She had that air of boss lady to her. Just the way she did things I guess. Anyway, she starts off with a soft massage which pretty quickly turns into a lot of caressing. She works her magic around by crack and sack, which I love and tell her so. She uses a tissue to lightly feather my back and bum. Mmmmm, great feeling there. Eventually she asks  what I want (as in extra). I say nude b2b and hj. $50 extra for this service. 

On flip she strips and reveals a pretty tidy body. B cups and slimming. She is pretty and I,like her personality. Very friendly, speaks good enough English. At that point she asks if I want a second girl. I'm short on cash and decline. No problems, she says. Not pushy at all.

So she starts the front tease, b2b which I'm enjoying and starts caressing me around my butt hole. Now, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea but I love the feeling there. Theres a million nerve endings just waiting to be turned on. She sees that I'm enjoying this and asks if I want some finger insertion. I've had one other ml do that before and I loved it. So yes I say. 

She says she needs to go glove up and slips out of the room for a moment. Comes back, oils ups and very gently slips a finger in  tentatively. I'm just going wild now. She asks if I want it deeper and slips it in a little further, not too far and starts to pump my prostate. I'm rock hard by now and she quickens her pace and I explode really strongly. Wow! She slips her finger out, takes the glove off cleans me up quickly and excuses herself to go wash up. I like her attention to hygiene. 

She comes back in and cleans me up with hot towels and finishes off the session with a head massage. I loved her demeanour. Very professional.  On the way out she introduces me to another girl. Young, slim and gorgeous. I think she introducedmher as Sumi, but I'm not sure. The whole ass play experience really messed my short term memory!!
She suggests i shouldntry this girl next time I come in. I got the hint that she is new to the game. But she was very seductive looking.

Anyway, for those who are in the inner west, this place is well run, clean and the boss lady is a great girl too!

Cost: $50/45 min plus $50 nude body slide, prostate massage and hj.
VFM? Hell yes!!

 New place in leichhardt
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Coco

Establishment : Recovery Massage

Date of Visit : April 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop B 110 Norton St Leichhardt  - (no website!)

Hours of Business : 10am till 7pm

Rates : $60 an hour

Age : about 25

Size/shape : D cup, generally slim but with a little tummy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : HJ, Body to body

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :
Noticed this place had opened a couple of weeks ago so thought I'd give it a shot. No advertising or indication of anything but massage but I like not knowing what I'm going to get to be honest! Went in on a Sunday afternoon, greeted by mamasan, she's wearing a fairly see through dress so I'm starting to think it might be more than just massage! She shows me to a room - it's a small shop, just three rooms.
Girl comes in and introduces herself as Coco. She's Chinese, huge rack and a bit of a tummy and I guess rightly ( I found out later) that she's had a baby recently. Still she's very cute - big eyes, pretty smile and did I mention the huge tits?!
Anyway starts of all massage. I'd say she was pretty good and I'm pretty demanding. Then she starts to massage the upper thighs to see if I'm into it which she figures I am. Offers HJ ($20)or body to body ($50). As much as I wanted to see those titties I was a bit freaked by the baby belly so went with the HJ. She was a little disappointed (yes, I'm aware that it was the money!) but got into in nonetheless. Was happy to let me have a good feel and gave me the sexy eyes to get me over the line.
The place itself was pretty ordinary but the service was great. Will probably go back...

Quick Review:

Thursday 11th April
ML: Kerrie  (or was it Kelly??) Tall, slim, attractive, poor English.
Cost ($50 + $50 for nude and HJ)
My third visit to this shop but first time with Kerrie.
Good massage. On flipside she's competent. Lovely figure. She jumps on the table and starts grinding her pussy on my cock. No penetration. She shaved her  pussy lips (left a tuft of hair) but the stubble had started to grow back. So the awesome pussy sliding was was counteracted by the stubble brushing up along the shaft of my cock! I still enjoyed it, to some extent though. And eventually I got over the line.  Does that qualify as TOFFT?? 

Would I see her again? Probably not

Person's Name : Sophie

Establishment : Recovery Massage

Date of Visit : 20th June 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop B 110 Norton St Leichhardt 

Hours of Business : 10 to 8

Rates : $35/ half hour plus $50 nude b2b and hj

Age : 24

Size/shape : Slim, great body A cups, natural (god I wish they shaved!)

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese (been here 2 months)

Services Provided : massage, b2b and hj (no BJ when asked)

Value for money/recommend? : Yep

My experience/comments : I popped in her last week at the same time (about 4 pm) but was busy and was asked to wait 45 min. I couldn't wait and ended up at the new RnT shop[ on Parramatta Rd, Petersham (which I've reviewed a couple of times.

Anyway, I popped in today at the same time (bout 4 pm) and found Sophie seemingly asleep on one of the massage beds.I guess they're not as busy as last week. Sophie ushered me into a room.I went for the half hour option, paid and stripped. She pretty much asked me straight away if I wanted a second girl. Not this time, I say.

Her English is non existant. I try to make small talk, pretty much failed due to the conversation being lost in translation. The massage was typical chinese style, which I'm not a fan of. It seemed rushed and random. I did get some nice TT close to turnover time.

At turnover time I was offered a b2b (I couldn't understand what she was saying and had to ask a few times).Eventually I agree. What I didn't like was the price haggling. I paid with a $100 bill and left the change from !$35 on the table. While we're haggling, she's eyeing the cash. ANyway, we agree on $50. She strips off to revela an awesome, lithe figure with beautiful small breasts and nice brown nipples. She's not shaved (damn!). But all that pales into insignificance when she starts massaging and teasing my cock. In contrast to my last three punts (at Narre Relaxing Massage, Parramatta Rd, Petersham) this girl really knows how to get a man excited. While her massage was hurried her handjob was soft, slow and ever so hot. Her legs remain firmly closed, so theres not playing with her pussy. Eventually, I blew a load allover her tiny tits. Mmmmmmmm. I'd say one of the best HJs I've had.

The down side, however, was that she yawned a bit throughout the session. Not surprising given I found her sleeping on the table when I walked in. While It was a bit off putting I did find it funny as well. That's punting for you! You never know who or what you'll get!

Summary:
Massage:  5 or 6/10
HJ: 10/10
Overall: 9/10 (if only they offered CBJ)

Would I see her again? Yes! she's one of the sexiest, if not least articulate, girls I've seen.

She's pretty,in an odd sort of way. But her body is gorgeous. She's very fuckable.

Person's Name : CC (Yep, that's how she reckons she spells it)

Establishment : Recovery Massage

Date of Visit : 7th August 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop B 110 Norton St Leichhardt 

Hours of Business : 10 to 8

Rates : $35/ half hour plus $50 nude b2b and hj

Age: 24

Size/shape : Slinky gorgeous body, A cups, awesome nips

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage, nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yep!

My experience/comments : So, it's been a few weeks since I visited this place. I had an appointment in the area so thought I'd treat myself to a second punt this week.
CC greeted me and ushered me in to the room. I don't think mamasan was anywhere to be seen. There was some lurker in the back room, cigarette smoke wafting through the place and the TV on loud. The last few times I've been there the scene was calm, with gentle music playing in the background. This time I had to ask CC to turn the sound down as it was not very conducive to a relaxing massage. As they say, when the cat's away the mice will play.

ANyway, I asked for a half hour, paid and got myself ready. CC has an great lithe figure. She's pretty and probably the nicest ML I've ever chatted to. Her massage was OK, not bad, and since I asked for a soft massage as my lower back was out of whack she did a splendid job.

On flip she asked straight up if I wanted a handy. Of course! That's why I'm here! Standard $50 for nude and HJ at this place. She has an awesome figure. Hairy, sadly. So while she's stroking me I strike up a conversation about how Asian chicks generally do not shave. It's funny, now that I think about it that we're having the convo about hairy v's shaved pussies, and what we prefer while she's gently tugging me. I must say she has a pretty good command of English and a great sense of humour. One of the best MLs I've come across. So I eventually come, she cleans me up while I'm marvelling her great bod! 

Now, a thing about this massage joint is the way that the MLs compliment you EVERY time. It must be a mamsan rule or something, I don't mind really. It's a good  marketing ploy for your business and keeping the customers happy. This time CC asks if I work out because I have a good body (yeah, right....I do a bit and stay active, but struggling at my age).  But I accept the compliment graciously and with a grain of salt. 

So fellow punters, I'm happy to report a successful punt. (Read my report from yesterday about Serenity massage and you'll see why I'm so please today)

Summary:

Massage 6/10
HJ 8.5/10 (this girl has some skill)
Overall service by CC 10/10

Would I see her again? Without a doubt!

There was another ML her who popped her head out when I got there. Hadn't seen her before. Good looking, deepish voice, nice body.

This was my 2nd time with Sophie. Read my review above. She hasn't changed much from the last review. Her massage was typical chinese kneading. But her HJ and body slide were great. She strips and reveals a hairy snatch (damn!). She keeps her legs closed and is very careful to avoid most of my roaming hands.

All in all a good punt. I love her sexy body and great nipples.

 But her HJ and body slide were great. She strips and reveals a hairy snatch (damn!). She keeps her legs closed and is very careful to avoid most of my roaming hands.

All in all a good punt. I love her sexy body and great nipples

Nice review Oztone. 

Sounds like good VFM to me.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 1, 110 Norton St Leichhardt, 9569 9339

Hours of Business : 10-7 (as advertised on their front window, but I got there at 7 so dependes on the day I guess)

Value for money/recommend? : No (but I have been here before and had an excellent experience too)

My experience/comments : 

Went here on a Friday hoping for a great massage to end the week. Was greeted by a ML with big tits in her 40's who led me to a room then said she would get the masseusse. So I disappointingly got Sally in her 50's, not attractive but I thought that with her experience it could be even better.
Requested 30mins and stripped off in front of her before lying down. Asked for a hard massage and it started off really well. Then it just became a bit mechanical, (rub shoulder 5 times, move to other shoulder, to back 7 times, then maybe the other side). I could then tell she was probably right handed in the way she massaged which was strong on one side and soft on the other... and with the sides she was massaging me it meant that she worked my left side damn hard and the right missed out.
On the flip got offered the HJ for $20 and she lifted her top for $30 in total. Her tits were alright, nice nipples but for her age the were good B-cups. Had a good feel of them and although she was initially hesitant she began to open up to the fondling more which certainly helped me. 

It's hard to say I won't return but this experience did turn me off, but considering I have had a good massage there before which I got B2B, naked HJ, and COB I may return sometime in the future.

Person's Name : Maya

Establishment : Recovery Remedial Massage

Date of Visit : Friday

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 1, 110 Norton St Leichhardt, 9569 9339

Hours of Business : 10-7 (as advertised on their front window, but I got there at 7 so dependes on the day I guess)

Rates : 30/$35 45/$55 60/$65

Age : 20's

Size/shape : 8 cute as a button with natural c cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : MLC

Services Provided : semi-nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : OK

My experience/comments : 

Was in  the area and thought i would give this place a go. I was actually heading to the Thai joint next to this place but on walking past it had all the signs of a RT joint so i thought why not.

Inside its standard Chinese RT place cheaply put together. Ushered into the room by a 40+ MILF who was not really my cup of tea and asked to undress. To my surprise and delight Maya walked in to start the massage. Cute 20 something chines girl with excellent english and the cutest but i have seen in ages.

massage was OK with plenty of pushing of groin into my arms and rubbing boobs on back when she can. This went on for a while and then before flip she asked if i wanted extras. $50 nude was negotiated but she left on panties which i was a bit annoid about. 

anyway some great tugging from behind while playing with my ass and then asked me to flip where she rubbed her boobs up and down me and finished me off in a cow girl simulated sex position.

Was a great end to the massage.

She said she had only been in the country 4 months and that it was her second day working. This i highly doubt due to her great english and competency of the massage part 2 but if that's what punters want to here good on her for playing along.

Also on the flip i noticed bars on the roof for a walking massage although this was not offered in this session.

I wouldn't o out of my way for this but if your in the area drop by for sure.

Visited this place randomly. Weird experience. It was a very warm day, yet she 'massaged' me through a towel - so hot.
But that massage was merely pushing and pressing, nothing really massagey about it. I did touch her legs, and moaned a bit to see whether she would get the hint.
She brought her legs together after a while.
No tackle tickle at all.

But, then on turnover, she negotiated all the naughties, and gave a not-too-bad HJ. She asked me to squeeze her A-cups.

And then it was over...

Says she works here Fridays and Sundays.

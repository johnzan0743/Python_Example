My experience/comments :

Decent fit-out, Jenny claimed it is 6 months old, which seems about right from my knowledge of the area.

She was friendly enough. Seemed like the only one in the shop. Good English but a bit too chatty for my liking.

Watch out for the pricing here.  Their ad on BP has low rates, but they are much higher in the shop, and also with a "premium" option for $5-10 more. I asked what it was and she said "It's better massage!".  So what, the regular $40/hh is a crap massage but the $45 is great?  No marketing geniuses here...

Massage was good, though.  She is tiny but strong and reasonably trained. Not quite as good as proper remedial shop, but would be quite a bargain for $30hh or $50h.

Part 2 was not great. She offered b2b but is a bit old for my taste in that, so I opted for the $20 HJ, which included her letting me feel her cute bum through her jeans.  Here is where her chattiness got really distracting, especially when she recommended that next time I should include a waxing.  Yeah, nice way to turn me on, Jenny. Tell me I'm too hairy, that's hot!  Fortunately I could still get over the line, but as I got close to finishing she clamped down like a fucking vice grip...it was seriously the hardest that anything has ever gripped my cock and I nearly cried out in pain. Had to convince her to ease off so I could cum, but she seemed to think she knew best and kept the pressure at uncomfortable levels.

So yeah, if you want a decent massage for negotiable prices and don't mind your cock possibly getting torn off by a cute Milf with a petite body and big tits, this is a good bet.  I'll stick to the Thai places down the road though!

FYI, there is a sign on the door that the shop is closed due to the owners being on holiday, with no reopening date noted.

My experience/comments :

You'd think I'd have learned my lesson, but when I saw an ad that this premises seemed to be open again, I thought I'd take a punt.

Bit of confusion, as their ad says they have a back door, but it is completely unmarked and attached to the main building carpark. She tried to encourage me to come round front, which I resisted (the point of the back door is so that I wouldn't have to stand on Parra road waiting, right?) and eventually understood why when she collected me and led me up and down stairs eventually into the shop.

I was pretty sure it was the same Jenny from my last review, confirmed when she mentioned waxing during the T/T. Sigh. This time though, she droned on about using some 'machine' next time if I booked a longer session. Supposedly some kind of massage machine, but you couldn't pay me enough to let her go at me with something plugged into the wall when her tiny hands are already able to crush a palm tree trunk to dust.  

Again, ok place for a decent massage with a simple HE from an attractive but overly chatty milf, but I won't be fooled again...

I stopped in a couple of times and the girls were 40+ so I walked.  Has that improved in the last few weeks?

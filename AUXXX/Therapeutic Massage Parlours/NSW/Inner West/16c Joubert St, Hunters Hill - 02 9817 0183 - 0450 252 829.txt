Post Content: 
This Chinese RnT at 16c Joubert St Hunters Hill # 98170183 # 0450252829 has been opened for some time and it did have a Thread openned, it was staffed by Mature Asians charging the usual $55 p/h plus Hand Job and some do the extra HJ & Clothes off for an extra $50, the Joeys Boys now have a good choice with the other RnT at 3/3 Ryde Road ( http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f63/3-...t=Hunters+Hill )

Their advert in the Massage Section of the local rag is





			
				REMEDIAL relax massage. free parking. Next door to the Real Estate office
			
		

In this week's "Northern District Times" there is a new advert in "Adult Services" section,





			
				AT Hunters Hill best Massage. New Open. 7 Days. # 0469783794
			
		

and me thinking there must be a 3rd RnT opening was informed 16c Joubert St Hunters Hill has new owners with new younger Asian Girls / Ladies still at $55 p/h

went in and was expecting Lilly to be there... got told by Susan she is on holidays... came across as a bit of a lie with the hesitation but anyway she said she would do me a good massage instead...

well it was an average massage... she felt like she knew how to massage but just wasnt in to it... slight TT and flipped over... she got me over the line but I had to help her with how to stroke my dick.. she just didnt seem that interested and it was a huge let down from the previous week...

I will hopefully see Lilly again next week... she drained me good and proper

My experience/comments : went to this place on two consecutive mondays...

last week I saw LILLY... gave a great massage for 30 minutes... only a back massage but was really good and knew her stuff then she gave me and awesome prelude to what was a tug that could only be described as cock worship... she absolutely worked my dick perfectly and looked me in the eye like she wanted me to blow a huge load for her.. really one of those special punts where youre glad you went...she licked my nipple and really made me feel like she was enjoying my cock in her hands... two hands slowly up and down my shaft with lots of oil... great time indeed... would love to know where else she worked but the walls dont go up to the cieling so only know she works there mondays which leads me into this mondays punt..

I can understand why you posted two reviews together (same business, only a week apart) but I have split your
joint review of Lucy and Susan into two reviews so that you get the credit for posting a second review, and the
forum members get to read about Lucy without the distraction of Susan.

Good reviews.

Well Susan has gone on holidays to China for a month or two and left the lovely Tina (very attractive Japanese MILF) there to run the show every day. 

My tip is to skip the pretty young things (although ones like the lovely Lucy on Saturdays are hard to ignore).

Enjoy.

My experience/comments:

I saw Kim for a great 30min massage this week. Started off a little slow with Part 1 about average. Part 2 made up for the slow start with Kim getting her kit off to reveal a perky set of B cups with long nipples. Managed to play for a while downstairs before she oiled up my rod and went to town with an enthusiastic HJ. After 10 mins I couldn't wait any longer and asked her to climb on top so I could rub against her (now very wet) slit while I came. Great finish and will be going back for sure!

Bensmith85, where did you see Kim's advertising ? she doesn't come up on Cracker, Backpage or Locanto, is she working from a private apartment or is she in Massage shop at 13 Joubert Street

My thinking is that it could also potentially be from a local newspaper ad, but hopefully Ben will be able to provide the way of how he found Kim, because that's a pretty decent find.

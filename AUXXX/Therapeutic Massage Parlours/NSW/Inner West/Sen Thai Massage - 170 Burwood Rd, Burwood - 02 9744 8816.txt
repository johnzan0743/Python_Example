My experience/comments: You are placed in a room and given pants to wear. I always ask for hard massage here and I get what I expect, find a similar treatment everytime - back, legs, feet and arms are all given massage. But have sometimes received short head and neck massage too (which is exceptional). Complimentary glass of water or cup of hot tea afterwards.

Thanks for the review/report. Great to know where there is a good legit place when the ironing out of kinks is required. As I recall this place is written up within one of the daily print media travel advisory as being equivalent to actually being in Thailand.

I have been here a couple of times too. No sign of any extras being provided, but they do a good massage in relieving tense muscles.

Establishment : Sen Thai Massage - 170 Burwood Road, Burwood 

 Date of Visit: Friday 4 July 2013

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink: Sydney Thai Massage - The Best Massage from Thailand right here in Burwood and Bondi

 Hours of Business: 10am-10pm

 Rates: 45/hr weekdays, 49/hr weekends but this is for Thai massage; oil massage around $20/hr more expensive than this; health fund rebate available

Name:  Alice

 Age: 22.

 Size/shape: Young presumably Thai girl very small but cute

 Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai.

 Services Provided: oil massage for $69/hr 

 Value for money/recommend?: Yes.

 My experience/comments: Nice ambience, extremely relaxing, restful, relative gentle so not so much into the 'sports' type massage. Alice works here all day Friday Saturday Sunday and either here or at Bondi on the other days after 4pm.  Alice was incredibly attentive and gentle - I could have stayed all day.  I might go for 1.5 hours next time.  The health fund rebate takes the edge of the price.   I don't have other experience with other Thai shops to make a good comparison, but as mentioned above I do plan to book with Alice again for 1.5 hours.

My massage was oil with underwear on; the other review above refers to 'shorts' for the traditional thai massage (non oil)

Had a wonderful remedial massage with Alice today. Definitely had no back stiffness after Alice's massage. Alice not a great conversationalist, think not too brilliant English. My number 1 here is Paula, the boss. Alas she on holidays, in Thailand. Massage done wearing my underpants. No hanky panky here, totally legit, health fund rebates makes for less taxing on finances. Definitely revisit when in need of fixing massage.

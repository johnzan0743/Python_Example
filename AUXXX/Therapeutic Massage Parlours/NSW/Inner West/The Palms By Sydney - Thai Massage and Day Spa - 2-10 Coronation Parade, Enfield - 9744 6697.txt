[COLOR=#333333]Other comments: We've all done it, driven past a massage joint and thought..hmmm...then search it up on this forum.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]I couldn't find anything on this place, so decided to hit it up today. After my last tragic venture to True Thai, I thought hopefully this would be better. I call up and ask how much is a massage, they said $60 for Thai, and $85 for oil...I thought well...$25 extra for oil..hopefully includes Hj.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]WRONG!. I book, I go in and have to pay upfront...then they sit you down on a sofa chair and wash your feet etc...smells legit, looks legit, I already paid..oh well....at least this massage better be good.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]Into the massage room, I'm ordered to leave my underwear on. I lie down and my therapist covers me in two towels..fuck..legit massage. Oh well. No hint of TT, no hint of anything another guy walks into the shop and asks for massage then asks 'you do special massage ?' they said no and closed the door on him. Smart man I should have done the same.

Overall massage is OK, but too pricey. So if anyone was wondering about the Thai massage place opposite Dan Murphy's and near the Golf Clearance shop..then yeh it's 100% legit from my experience. at $85 a massage I won't be trying my luck here again.

Thanks for taking one for the team mrlova, I drive past there quite regularly when heading to the Burwood ML's and was tempted.

I think the OP may have got the wrong address for this shop. My friend Mia ex 368 Pennant Hills Road recently took over this shop - unfortunately it has continued its current tradition and will be LEGIT THAI MASSAGE ONLY !! But a really good one according to my friend but it will have to wait until I have time to check it out myself. Driving all way to Strathfield for a legit Thai massage is not a huge incentive though.

MODs, can you please update the title as follows;

The Palms By Sydney - Thai Massage and Day Spa

Address: 2/10 Coronation Parade, Enfield NSW 2136

Phone: (02) 9744 6697

Hours: Open today · 10am9pm


Many thanks

I think Mia might have had some Council issues over at 368! And according to her, she getting older now and really doesn't want to work in RnT any more, so decided to go legit and happy to earn less money but legit and safe !

While I certainly will miss her personally but totally understood and respect her decisions .

Cheers

Wait until she realises that the doorbell doesnt ring to often at a legit shop  compared to what she is used to.

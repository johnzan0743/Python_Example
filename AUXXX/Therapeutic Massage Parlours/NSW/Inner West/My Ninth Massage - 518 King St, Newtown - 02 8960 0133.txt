 My Ninth Massage - 518 King St, Newtown - 02 8960 0133

Name: Yaya
Location: my ninth massage
Time: 5 PM, fifth of January 2013
Cost: 35/30, +15 tip


Because these guys advertise here, I assumed that there will be something dodgy (in a nice way) about the place. When I arrived, strangely enough there were three ladies sitting down behind the counter. Looked interesting.


However, everything else from the decor to the dress of the girls screamed legit. In fact, after I had chosen my massage and been led to the room, the decor really did impress me. The room I had was, I think, the first one on the left, which had a little lightwell/atrium right next to it. The fit out is professional, with good-quality fittings and some greenery in the room. The massage table/bed had those neatly folded towels on it. There were really only three indicators that perhaps something more might be on offer:
1: the price-$35 is cheap for a 30m Thai massage
2: mirror in front of the head end of the table
3: advertising on Auxxxreviews 


Anyway, this time nothing dodgy happened. I made no approach, and it all seemed so professional that I was too embarrassed to ask. Yaya has been in the country for two months, learning English. Now, what can I say about the massage? It was a highly professional Thai massage. She knew all the moves, this is as good as it gets in Bangkok (except for price). There's nothing more I can say. It was a professional massage and you can tell that she has been well trained. 

I have no idea how to broach the subject of extras. Anyone else tried??

DrBob, you are a silver member yet you "have no idea how to broach the subject of extras"?  Pull the other one.  Mate, you must have been off your game big time.  Pehaps a little too much Christmas cheer over the holiday period has blurred your vision.  A simple "do you do extras?" normally elicits the response required in these situations.  Another episode like this and I'll be on the phone to my legals seeking an injunction from silver status

This place was always a rnt one of those $110 b2b Thai places a change name but an Aus xxx affiliate will get you at least a massage and pull one would imagine. I can't see a legit massage joint being an affiliate here

 May at My Ninth Massage
				
Post Content: 
Back here again, and still too gutless to negotiate - the vibe just feel too professional. But I got there anyway:
Name: May
Date: 9 February, 2013 around 2:30pm
works: Fri, Sat, Sun
age: mid-20s I think
figure: OK, clothed so that's the best I can say
English: good
services: HJ
cost: 50/60 + 50

OK, didn't feel right to negotiate anything upfront. Nonetheless, May started with her professional massage. This was very good. Now, what I like about Thai is that you don't get the obvious Chinese tackle-tickle. Instead, you get pressure in sport in your upper legs, buttocks and near the groin with any toughing of the tackle itself. This is much more of a turn on, and I responded. Was turned on, started moaning and raised my bum a little in response (had to give the Little Doctor some room to grow). As she saw me respond, she focused on that area more. Mind you, this was about 30 mins in, after I had gotten my comprehensive focus on the legs, which I asked for after quite a tiring week.

On turnover, May notice that the mast had raised and, after some time on the lower legs, go her hand and thumbs in that nook between the tackle and the legs. Very stimulating. After a while, she asked if I wanted a HJ. Note to self: do not negotiate when aroused:- I immediately agreed to $50/HJ. Ouch.

Having said that, her working of the tackle was very effective. Touching the stomach and upper thighs (and the perineum) is just as important as touching the Little (now Big) Doctor.

What can I say?  My potential was manifest (mainly on my stomach, cleverly directed by May). She cleaned my, gave me a hot towel and then - to fill the remainder of the time - gave me a head massage.

She has been working here for 2 months, has been in Aus for 4 (studying). She recommended that I ask for an oil massage next time. I tend to have some issues with right leg flexibility, and so she thought that an oil massage would be more relaxing for me.

Would I return? yes.

this place is a bit all over the shop. booked to see May (ladyboy) and she had to get the other girl to do the first 15mins as another customer came in at the same time and asked only for May. even though i had a booking, this other customer got priority and i was to hear why.

while 'Ja' why was massaging me, i hear very loud, over the top grunting and moaning. if i was conservative i would had walked out instantly thinking this place was a brothel. but i'm a perv, so i laid still amused. In a nut shell, May serviced this guy for a 15min quickie. then she came back and gave me a non-sensual oil massage.

Clearly this place offers extras, but you must ask. I didn't because the massage was not putting me in the mood.

Date: Friday arvo. 11 October
Name: May
Cost: $45 - half hour; deep tissue

I'll have to admit I had more knots than last week's fleet put together when I dropped by this place. I needed a real massage, with the hope of some relief in the form of pleasure and (less) pain. I asked about their half hour massage, and the receptionist, who I assumed was May  young, slim, gentle face  showed me their menu of massages and talked me up to a deep tissue oil massage, which was a little more expensive. She showed me to a room and asked me to take off my shirt (only). I should mention, it felt like I was the only person there. 

I was expecting oil for an Oil Massage, but got dencorub/tiger balm instead. What followed was half an hour of torturous elbows and kneading knots that wouldn't budge. My legs were curling in pain! I moaned, groaned and ground my teeth down. Once she asked if I was ok. 'You're killing me' I said. She laughed, said 'Too many knots' and went on with the torture. She went to my head briefly, I turned over very briefly, made me sit up and massaged around the neck briefly. Then it was 'That's All'. I asked why she didn't go any lower than my shoulder blades  after all the back is inter-related and goes down to the waist - and she told me I wanted her to concentrate on the neck and shoulders. I didn't recall saying 'To the exclusion of all other body parts,'... so out I walked, feeling a little better, a bit miffed, stinking of dencorub and still carrying a load. 

Seems like this place has wrestled with the remedial vs erotic massage and gone back to the former... but I could be wrong, as I did walk in wanting my neck fixed. But it was very quiet. What I doubt is whether I will be going back, unless my creaks and the smell disappear by tomorrow.

I've been here a dozen or so times over the last few months and this forum aside I've never had any indications of it been anything other than a strictly remedial shop.

With the exception of one visit I've always visited on a Sunday and I have always had Honey as the masseuse.
Very happy with her firm massage, which is the reason I go back to this shop.
If I want other services I now just go to one of the other places.

Size/shape: slim 5"8-ish

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai

Services Provided: Oil massage HJ

Value for money/recommend?: yep! 

My experience/comments: 

I hadn't visited this place for close to a year, firstly i'm not in the area often, but also my last visit was very disappointing. So why go back? Well, i was in the area and as i drove past there was a spot out front and I was in great need of a legit massage. I walked in was greeted by May and i said i wanted a 45min oil massage. She/he led me into a room, asked if I had been there before  to which i said yes. "Take off your clothes i come back" She/he said. 

As soon as the massage started I had no regrets, May is very good with a combination of strong and relaxing hands applied. She did my legs and got much closer to my groin then last time. I asked to go further and she then asked "You want extra? $30" I tried to get her down to $20 she never wavered. "I am very good" she then said. And, sure enough she was fk'n amazing. Huge amount of ball massage while i laid face down before the turn over.

definitely worth the $30. I was very impressed at her HJ skills. Also, she is not shy of sliding her finger in your ass. NOT AT ALL!

On the way out i met Yumi  i think her name was. she is cute. Wanna try her next...

I thought I'd give this place a go, as my lower back was sore. At the counter was May and a younger girl. They had four different massages with four different times.  I went for the hour-long Thai massage.

I was given the Thai baggy pants, so I realised this would be chaste. Damn. It was different in that May put a towel on me, warmed me up and then started walking on my back. I'd never had one of these before. Interesting feeling for a foot fetish fan, although the towel took something away. (I also realise any tackle-tickle would be out of the question).

She did the whole of my body on her feet, used her hands now and again. I moaned, groaned and felt I was put through a printing press. She finished sitting behind me, massaging shoulders while stretching me. Then it was 'Thank you. Finished' and she was out of the room before I could say 'Thanks. Do you... ' 

It was a thorough massage, but I left with a new pain in a shoulder blade that stayed for days, so I can't say it was the best massage I've had. And I doubt it will ever be my ninth.

Always ask for the oil massage in Thai places if you want a HJ. For the record, May gives a great HJ and not shy in sliding a finger up da ass either.

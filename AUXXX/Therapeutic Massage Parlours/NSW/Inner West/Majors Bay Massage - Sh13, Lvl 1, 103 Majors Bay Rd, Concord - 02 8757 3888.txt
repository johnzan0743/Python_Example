My experience/comments : Found this place when I was looking for another joint in the same complex which, as I now know, has closed. It is located in a business complex which resembles a block of units, beige bricks, at the northern end of the Majors Bay Rd shopping strip (next to the bottle shop). As you are looking at the complex it is on the 1st floor to your left. Lifts are located centre back of the building.

Entered and was greeted by Jenny, who has just bought this place from the previous owners. Jenny also owns the RNT at Castle Hill ( http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f75/di...9-0399-a-4195/ ). She was the only one working when I was there, but she mentioned she will 2 girls working there each day going forward.

There are 3 cubicles: they all back on to a common wall with the next unit, have office style partitions on each side which go to the roof, and a curtain for the door. Each rooom is your typical RNT set-up. The massage tables, however, are the professional type, not the DIY wooden frame with piss-weak padding. Very clean, with disposable sheets covering the table and tissues covering the head-rest.

Went with the 30 min option to test this place out. Offered soft/medium/hard - went with the medium option. Beware: The medium verges on hard! But the quality of massage was above average for a RNT joint. Followed a typical routine of back, arms, shoulders, neck, and then legs. Minimal but sufficient oil was applied. Just a couple of slight tackle brushes along the way. Once the back half was done the light massage followed, clearly indicating there was something else on offer. Asked to turn-over, and then offered a HJ for another $20, which was accepted. HJ was very good, good ball massage included, and was over the line in reasonable time. Light touching was allowed through her clothes.

WIR? Perhaps, maybe to see what the other ladies are like, or if I need a good quality massage frrom Jenny.

Cheers,

BAB

Establishment: Major's Bay Massage

Person's Name : Mina

Contact Details:  13 Lvl 1. 103 Major's Bay Road

Hrs:  10am - 7pm

Visit date: Dec 2011
Rates:  $35/30 min  $60/60min

Age:  35 +

Nationality:  Chinese

Services:   Massage + HJ + nude

Value For Money:   Just about.

Experience:   Was  in the vicinity and previously had used the massage shop that used to be on the ground floor here.  As far as i could see you have to use the lift to get to level one as the door to the stairs appears to be locked, although you can come down using the stairs.  Lift is at rear centre of the block.

Turn right out of lift and walked around to the shop, which seemed empty, but  a Chines MILF promptly came out of a small kitchen type area at the right rear.  She led me to a cubicle near the rear which had a door, as had the other cubicle(s) so these may have been installed since BAB was there.  I took the 30min option which was $35.00 and opted for a medium massage.  ML began the massage and said her name was Mina and came froma town not far from Shanghai.   Massage was unexceptional, but a lot of attention was paid to lower back, bum and upper legs, with a fair amount of brushing the sac, but no out and out tackle tickle.  after about 15 min I asked about extras and the standard shake of the hand was indicated. Price was $20, and I asked for nude, and her starting price was $50 (including HJ), but we settled on $30.

She was wearing cut-off jeans and a black t shirt, which she promptly divested herself of, together with matching black undies.  As stated above Mina is a Chinese MILF, so had a bit of a belly but otherwise looked in reasonable shape.  On the turn over started the HJ which was OK but not particularly erotic, along with a bit of dirty talk, got me over the line fairly quickly.  Kept up the massage in nude for the last 5 minutes or so.  On the way out saw the other lady on, who might have been the Jenny mentioned by BAB, so it seems there are likely to be 2 ladies on each day. Mina said she works here, only one day a week - on Mondays.

All in all not a bad experience, not a joint to go out of your way for, but OK if in the area.

Not have had a root or tug since mid December (this bloody bug knocked me around and I didn't want to pass in on) today I decided my Penis needed draining and popped into this neat little place for a $60 Rub & $20 Tug, as I am on my way to Bondi, I asked the M.L. for an oily massage & tug and received both...they have a small Bathroom with a very hot shower, everything else is as listed about.......this is a very handy RnT

My experience/comments : A bit awkward going there because you have to walk past some small businesses and when I was going in there were two owners of those businesses outside talking and staring at me as I went in.  Obviously they know what goes on in this place.

There are 3 cubicles: they all back on to a common wall with the next unit, have office style partitions on each side which go to the roof, and a curtain for the door. The massage tables were very sturdy, clean and professional.

Only wanted to test the place out so went for 30 minutes.  A few tackle tickles and a couple "is everything ok".  Asked her how much for nude HJ.  Started off at $50 but managed to get her down to $30.  Decent HJ and she let me rub her clit and breasts and she did some moaning which pushed me over the edge.

Appears that this place may have closed down. Wandered past late last week and there was no sign of life.

This joint was owned by Shu from the castle Hill Ding therapy, she told me it was no good and she would close when the lease expired, must have expired. Shu can be found back at Ding.

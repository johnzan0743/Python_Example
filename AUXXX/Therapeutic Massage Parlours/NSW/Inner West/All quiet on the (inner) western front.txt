 All quiet on the (inner) western front
				
Post Content: 
I know that for personal reasons I haven't seen much RnT action for a couple of months and therefore can't call the kettle black but come on boys! This thread is almost moribund. Let's hear of some of the action in the local area. Even reports of repeat visits would be better than nothing! I look forward to a surge of new reviews including from me in the next little while.

Looks like my plea has fallen on deaf ears. No punts in Burwood, Ashfield, Campsie etc recently? I need some inspiration for my impending return to the RnT scene.

MB, I feel your pain.  Nothing in the area seems to inspire me to part with my cash but it would be so damn convenient if there was...

Gentlemen i called in to see mini in burwood last night on the way home, review to follow, so not a cheap RnT and also I know she may not be what you are looking for, but one to think about

Try 208 Massage Oasis. I posted a review the other day. It's a nice setup, clean with caucasian mamasan and thai girls

Reviews of many places are conspicuous by their absence these days. Doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason. As you said, the silence from Campsie in particular, is deafening.

Not quite true brother MB!

I had a fantastic session this Monday at 252b Parramatta Road Stanmore with my favourite busty Mongolian girl Amy - just came back from holiday last week! But the session was too raunchy and it belonged squarely in the Gold members lounge ! Sorry guys, I may post a tune down simplified version later !

BTW , the very beautiful , tall, slim but very busty Uni student Angela is back ! A bit more matured now and apparently very popular with some of her fans getting the mail from Coco !

Stanmore is the place where you find out what RnT is all about brothers !

Cheers

With Amanda at 3/3 Ryde Rd Hunters Hill closing, I have just noticed there is a new shop fit-out on the lower floor of the Gladesville Shopping Centre that looks like it is going to be a Massage Parlour with what I could see as either 4 or 6 rooms with doors that shut........... watch this space, I do hope it is Amanda

Just wanted to say how glad I am that the title of this thread is certainly no longer true. With regular reviews of 3 or 4 shops along Burwood Rd, the new venture at 176 Liverpool Rd and the reviews of 41 George St and Mimi there is lots of local action. Well done gents! I can't keep up with all the recommendations like I used to do in the past! Not a bad problem to have though.

There is a new Asian Massage shop at 200 Parramatta Road Stanmore # 0420964062 # 02 95608861 (just down from 208) that is advertising in the local rag as "real good whole body massage" Upon ringing them, the fare is $60 per house and when asked if they are old or young, she said both ie: the usual 22 - 26 year old student type and when asked if they do HJ, she said I ask to many questions, come and see

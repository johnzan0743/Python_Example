 Chinese Remedial Relax Massage - Shop 6/17-20 The Esplanade, Ashfield - 02 9798 8308
				
Post Content: 
Before I start, as you can see I have posted this under "Pure massage only"...let's just say I am suspicious that I just missed out...

Anyway, decided to take a punt today at this place. Haven't been there before, but had seen it advertised in The Tele under good old "Health Beauty & Fitness".

It is located just a couple of mins walk from the station, at the base of a relatively new unit block.

Upon approach it appeared to have all the signs of an "extras" establishment - no sign stating "Health Rebates Available", not appearing to be an overly professional setup, and not appearing to be targeted at women. As I got closer, the young "casually dressed" ladies I could see through the window only reaffirmed my belief I was in for some extras.

I enter...mamasan shows me to a room...asks me how long? I ask how much? Mamasan advises 30 for 30mins, 50 for 60 mins. Me say 60 mins please.

A young fairly good looking chinese girl enters the room. She is wearing 'short' shorts, a jacket over a singlet top with a hint of cleavage. This is all looking good.

I strip off, lie down and the massage begins...

She starts with my back, on to the back of the legs, works my neck...but no oil?!?! But wait, after about 30 mins with me still lying on my back...here comes the oil!! Appears we may be back on track!

The young lady gets to work massaging my back using the oil. Another 10 mins passes. Hang on, she moves to the back of my legs...will there be any tackle tickle I ask myself???

At the back end of another 10 mins of back of the leg massaging, there is the slightest tackle tickle. I am thinking that although time appears to be running out, I am still in with a shot for some extras.

She leaves the room...hot towel perhaps followed by the "roll over please" I think to myself. She returns, and yes, she has a hot towel. She wipes the oil from my body. Now just waiting for the green light.....but no...she starts massaging my bloody head!!

All this time I was unable to see the clock, so I am hoping that my 'gut feel' on how long had passed was off the mark. As it would turn out, it was just about spot on, as after about 10 mins of bloody head massaging the young girl proclaims "time's up!".

Not willing to give up that easily, thinking that this may be a ploy on her behalf to get me to pay for another half hour plus 'extras', I ask "Do you offer any extras?". No, she insists looking all shy. How about the other girls, do any of them offer extras? No, she insists even more convincingly.

God damn!!!

Insult to injury as I exiting this joint I pass 4 young ML's in the entry foyer who all look like they are dressed for a brothel.

Have I missed something? Have I developed dog breath overnight?? All these years that I've been looking into the mirror telling myself that I'm not ugly, but in fact I actually make The Elephant Man look like Miss Universe???

This place has absolutely got me stuffed!! The only theory I have left is that this girl was on her 1st day and the other girls hadn't let her into 'the secret'.

Would appreciate if anyone else has been here and can share their experiences.....

Oh well, off to King St Newtown then...

Greetings all.

Decided to take another punt at this place today...and lost.

Looking to minimise my exposure, I opted for a 30 min massage.

Mammasan led me to...an "allocated space". A room by definition has a door and 4 walls. This was 2 walls and a curtain making up the other 2 "walls". This "allocated space" also appears to double as a storage area for all sorts of miscellanous crap they couldn't find a place to put elsewhere. The area was marginally larger than the massage table itself.

I then look up to see the same ML as last time - Sunny. She instructs me to take my clothes off - I do but leave my boxers on as my past experience has made me wiser.

Anyway, Sunny begins with a reasonable massage. She is about 15 mins into it and to my surprise I discover that Sunny has employed an extra that I have never come across before, nor have I ever heard of it - sneezing on the punter. Not sure if she has put a name to this extra yet, maybe a "Saliva Shower". Now I am a firm believer of "each to their own", but this one is definitely not for me. Good news though - Sunny isn't asking for any tips for her "Salavia Showers", so if your keen you better get in early before she recognises the potential it has.

The good news is I still firmly believe that some of the girls at this joint will offer extras, the bad news is Sunny works everyday so will be hard to avoid.

It is sad to say I will no doubt return at some point to try to prove my theory...just call me a sucker...

Hi BadAussieboy,

First, to respond to the comments you made at the start of this thread and to then finish up on a more serious note.

You wrote:

Have I missed something? Have I developed dog breath overnight?? All these years that I've been looking into the mirror telling myself that I'm not ugly, but in fact I actually make The Elephant Man look like Miss Universe???

The answer to the above questions are as follows:

Yes, you probably have dog breath. When it developed no one knows?
Yes, you have been using the wrong mirror and like me are as ugly as a baboon's arse.
Yes, the Elephant man would get more extras at a cheaper price than both of us.

You wrote:

This place has absolutely got me stuffed!! The only theory I have left is that this girl was on her 1st day and the other girls hadn't let her into 'the secret'.

Would appreciate if anyone else has been here and can share their experiences

Don't feel bad mate. I've had the dandruff cleaning treatment too at an rnt.

This is a dodgy rnt and many of the ladies do exras i.e. full service.

Alice used to be the mamasan there and she'd throw any pork chop in the direction of a salivating sucker, I mean punter.

Extras are to be had my good man and when you get there choose your own lady before you get hearded into the room.

Hope this helps.

Uncle Jack

Good place with well dressed and attractive Asian women, only $50/hour. The second time I went there  the masseuse couldn't speak any English, but very attractive. They also offer body scrub. Well located and discreet. They don't appear to offer any 'extras'. Let us know of any other experiences.

Tempted again yesterday to try this place again, but thought I would adopt a different strategy...

Called in advance under the guise of checking what time they closed. Was told 9pm, then proceeded to ask if any of the girls offered any extras. Was promptly advised that the only extras they offer included remedial massage, cupping, etc etc.

So, if this place still does offer any extras, then the mamasan is either unaware or "playing with a straight bat".

Cheers,

BAB

Prices: $50 for 1 hour 

Age: about 20

Size/shape: Good size for young girl

Like BadAussieBoy I saw the ad for this in the local paper under the regular "massage" section.  So I thought I would give it a try since I regularly frequent ashfield. This was some months ago so apologies if I can't recall the gals names.  On my first visit I sussed out the front of building with its sign for massages, the typical legit ones and thought hmm is it pure only massage?  

Anyway I walked in and saw the mammasan at the counter but to the right side was a lounge where a couple of girls were seated eating and wearing seductive blouses and shorty shorty skirts. 

So I think this is a good sign. Asked the mammasan how much for 1hour. $50 was the response so I said ok and paid her the money. 
She takes me to a makeshift area with curtains as all the rooms were booked but along the way talks to a youngish girl in the corridor with jeans and jean jacket who accompanies me to this area.

So I strip and thought better ask now rather than wait until the end.  I asked her in a low voice if  she does hand/or blow job but she does not understand.  So I use sign language which is universal but a definite no no is her reply waving her hands in the process.  So I cop the massage which she only does on the back and no turn over.  So I finish, thank her (i'm polite) and leave.  On the way out the mammasan asks if everything "ok" so I just smile at her and shake my head and leave.  Mind you this was on a saturday and it was rather busy.

But I still see a girl in tight shorts seated on lounge on my way out and I'm not convinced its legit.

So I try again another time but during the week.  This time I ask for room and mamasans ok, takes me there and says to undress.  There is no girl but soon enough a knock at the door and again another youngish girl in jeans enters (different to the first girl) but was quite bubbly and smiling, quite the opposite of the first girl.

So we go through the process and wait till the end and ask her if she does HJ but giggles saying sorry no can do, and leave again in disgust not telling the mammasan it was not ok.

In the end I just gave up and simply ruled this place out.

I see others here are more successful so please enjoy, I for one will not bother returning.

hi there,

i tried this place yesterday i.e. 25th Juy, 2011.  As mentioned in the earlier posts, ladies are good and pretty plus attractive, but to no avail.  They make u horny on the massage table with their gentle touch and look but they refuse for all demands.  I was told to keep my undie on throughout the massage, which made me more frustrated.  While talking to the masseur I realised that it was her first day, may be due to that she might be reluctant.  Anyways, her name was Tiffany, F 21, uni student.

Enjoy!

I did this as a TOFTT effort. 
Girl: Nikki, age asserted as 18, probably early 20s
Cost: $50/hour
Nationality: assume PRC
Communication: consisted of three words: "Turn over" at 40 minutes, "Finished" at 55.
Price: $50
Service: massage only. No extras that I could elicit.
Note: suspect that this was the crash and burn Nikki I reviewed on 21/3/2011 ago at Everton Street, Strathfield. She sniffelled, but not as continuously as at Everton. Mamasan looked like she was also the Everton one. Wouldn't swear to any of this, though, as my memory deteriorates with age.

I gave all the right signs: got on table naked, had a serious whopper at turnover time
She didn't: covered me with a towel, ignore my Hungry Jack

Overall: a great massage. Although it seemed repetitive and uninteresting at first, I walked out of there rested and almost sleepy.
I had called ahead to ask if anyone is available (really don't want to spend time waiting or other embarassing acitivities), mamasan said Nikki and Coco, booked Niki and came right in.
As previously reviewed, the girls' dress sends the signals we look for. Nikki was in a short knitted mini-dress, with opaque tights that finished about 10cm below her dress. Those creamy thighs are so inviting. But touching her was not on the cards, nor were any other services offered

I went yesterday and opted for 30mins not expecting what to expect.

The massage wasn't that good but I tried to make conversation with her and complemented her.
About 20 mins through, I ask her softly if they do any extra, but she says it's store policy not too..
but I ask if HJ was available and she agreed.

I tipped her $20 for the HJ. All in all, I had a good time.

Post Content: 
This place is heavily reviewed on the Chinese orientated site but not on the Anglo ones and there is a good reason for this. See below.

I had a rare window of opportunity to do some hunting in Ashfield this evening so I headed to 18 Hercules St to see April. When I got there it all looked closed up but not locked so I knocked and someone came out and said they were busy. In desperation I headed towards 274 Liverpool Rd and saw a quite sexy MILF just closing up. I was across the road from 295 but this place is far too public and I didn't real want FS. Rather foolishly I decided to give Alice's place another chance after previous very poor experiences here and in Strathfield. I went in and was given a very pretty and sexy young thing in shortie shorts. She proceeded to give me a very poor massage and when the time was up she said finished and walked out. I was actually expecting something like this and had been getting tense rather than relaxed during the massage.
Alice came to see me out and asked about the massage. I said " I don't know why you don't just put up a sign saying ' No whites allowed'. She said 'Was the massage no good?' and then realised it was about extras. She said, 'This place is massage only' and I replied "Hundreds of reviews on the internet would dispute that' and she said ' Lot's of people lie.' I felt like saying that you are the fucking liar but restrained myself. Anyway it was only $30 lost but a rare opportunity to get out in the early evening was wasted. Stay away if you are anglo. If you are asian I believe there is a lot on the menu.

I have only visited once and got the same treatment as you, but as I was leaving, in at least 2 of the other rooms, the all to famiilar sounds of squeaking massage tables, heavy breathing and light moaning (by female) were heard as clear as day.

Its a shame too because this shop is full of hotties, most of them very young and horny. They think all us aussies work for the Council and/or BrotherBusters.

I used to visit this place a lot in the past, and the pattern was $30 for half an hour, but usually much shorter than that. That included a HJ. $20 for nude. Girls varied from great to hopeless.
Went there again recently. Alice recognised me. Same story - $30 for short half hour with HJ plus nude including touching for an extra $20.
Maybe the policy has changed. Maybe you all look suspicious to the cautious Alice. Maybe it's my charm?

Talking to Alice:

Went here this morning. Before negotiating anything, I called Alice aside. We went into a room, I told her that I was neither from council nor a journalist, and asked if extras could be available. I would have shown her my work ID as proof, if she had asked, but - after I mentioned internet reviews (in general) - she said that there is a lot of shit on the internet.

I am frustrated and annoyed. The girls are babes, but we cannot get them. I am seriously of the view that we should post some of the reviews from other sites on her door and to Ashfield Council, as already suggested by someone. I want a decent massage by a hottie, instead of the older ladies around Ashfield. I am frustrated. Thoughts, guys?

Bob the earlier suggestion to BOYCOTT this place is the best option. Foolishly as punters we shoot ourselves in the foot by not using the power of AUS XXX and banding together to shape the industry THAT WE KEEP ALIVE. If you had read the earlier reviews and stuck by the others then Alice would have to contemplate making amends to the AUS XXX members if she was to get our service again. By splintering off and thinking that "this won't happen to me" only allows Alice to continue with her behaviour. Have you ever thought someone from that establishment is putting up the reviews just to draw customers even if they under false pretenses?

Of course their is a policy of indifference towards non Asians at some of the Asian brothels. I have witnessed this many times as I have gone punting with an Asian mate of mine. I stand behind him when he presses the buzzer and they let him in unencumbered but as soon as they see me then they want to change the prices, restrict the service, claim unavailability or say they are about to close. I have experienced this behaviour some 3 years ago at Angel Town and at the old management of 647 Elizabeth Redfern. I did however stay at Angel Town because I stated that I would take the matter to the Anti Discrimination Board. When I did see the girl the big issue was over the "White Man" size of penis. She was scared of getting ripped up inside. The other reason is that some Asian customers don't like seeing girls that have been fucking non Asians. I don't know why but I gather they like their girls to be "princesses" and not given a workout. My Asian mate conferred that these truly are the reasons.

But of course I may just have been lucky.   However, since I regularly try a variety of shops, I doubt that.

I have another Ashfield place with a very good massage for $30 where $20 gets me a very enthusiatic FS - with the door locked and mouth biting my shoulder to keep her quiet.

Well, I've finally done it.
Saw Lisa today, 24 years old, from Shenyang, in Australia for two weeks and studying English. Nice body, a little puppy fat, but a nice girl. She was cold when I first came in, but then opened up as we talked and I tried my atrociously pathetic Mandarin.

She gave a good massage, With the backwalking thing as well, but I had to ask her not to walk on my sensitive back.

As she massaged me from the sides, I caressed her legs, eventually sliding my figure inside her shorts. None of her clothes came off, but she looked a little tired, so I gave her a bit of a massage and kissed her back. She's a sweet girl, eventually as she massaged me on the front, I took the little Doctor in hand, and she asked me whether I would like some assistance.

She provided it. She has some learning to do, but is friendly and has a nice attitude. When I squeezed her butt, she made no comment. When I squeezed her breasts, she told me I was naughty and pushed my hand away gently. I think with time there might be some more here.

Yay, a breakthrough!!

Lisa works Fridays and Saturdays. The rate for an hour is now 60. I tipped her 50. She asked me whether I would be back next week; I remained non-committal.

I've been here a few times now. The first two times was a couple of months ago and both times the girls never offered anything extra, just finished the massage and said times up. I thought it was the fact that I spoke English despite being Asian.

A few weeks ago I thought I'd just try again, so in I went and didn't like the look of the first girl there, the second girl looked nicer so asked for her. Her name was Angie. She gave me a decent massage and near the halfway mark she quietly asks if I wanted a HJ. Of course I wasn't about to say no  :P

She grabs the oil bottle and also offers to take her clothes off, again I accepted. She's got a nice body, B cups, but unshaven pussy. She was ok with me licking her nipples, which she seemed to enjoy. She then got a wet wipe and cleaned my dick off. What happened next totally surprised me. She took me into her mouth and proceeded to give a slow wet BBBJ. I was so surprised, I asked her if she was ok and she nodded. I was totally turned on by this and was rock hard. This went on for a few mins then she got the oil and started with the HJ. After jerking me off for a few mins she even more quietly asks if I wanted to have sex. I wasn't sure what she was saying so I asked her to repeat. She whispers, "Do you want to make love?" I asked how much... she replied $50. Hmmm, I thought about it and nodded yes in about 2 seconds.

She produced a condom from her bag and puts it on me. Lays down on the massage table and I enter her enthusiatically. She was tall enough that I could enjoy her breasts with my mouth without having to contort too much, and she felt nice and tight as well. Didn't take long before I blew.

Total cost was $35 for 30mins + $50 for FS (including BBBJ and nude). So $85 all up.

Face - 7/10
Massage - 7/10
Premises - 7/10
BBBJ - 8/10

The second time I went (a week after the first) I picked her again and we went through the same motions. However this time, I asked her to BBBJ me again after having sex in various positions, she was happy to oblige. I was being nice and even told her I was cumming while she was still blowing but she continued and took it all in her mouth, didn't even slow down. OMG, I was so surprised and it felt so good. She spat in some tissues and I asked her after if she was ok with me cumming in her mouth. She giggled and said it was good for her, wow.

I did see her again and ended with another CIM.

The third time I had to wait for a bit before she was available, seems the Asian guys who go there sit in the waiting area after their massage is finished and have a chat. Not sure if they knew each other or what, but they all came out and started talking, had a smoke or whatever, just hung around. Saw a couple of Caucs come in, dunno if they got the same special treatment or not.

This is a review of Angie, at the Explanade Ashfield. She is as described earlier by Snapjaw.

They don't call it punting for nothing (but thanks anyway, Snapjaw). I phoned up and asked for Angie, asking when she would be available. They asked when I'm coming. I said now:- Angie's free. I came in, and Angie is easy on the eye; as she went into the room, she was very quiet, almost disapproving - as the girls here always are; I guess they think "Anglo, not allowed to make money by offering extras...".

Angie asked me how many times I have been there before. I said three or four. She asked me how I knew her name. I said from a friend. She immediately launched into a little comment about how you shouldn't believe everything you read. She's only been here three months, staying until July, and already she is clued up as to how it works!!

The massage was very good. At half an hour, I extended to 60m. It ended up costing me $60 all up.

Angie did not move away when I touched her hands or her upper thighs. I'm lying on my front the whole time. There was no turnover. But during the second 30 minute, when I ask her to focus on my legs, I did start getting aroused. It was obvious to her that I was aroused, with my bum rhythmically moving up and down, slowly pushing my cock into the table. She paused a few times as if a bit unsure as to what to do.

Although nothing happened this time, I suspect that an investment might well pay off. She did complement me on my crotchless undies. Mind you, given that there was no turnover, she only noticed them when I was getting dressed.

I think another visit is called for. But remember, these girls are very careful, especially given Ashfield Council's attitude. And I must say that the  massage was very relaxing. 

I know that it feels like hitting your head up against a brick wall, but I will be back to see Angie.

Chinese Massage
Shop 6/17-20 The Esplanade
Ashfield
9798 8308

How do you get there?
Next to Ashfield Railway Station (Liverpool St side) above the Brown Street parking station

What was the place like?
next door to a medical centre below a residential building next to the railway line.
Nice clean place, looks very Legit.

How did it all happen?
My favourite Ashfield shop has closed, so I thought I would go back to this shop and try my luck.
A friend of mine (asian heritage) insists that many extras are available here, although for the record, I have been to this place too many times to count, even name dropping, with all visits unsuccessful in negotiating HJ let alone anything else. 

She was standing looking out the glass door as I approached, she looked really nice so just had to go in.

What about the girl?
A very cute, very sexy young asian girl, slim, mid length straight black hair, maybe 'b' cup, shorty shorts, tight black top and apricot/pink cardigan.
looked to be very early 20's & very friendly.

What was her name?
She didn't seem ready when i asked her name, she thought about it for a few seconds of uncomfortable silence and blurted out Lisa while laughing.
Quite funny, I don't really care for names, I only ask to be polite and it helps with consistency of the reviews. I know they are all made up. 

Availability?
Was there Tuesday
Not sure of the other days, if you want to see her probably best to phone ahead and give a description.

What was provided & Quality??
A gentle relaxing massage with minimal oil for 1/2 Hour only
I knew this was only going to be straight massage when she pushed up her sleaves instead of taking off her cardigan and the way she was positioned.

Price?
$35 total spend

Any extras available?
She said that her boss won't allow it.

Cleanup?
Not required, no HJ and virtually no oil residue

Would you go back?
$35 was a very small price for the time spent with this beautiful girl, so why not if I was in the mood, although my search for a new place continues.

I hope this review proves useful for my fellow punters.

Reluctant as I am to give this fucking hole any more publicity I must say to FF that there are a number of options in the Ashfield/Burwood area if you want a younger woman who gives HJs only as an extra. I don't don't want to list them all here as there are reviews for all of them on the site but I am happy to recommend any to members who are interested in this locale.

The Esplanade Ashfield.
Went here 3 PM, Sunday, 14 October.
Girl: wendy
Source: mid 20s, slim, MLC.
Short story: this place is genuine massage only. Do not expect anything else.

I came in at 3 PM to see Wendy. It was obvious that something was possible; she was wearing a leopardprint thong, which was just visible beneath her jeans, and a lacy top, which was hidden under what I think  was a tracksuit top. Let's face it, the massage is crap (unless done by the mamasan). This means that they must be making their money from something else.

I booked in for half an hour for $35. No matter that I was responsive, or that I brushed my hand against her thighs, nothing was going to happen. I've had enough of this place.
When I tried to engage her in conversation, Wendy gave me in the standard, accented "I no speak English". Bullshit.

I go to this place because of the probability of the punt not being 100%, introducing excitement into the process. However, going back to high school mathematics, the limit of X as N approaches infinity, where X is any sexual service and N is number of visits --> ZERO.

I give up! The two successful punts I had here were great. But it's just not worth it to keep hunting here. I decided to go elsewhere. It turns out that Judy's place in Ashfield had a sign saying it was her day off. No luck for Dr Bob.
So I headed to Croydon (see Jade).

SYD99. It has a Chinese and an English language site. Most of the contributors are asians I think but not all. I don't contribute to it anymore because any one can read the reviews without being a member. I know your frustration. When I went to the Strathfield shop I was treated badly by ML ladies who knew they couldn't get any more money out of me because of house rules. I got a terrible massage and surly service. Just go to other places. 95 Edwin St in Croydon has a very sexyl woman called May who works on Mondays/Fridays. HJs only I think but she is friendly and always kisses me. Quite passionate.

Value for money/recommend? : Unsure. Hit & Miss 

My experience/comments :

I've been visiting this place quite infrequently for some years. Long enough to know better but also long enough for Alice to get to know me. I'm on her daily updates as to who's who and when. 

Before she sold her shop in strathfield I was introduced to young Melody. A quiet reluctant type but who wasn't scared of a full frontal. Her massage was poor but there was enough tackle tickle for me to persevere. By our third session she agreed to HJ me for $20. She tugged me like she was my GF. She never uttered a word but looked at my knob intently. Yesterday she wasn't up to the task as she had a cold. Her massage was worse than usual and while she played with my donger, there was no HJ. Her cold made her spit repeatedly on the floor and she would toss tissues she wiped her nose with onto the growing puddle. Not a great experience. 

So I picked up my bat and balls and hoofed it to Judy's on Hercules for welcome relief. Nevertheless I did see a couple on Melody's workmates whom I'm willing to tag and release. I don't know why I keep going back. Maybe it's the stubborn mule in me...

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese 

Services:5/10 massage, 7-8/10 HJ

Value for money/recommend? Ok for a change of scene. 

My experience/comments: I'm a sucker for punishment and have visited this place infrequently but often enough to be known to Alice (mamasan). I get the daily roster but this is nothing to crow about. 

Alice introduced me to Melody before she sold her Strathfield shop. 

Melody was shy, studious like, but wasn't afraid of a full frontal. This was a good sign. Her massages are average at best but I persevered over some time to gain her confidence and more tackle tickle. By my 3rd visit she was tugging me like she was my girlfriend. Generous stroke and plenty ball cupping. She liked to clean me up thoroughly and milk me as much as possible. Great fun!

She went on holidays to China having retuned to active duty recently. I went back there yesterday but she had a cold and was even more distant than usual. Despite plenty of fondling, no HJ. Damn! To make matters worse, her condition had her spitting on the floor which she covered by tossing tissues she wiped her nose with. Not pleasant. 

I picked up my oiled bat and balls and hoofed it to Judy's on Hercules St for relief. 

I did espy some other interesting WL at the Esplanade so I'll be back TTOFTT, again.

Date of Visit : 11AM 18/04/2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 6/17-20 The Esplanade Ashfield NSW

Hours of Business : 10-7

Rates : $60 p/h

Age : Older, probably 30ish

Size/shape : C cup probably

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, HJ extra

Value for money/recommend? : Reasonable

My experience/comments :

Went to check out this place for a massage in Ashfield, and when I got in there were quite a few girls standing around. I gestured that I wanted a massage and I was ushered into the closest room, by the owner and a girl(not of my choosing) followed. Inside the room, the owner asked me what I wanted, I said a one hour massage, and then ponied up the $60 for the hour. 

The owner then left and then it was me and the massage girl. I asked her what her name was, she said crystal, and that was the only thing I was able to get out of her. Didn't speak a lick of english. Anyways, I took my clothes off and jumped on the table. The massage was a bit soft, but it was definitely what I was after being tired from the week

Towards the end, the girl didn't mention anything about extras so I attempted to communicate again. She didn't understand so she got her boss in, when I was stark naked no less. The boss mentioned that I had 10mins left, did I want to continue? Why wouldn't I. I said yes and then she closed the door. Next, I used hand gestures to see what extras she could give. She agreed to a HJ with a $20 tip, which i thought was excessive given the reputation of the place. I ponied up and it was ok, but I probably could've done with just the massage.

Average.

However if you are not Asian - do not bother. You will not get extras.
The boss had ordered all girls not to provide extras including HJ unless they are Asian. This has been going on for years and years.
I am half Asian and still she wont trust me, so I don't go there.

The receptionist urged me into a room without picking a girl and asked YangYang to followed me.
When I entered the room, I can hear someone next door moaning loudly..
Anyway YangYang is around early 30 with C cup and petite.
Started off with massage and the massage was slightly poor but not too bad as she allowed me to touch her when massage.
20mins later I turned around and she started the part 2 with extrasss..
Part 2 make up for the weak massage and 15mins later, happy man

No offense Blueballs but that's bullshit. Maybe as a long established customer you have got certain rights but there is no doubt it is very difficult for non-Asians to get extras here. This is the only RnT shop in Sydney where I have been knocked back on extras. It is not me, or the many others who have complained about the policies of this shop. It's Alice.

Def still open, you can see it from a train when going past. It's next to a Chinese medical centre not a bookstore and it's the shop closest to the railway tracks underneath that newish apartment block.

Looks like you have to be fob Chinese (speak mandarin) to get fs here and pick the right girl as well, usually the over 30s ones. I've been going on and off since 2008, fs every time except for a few punts where Alice slipped me a dud. I started telling her up front I wanted sex and no massage which seems to have solved the problem

Well, someone please tell me I have the wrong place (obviously I must). I was back in Ashfield today and went to this building - the shop is empty with a "for lease" sign in the window. I took a photo which I can't upload, but I'll gladly show it off if someone can point me in the right direction from where I'm getting lost.
This has become a bit of a challenge for me now, even if the other reviews have been less than generous. I'll take one for the team just so I can say I've been there.
I'll be in Ashfield again in two weeks. I'll have a better look then, but this picture would've at least shown why I'm having no luck.
I believe you fellows that it's still there, I just can't locate it. Heard about the useless man who can't get a root in a brothel? This Canadian can't even find the brothel!

Relax canuck. Too many beavers have blinded you. Perhaps you're visiting Jessica acupuncture & massage centre which is shop 2C/17-20. Alice and her non-tuggers to white fellas are around the corner in shop 6...for the record, I've got a couple of tugs there and I'm not asian nor Caucasian. Having said that, Alice is a crafty cow who pulls nothing but strings and has slipped me more duds than Australian test batsmen so I give this shop a wide berth...visit Judy and Lisa on Hercules St or Jessie at 287 Liverpool Rd...

Indeed very strange. I'm Chinese and can't speak Canto/Mando yet have no probs getting fs when I've visited here. Admittedly only with the one girl (coz of her fantastic boobs) but I have no doubt I could get it from others if I asked. Been a while since I've gone there but Alice still sends me the daily roster by text.

Been a while since I've gone there but Alice still sends me the daily roster by text. I don't know her rationale for choosing which customer to service (apart from non-Asians) but I'm just happy I'm in her green zone

I am guess the spelling of her name starts with an A......

Ah thanks for the info but I'm a bit confused here. You sound like you know the girls but earlier on I read that you are not visiting the place because you get knocked back for extras? I take it you get the roster as well that means?

Knock back for extra??? Not me man.....

This place and strathfield is most likely the best in inner west now. 110-120 and you got a massage and fuck a not so old gal. Sometimes still hit and miss though. But overall good.

Person's Name : Lanlan

Establishment : Chinese remedial relax massage shop 6/ 17-20 the esplanade ashfield 02-9798-8308

Date of Visit : 13-03-2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Chinese remedial relax massage shop 6/ 17-20 the esplanade ashfield 02-9798-8308

Hours of Business : 9am till 10pm

Rates : $60 per hour

Age : 23

Size/shape : C cup, athletic 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : HJ $20, nude for extra

Value for money/recommend? : Crap massage but enjoyed the HJ

My experience/comments:

After a long hiatus I returned to this place recently. Alice must have been happy to see me because I have been serviced by Yuan Yuan and Coco and both provided me with HEs.  Yuan Yuan even offered to strip off for an additional $10 and let me play with her cat. Out of the 2, Coco gave the better massage but was too firm with her yank. 

So anyway I booked well in advance for a late arvo release. I get the daily texts from Alice but I didn't specify the ML in my booking.  

When I rocked up I was greeted by a real cutie named Lanlan. Yuan Yuan was also there. Lanlan showed me to a room and I started to peel off layers. 

Then it all went wobbly. Alice yelled something out to LL and she dashed out apologising. Then YY darted in. Then Alice yelled again and YY darted out. I was there starkers juggling my balls in full view of a smiling Alice staring at me from the lobby. 

So I calmly lay on the table and waited until the confusion dissipated. Soon after LL walks in all apologetic but sweet. Man, is she cute. 

LL massage is iffy at best. She's studying English and is banging a bloke with a huge donger but not much else. 

Anyway, after 30min she flips me over and suggestively asks if I'm up for a HE. Of course! 

Her technique wasn't too bad and my only regret was that I didn't pay the extra to see her in the buff. I'll certainly be going that extra $30 next time.  LL let me feel her form and she was all taut and terrific. She wears her hair long and has a ready and radiant smile. English is passable despite arriving in the very near past. She loves a chat and is very friendly, which is unusual for that establishment. 

At the 45min mark Alice yells again and LL tells me it's over. The hell it isn't! She tells me another ML will make up the hour.  LL had just got me over the line and had cleaned me up so she was massaging my legs and making chit chat, but left in a rush. In walks another ML. Confusion reigns for another few seconds. Then that 2nd ML walks out and LL returns. Chinese punters get preferential treatment, so some dude had to decide he didn't want LL BEFORE she could finish with me. Ah the joy!

As is usual for Alice's girls, don't expect a good massage. Or even a good tug. And definitely expect dodgy service or even mayhem from Alice herself. But that's 3 HJs in 3 visits and maybe there's a nugget among her harem... 

LL works weekends but she was filling in for a colleague. 

BTW, I heard Alice try to sell her girls to an English speaking caller.  So maybe Alice is expanding into the non-Asian market. I'm living proof. 

Is it all worth it? Well, there's only one way to find out!

Nice info HT. I have been to Alice's numerous times (not in the last 2 years) though and have never received HJ.
I would be interested in any other non-Asians have received HJ in recent times before I make the long drive to Ashfield.

BTW The times I went there there was like 4-5 Asian guys with the ML's inside smoking Cigararettes, it was like walking into a bushfire. Are they still smoking in the front room?
Cant believe they are able to do this in this day and age

 Chinese Remedial Relax Massage - Shop 6/17-20 The Esplanade, Ashfield - 02 9798 8308
				
Post Content: 
Warning to all brothers, level of service at this establishment may vary according to your ethnicity and demeanor (i.e don't dress like council/cop). I'm posting to try to get to Silver and also for the jerk off benefits for other bros. I've been a regular to this shop since 2008

Person's Name : Yuan yuan

Establishment : Alices Massage

Date of Visit : 7 June and a month a bit before thatl

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 6, 17-20 Esplanade, Ashfield. Corner shop closest to railway under new apartment block

Hours of Business : 11am to 8 or 9pm every day

Rates : 35 for 30 mins. 45 for 45 mins. Not sure how much an hour is - probs around 55

Age : 35

Size/shape : Size 8, good body but unfortunately A cup tits

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, BBBJ, DATY, Fingering, FS, light kissing

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

I have a thing for chinese mifls, the ones you see in the shopping centres or on trains. They look so innocent and dress conservatively in public but are usually quick to take off their clothes and jump you behind closed doors. I've visited this girl twice and masturbated to my memories of her many more times. I do have a rule about punting which is never to see the same woman more than 2x so it's time to move on but I'll write it all down here first.

Walked in on a Sun afternoon and got ushered directly into the room by Alice the mamasan who then pushed this girl Yuan yuan into the room as well. She's not the prettiest bird, her face is around a 6.5 but there's something sexy about her look. I knew this was gonna be a good fuck straight away but played along with the massage act.

I got fully naked and lay on the table while she put a half hearted effort at letting her hands wander over my body for about 5 minutes. I took it as an invitation to start feeling her up straight away, touching her stockinged legs, her butt. Her massage quickly turned into tickle tackle and I could feel the blood rushing to my groin. She asks me if I want to have sex and without me answering she starts undressing while I turn over. I feel her all over as she's taking off her clothes next to the massage table, her skin is smooth as silk and flawless. She trims her pussy hair and shaves around her lips.

She climbs onto the table and grabs my rock hard cock and starts giving me a BBBJ. Haven't had one of these for a while and I'm loving it. She slowly caresses it with her tongue while it's in her mouth and she looks at me at the same time. After a while she comes up for a bit of a cat bath and puts the dom on and sits on my cock without lube, she's wet herself. We do a bit of cowgirl but the type where she's got her body pressed on top of mine and I thrust in and out of her extremely tight pussy. 

I can't hold it when I'm underneath so I flip her over so she's on her back, I feel like I want to come badly so instead of puttir ng it in her straight away for mish I give her body a catbath and work my way down to her juicy cunt and eat her out. While I'm eating her out I start fingering her at the same time. She's loving it. Her pussy is wet so I slide 2 fingers in and then 3 fingers just to widen the hole a bit more, it's like a sphincter. 

I don't want to hold my own orgasm anymore so I get back up and slide my cock all the way into her pussy and start thrusting and pumping really hard till I come inside her (inside the dom) because her wimpering sends me over the edge and just lay on top of her for a while. 

It's these sorts of experiences that make punting fun. I went back again to repeat the whole experience, the 2nd time I did a bit of doggy too.Yuan yuan's a lovely fuck, works every day except Sat/Mon. Tipped her $70 - the going rate at this place is $50 which is what I usually tip if I get a standard experience.

Person's Name : Yang yang

Establishment : Alices Massage

Date of Visit : A few weeks ago on a Saturday afternoon

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 6, 17-20 Esplanade, Ashfield. Corner shop closest to railway under new apartment block

Hours of Business : 11am to 8 or 9pm every day

Rates : 35 for 30 mins. 45 for 45 mins. Not sure how much an hour is - probs around 55

Age : Early 30s

Size/shape : Size 8/10 bit chubby around the waist but hides it well. Heavy-ish B cup tittes which were nice to play with. Young face, milky white skin

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, CBJ, FS

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

I'm trying to find out who provides FS in this place, so far the list is Yuan yuan, Yang yang and Apple who I'll review in my next post. Girl in question was yang yang, she's somewhat well known cos I've seen her name bandied about in other forums. I walked in on a Saturday afternoon, there were a few girls sitting around but she was the one who welcomed me in and she gave me that knowing look so I nodded and went to the room with her. She is definitely no more than very early 30s, she has a sweet face with a hint of worldly naughtiness, just the type I like. I steer clear of the younger girls in this shop cos they're a waste of time

Paid the $35 for half an hour. Massage was...well it was so shit I can't remember anything about it. Decided to get all her clothes off, FS was $50 extra, happy to pay. She had a bit more belly fat than I'd like to have seen but her legs and arms were well toned and she had nice skin which made up for it. Had quite a long CBJ, bit of cow girl and I prematurely blew my load before i was able to go hard cos her pussy was too tight in cowgirl.

I might see her again one day, overall experience was 7/10

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

Half an hour massage today, this is one of the better part 1 massages I had, the kneading on my back was not so random and she put a bit of strength into it, better than I can say for most other girls who work here. 

She asked me what i want for part 2 and i said full package but she told me that she was on her rags today, she generally offers it but she was actually on her rags. Opted for a clothed HJ cos i was tired and just wanted to have a massage and have someone clean my pipes for me coz i'm too lazy to do it myself.

She gave me an oily HJ while I felt her up underneath her top and got to put my hand inside her bra. While she doesn't have much in the way of different techniques for the up-and-down motion she has just the right speed and pressure to simulate a wet cunt so I enjoyed it and blew my load after 5 minutes. Cleaned me up, she cheated on time a bit, only got 25 mins out of my 30. Gave her a $25 tip for the effort cos I really felt up her nipples to get my cock hard enough to come.

I've seen comment elsewhere that FS is only on for cats that look Chinese or perhaps are Mandarin or Cantonese speakers.

I must include in my small talk with these girls the question 'do you fuck westerners' from now on and report back. At the very least I think you need to be very regular. I've heard of chinese looking guys being turned down if they are new.

I have been going to this shop since it opened in 2007 and early on I was given girls who couldn't massage, couldn't give a HJ for shit (and declined FS) but I kept persisting with punting here for that one milf who'd be a hot fuck.

My experience/comments: Had heard reports that this place was hard to get any extras from so wanted to see for myself. Had been once over 6 months ago and this was the case. Was not given a choice back then and got given a very average looking girl and didnt bother getting her name. Turned up and this time, Alice was not there. There were 1 girl on the sofa and another came from the first room who tried to take me. Said i wanted the girl on the sofa who was better looking. Laid on table nude and she started the massage undraped. Got asked the usual questions about have you been here before. Rattled off a few names i had seen on the roster and also one that i had seen on the way out last time. Massage was ok with only a few brushes around the balls. Turned over and asked for a HJ which she said they didnt do there. I said i had gotten them before and described the girl i saw on the way out last time. Had to show her Alices personal number saved in my phone and then she agreed to a HJ. HJ was quite good. Took it slow and let me touch her body over her clothes. Pretty sure she would do more but that was all i was after. Was wearing a body hugging dress that showed off her body nicely.

Alas MB, Alice still presiding over her cauldron in Ashfield. I'm not Chinese either and I too found this place hit & miss with extras. 

I see that Melody is still there (and still 18 from Alice's daily roster txt). She was always good for a tug. Her massage was crap but her tug was OK for a lobster. She also spoke better English than the average ML which I find makes the experience richer. But that's just me. 

I reckon there's better value around the corner at 304 Liverpool Rd.

I was going to Ashfield to eat dumplings. Parked in the council car park and out of curiosity I checked this place and it was opened. Mamasan saw me checking out the sign and gave me the sales pitch. I told her I would be back and went to eat.

After my feast of dumplings I went to Ashfield mall to get some money out before heading back. My temperature was checked and I asked to see the room first. It looked clean and the lady inside looked pretty enough. She was wearing a hoodie and skin tight fake leather pants. I was sure I was going to get a happy ending but then Mamasan comes in and gets the money off me and tells me the lady speaks no English and to leave my underwear on.

I didn't mind the legit firm massage as I was tight. I was paranoid about putting my head in the hole so just laid my face on the side.

It was nice but not the best legit massage I have ever had so wouldn't go back again.

This place has been offering sexual services for many years. However, the boss, Alice is very suspicious of non-Chinese customers and most will get nothing but a massage. I believe some Anglo customers have got more but it is not the norm. In 3 visits over a couple of years  I got massages only. Feel free to try your luck. I don’t know your ethnic origins.

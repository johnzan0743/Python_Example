A new RnT has just opened, well I think it's one as it is just up the road from 110A Victoria Road which is defiantly a RnT 
Parking is a bugger on Victoria Rd with it being a clearway until 10am then from 3pm - 7pm BUT there is parking up the Ramp which is the old Jim Jeffrey Boat Sales yard.

The SeaRay popped in to this new RnT near OTTO's Fishing shop on Saturday to check it out only to find the old Chinese Bird from the Gladesville Plaza RnT running it.
Had a quick $40 per 1/2 hour massage followed by a $20 tug which was nothing special.

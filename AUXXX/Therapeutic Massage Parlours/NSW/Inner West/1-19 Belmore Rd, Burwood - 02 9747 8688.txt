I have had this place on my list of places to visit for awhile as it is close to home and convenient. It is a dump with cubicles that only have curtains. When I arrived there were two rather unattractive young woman in a room doing their homework/study. An interesting start. They quickly introduced me to JoJo who looks about 16/17 but claims she is 20. I am not sure she is this old. She told me that she had been robbed the night before at Parramatta Station and she had been at the Police Station until 5 o'clock this morning and this is why she yawned through the whole massage. Anyway she then gave me probably the most half baked massage I have ever had with no sign of any extras. At the very end she asked me if I wanted anything else massaged and I said , of course, and I got a very perfunctory HJ and she sat far enough away so I couldn't really touch her. Anyway, I feel rather uncomfortable with women this young because of my age and my work. The massage was $55 and I gave her $20 for the HJ so this was an expensive dud. I wish I had gone to Dr Li's in George St. I won't go back here. Come back 176.  I miss you!

I am sorry but I didn't get any other information such as phone number or opening hours but I think it is the standard 10 til 6/7 ish. If you really want to try this place, just turn up and try your luck.

I had a half hour spare in Burwood today and as I wasn't too fussed about what I got, I thought I would try this place again. Well it was pretty much the same as the last visit. A slim and quite attractive young student who came from Hong Kong. She had no massage skills at all and then after about 15 minutes she asked me straight-out  if I wanted a HJ. I didn't really care but said OK if she wanted the tip. Her technique wasn't terrible but was nothing special. She spoke English well and is doing Accountancy at Macquarie Uni. They seem to specialise in young students here so if that is your thing, then try them out. I don't think any other extras available here but I haven't asked and they certainly haven't been offered.

God, isn't insanity defined as doing the same thing and expecting a different result.

I have been sniffing around Burwood for a couple of days to find a place advertised at 3A Burwood Rd but can't find any evidence of a massage shop being at this location. So as I was driving back along Burwood Rd I remember this place and decide to give it a go. The ML was Mimi, a young and reasonably attractive TAFE student. However, as usual at this place the massage was shit. There is no erotic element. Just turn over and do you want a HJ. Is the pope a fucking catholic? Anyway, unusually she did offer to strip but for $50. Stupidly, after a nanoseconds thought,  I agreed to this and a strip turned out to be top only. Jeans left on. Got about 10 seconds of sucking her largish and attractive breasts and a very poor HJ. Don't really now how this place survives but there is much better around. MB

I was around the area last week and decided to pop into this one to try it out, first time here. A bit confusing because apparently when you go up the stairs and turn right, there is an office door which has the sign 'tax accountants' on it and I sort of glanced in and saw a couple of girls talking but thought they were doing taxes so just walked on forward in the corridor but didn't see anyone else in the rooms. After a few seconds a girl came up to me and asked 'massage?'. I took her offer, she was young and cute, a bit plumpy but more curvy than fat. As she was bending over the little bedside to get out the massage table cover, I could see her panties, which was a real turn on, she was wearing a little dress only and I was like, wow, can't believe she must have been in that tax office dressed like that! Half an hour of medium massage (even though I asked for hard, but didn't matter in the end) and some pleasant small talk, at the end of the 30mins I heard her manager saying time was up in Mandarin. Presumably that what he was saying because that's what she told me straight after, lol. I was a bit surprised she didn't offer HJ and was asking her what she offered. She agreed to extend another 15mins + nude HJ for $50 so I went with that.

She started off using lube instead of oil and as expected it 'dried' up quickly so she had to use more. While she was rubbing me off I took the opportunity to get her nearest available nipple into my mouth and licking and flicking over it with my tongue and got it hard quickly. I don't know if that turned her on or what happened next was part of her nude HJ service because she started licking the head of my little bro then just completely engulfed it in her mouth. Wow was I surprised because I was totally not expecting that, I thought she'd give it a wipe or whatever first, but no. Kept going with the BJ, felt so awesome, the pressure, suction, sensation and depth was amazing, I couldn't hold back and just came in a few mins and she took it all in her mouth. There was a sink next to the bed (convenient!) which she used to wash out. Wow. Felt great and for only $80/45mins which could have been $65/30mins if I'd asked sooner for massage, great value for BBBJ with CIM, hands down beats a normal nude HJ for me 

Turns out the 'tax office' next door was actually their reception, lol. Anyway, 9/10. Cute girl (sorry I never got her name, in that mind blank after the BJ I forgot to ask), great BBBJ, awesome value. Would return (for her specifically).

Sounds like the tax man or in this case woman gave you a nice big fat bonus which of course you deposited in the right place.

I went pass this joint a couple of Sundays ago to check it out for the first time, I must admit I was perplexed how the Mamasan office was located in the same room where the tax accountant sign was hanging on the door. The Mamasan asked if I wanted a massage, (well I wasn't here to lodge my tax return) and all of a sudden a kind of young Asian ML walked in the 'Tax office' room and was told by the Mamasan she was the only one available. As I mentioned she did look quite young, I mean bordering on the 17/18 age bracket, but I did accept and she lured me to a room. She was on the petite side, sweet voice, although she had a minor acne explosion on her face. As for the room, well, I have seen worse looking R'nT rooms but I wasn't here for a building inspection.  She asked me how long will I like to stay I opted for a 30mins/$30 session. But man, did she look young, I asked for her age and told me she was 20, I told her..'You look younger....', and she just giggled back, so, I got undressed and laid down on the dodgy massage table.   

I was asked if it was ok, if  'brand name' Baby oil could be applied to me ( and said yeah, no problem) and she started with a light-medium massage (even though I asked for more like a medium-hard massage). We went through the standard ML introduction chat...e.g Where are you from in China, where do you study, do you like near by, do you like living on Sydney...yadi, yadi, ya..

After the 15 minutes mark I was still not asked to turn over, you know, in other circumstances, I would asked pop the question if you extras, but admittedly, my  paranomia thoughts were asking me if I wanted a underage girl to jerk me off. Time was ticking away and then I heard  the Mamasan mentioning 'time up' in Chinese. The ML told me that 'no more time left' and I got up and got dressed. I did ask why you didn't massage my front, she told me ' you never ask me if I want to massage front..' 

So, this time my paranoia got the better off me and I said my goodbye and I was an my way, honestly, I completely forgotten her name, which doesn't bother me.  Will try this joint again and hoping a get a different ML that looks a bit  older, I think the trick here is you need to ask the 'extra' question while waiting to be asked to flip over.  Ah well, not to worry, a mispunt but heck, no need to stress about as there other options available in this big City..

A previous review of mine also indicates that I also had a very young ML. Probably under 20. That seems quite common here but I have always been asked about a HJ. You shouldn't have to ask for it yourself. Really the massages are crap and the HJ is the only reason these girls are here as far as I can see. Never been offered any of the extras outlined in one of the previous reviews.

This is a double review, the first of two double reviews reporting on my visits to 1/19 Belmore Road.

Name: Nellie
date: 8 September, 2013
age: early 20s
figure: slighty chubby
from: MLC
service: great massage, 50/h
contact: A:1/19 Belmore Road, Burwood; P:02-9747-8688; E:19bemore@gmail.com
works most days, mainly mornings (around study)

I came in for my first time here, and was assigned Nellie. She was a bit shy and seemed sweet, and so I felt uncomfortable even broaching the subject of extras.
We had a nice chat, and so she opened up to me. It seemed that she was not the sort of girl who would enjoy doing extras, so I didn't even raise the issue.
However, her massage was superb - elbows'n'everything.  Highly recommended if a massage is all you are after, and possibly if you are brave enough to broach the subject of extras with her. Since this was not a sexual service, I offer unto thee, meine kameraden, ze following:


Name: Cassie
date: 11 September, 2013
age: 23
figure: slim, taught and terrific. Unshaven.
from: MLC
service: massage so so, 50/h, 50 upfront tip (got her naked), 20 extra for HJ
contact: A:1/19 Belmore Road, Burwood; P:02-9747-8688; E:19bemore@gmail.com
works: didn't ask

Second time here. Cassie has a fantastic slim and taught body. I came in and she started a perfunctory massage. Nowhere near as good as Nellie. I had tipped her 50 upfront, hoping that would get naked + HJ, but it just got naked. Had her naked, and I massaged her. She complemented me. Guess doing a Blatchford gets them to like you. But not enough to get her to ask for extra 20 for HJ. Indeed, when I asked for HJ, she said that she does not normally do that. Anyway, I got to kiss and fondle a nice trim early 20s body, and I did get her to make me come with a little inexperienced HJ. What she lacked in skills, her looks did for me, so anchors away and thar she blows.

A tad expensive, but that's what you get for a hottie.

This is a double review, the second of two double reviews reporting on my visits to 1/19 Belmore Road.
Name: Sarah
date: 15 September, 2013
age: early 20s
figure: nice young girl, marginally attractive
from: MLC
service and price: bugger all: $30/half-hour
contact: A:1/19 Belmore Road, Burwood; P:02-9747-8688; E:19bemore@gmail.com
works: didn't ask

Came in with a booking. Chose a name I did not know: Sarah. Major mistake.
Firstly, her massage skills were non-existent. Just a bit of week pressing in places that got boring and no feeling.
When I started touching her, she said I'd need to tip, so I stopped.
I then asked about extras, and she said she did not want to do extras, but said she'd get another girl. I said I would pay the next girl separately, so after 10 minutes with Sarah I wrote off the remainder of this punt. Which led to Annie...

Name: Annie
date: 15 September, 2013
age: 23 she says
figure: friendly and attractive face, hot and tight little body; unshaven (perhaps trimmed?)
from: Taiwan
service and price: bugger all: $30/half-hour + $50 for naked and HJ (negotiated down from $70).
contact: A:1/19 Belmore Road, Burwood; P:02-9747-8688; E:19bemore@gmail.com
works: Monday-Saturday, occasionally comes in on Sunday

Annie is a gem. She knew that Sarah had asked her in to perform extras, and so she came in and asked me straight away what I would like. We negotiated down to $50 for naked and HJ, including that I could kiss her body   She came back from dealing with the money and we spoke about what I'd like. Annie has shortish hair (with lots of styling product, I felt later). Says she has been in Aus 20 days, but her English is quite good, so perhaps there have been multiple visits. She is very friendly and smiling, and eager to please. I started kissing her nipples and getting my hands everywhere, squeezing her body, her butt-cheeks. She was very responsive. As part of my kissing and squeezing, I lifted her up onto the table (she is quite light). The moaning may well have been FOAM, but a wet pussy does not lie. This girl is very trim. Squeezing her butt was great. It is not small, but not fatty, although firm. And massaging between her legs, whether from behind or from the front (in between her legs and her genitals) seemed to give her pleasure.

She seemed to genuinely enjoy the experience, and gave in kind. For some reason, I was unable to come with her doing the HJ (this is my fault, not hers), so I ended up bringing myself to climax while touching and looking at her body. The conversation was great. She seems genuinely friendly and caring, and is a 'naughty' girl - I think she genuinely likes sex, and suggested that we could negotiate FS next time. In terms of service and looks, this is the première girl at this establishment, of the four I have seen.

BTW: I was in the first of the curtained rooms. The washbasin is grotty (dusty), no-one has cleaned it for weeks.

my experience/comments:

Although, from my last 'non-event' experience here, I was quite keen to give this joint another try, luckily I did.

Rocked up there just before 7:00pm, there was only the one girl available and that was Annie, a kind off cute face with short hair, and a lovely smile. She escorted to me one of the empty 'close to shaggy' rooms.

I opted for 30mins/$30, paid the money and was asked to remove my clothes including my underwear which was a good sign, I also mentioned that I just needed a 'quick' massage on my back and the rest on my front. She was ok with that, she left the room and came back in at the time I laid face down on the massage table. 


Started, the 'light pressed massage' on my neck and shoulders, and we started the normal ML introduction conversation. 'Where are you from, do you live near here...etc etc? Spoke quite well English, more topics of conversation came about with ease, she told me she was only in Australia for 10 days, (If I wanted to believe...)  was actually quite surprised on the high visibility of various Asian culture in Sydney,  my reply I could of think was 'Welcome To Sydney..! 

Just on the 10 minute mark, I was asked to turn over, she then posed the question if I wanted any extra's , I asked what was on offer, she replied a nude HJ and a blow job, I was allowed to touch her anywhere for a total of $70. I had a moment to think about, and then she mentioned $60, I then agreed.

She removed her clothing, not great size breasts but her nipples were firm and pointing. Nice all round sharp arse, bum cheeks were firm, nice feel, and must say a good looking trimmed snatch. 

After a few wipe downs on my penis and around my balls with 'wet cones', then of all a sudden my penis was in her mouth, slowly sucking my top of my dick and then licking all my shaft and my ball sacs. Then straight into the blowie and really had her sucking nicely and staring at me as she wanted me to really enjoy the experience. She did remind to be careful and not to cum in her mouth. this is always a challenge in these situationsbut stood firm. After a good 10 minutes BBBJ, she started to jerk me off, while my fingers was feeling her pussy (first from behind and then front), soon I felt her 'wetness' while still tossing me, she made the comment how I made her wet and how nice it was for her.

I asked her if she was interested in '69' but mentioned that it's only a 30 mins session, strange, but I jut let that go, I didn't have the time to stay longer as I needed to be somewhere. 

I blew my load and it went everywhere, got a fair bit on her 'tugging arm' which she commented if it has been a while since I had sex (as I blew out a fair bit..) anyway, gave her.. 'Yeah, it has been a while....' answer and she wiped me down with wet ones and I heard the mamasan mentioning in Mandarin that time was up. No hot towels which would have been nice, anyway, I grabbed the original towel that was on the massage table and gave me a proper wipe down.

I did ask the question if she does FS and she said 'I do no sex', but the other girls here do sex. I told her, it's a shame you don't do FS as I will enjoy it vey much. She mentioned again, 'I offer almost everything, except sex....'

As DR BOB mentioned in the previous post, a genuine delightful girl and wasn't afraid to show her enjoyment during the session. Next time will ask the question again for FS and will opt for 1 hour, hopefully, with more surprises.  I would recommend Annie...

Just the only downer was the state of these rooms, they smelled, didn't really looked clean and no 'support neck pillow to place your head down. Maybe a bit more cleanliness wouldn't go astray...I doubt it if the Mamasan really cares...

Person's Name : Grace
Establishment : Burwood relaxation massage (formerly known as Chinese Relaxation Massage)- 1/19 Bellmore St, Burwood 

Date of Visit :  14/03/2014

Hours of Business : 7 days, 10:00am to 08:00pm

Rates :	$35/30Minutes

Age :   Early Twenties

Size/shape :   looked slim, (couldn't tell exactly with the outfit she was wearing) approx around 165cm, 

Nationality or Ethnicity:  Taiwanese

Services Provided : Massage only

Value for money/recommend?  For the massage, I guess so..

my experience/comments:

I thought why not go for a quick punt prior in meeting up with friends for dinner at a BBQ Chinese eat in at Burwood. I targeted this particular establishment as it was not far from the restaurant, besides I  haven't been back since December of last year, was hoping there could be some new talent.

I arrived in Burwood, fortunately was able to find parking nearby, walked to the location and first thing I noticed there was a neon light sign on the 1st floor window with the words Burwood Relaxation massage. I walked upstairs and walked to the main reception office where there was a middle age Anglo man sitting down on the office desk and a youngish Asian girl who ask me if I wanted a massage Yes I said, so she escorted me away for the main office, she picked up a clean towel from the laundry room and led me to one of the back cubicles.

Now during all this time, I had an suspicion this joint is now under new management, the previous mamasan was not around, change of trading name as per the neon sign at the front, and noticed the joint looked and smelled cleaner from my last visit.

Grace does not have a sexy face, although, she has some cute features. I couldn't get a good glimpse on her body shape as she was wearing a one piece outfit that covered from her top down to her thighs, also wearing a pair of black sports pants that covered her legs.

I opted for a half hour session, paid her $35 and was asked to remove my clothes and to lay down, Grace left the room an after a couple of minutes she returned. No towel on my back, she started to apply the 'No Name' Baby Oil on my back and the massage commenced.

Grace's understanding and speaking English was poor, one these situations where I needed to speak slowly, only been in Australia for 8 months she tells me. Even though she was not fluent in English, she was making the effort in trying to follow our conversations, also had a sense of humour which was surprising.

The massage was actually quite efficient, reasonable pressing on my neck and shoulders and working away down to my lower back and thighs. Soon after I noticed the time had reached around the 15-20 minute mark and I asked Grace if she offers any extras, a quick reply came with a 'no, not me.. 'Only one girl does extras, she not works today....'

I then asked her if she can finish me off with head massage, she asked me to turn over, she then placed the towel on my front proceeded with the head massage. Time was up, she went out to grab a warm towel and wiped my back and down to my legs. We said our goodbyes respectively and was out of this joint as quick you can say boo... 

If you asked if I was devasted, probably not, if you ask if I was hoping she would say yes to extra's of course, it's a bit of let down if you were expecting a sure thing to happen, not this time..

IMO, I can't see this joint lasting long if they are going down the path of an half baked legit operation. Why have only one ML that provides extras is beyond me, or maybe Grace has a bad feeling about me and would rather just play it safe, who knows. Would have been nice seeing her tugging me off, but was quite content to save my load and cash for another time and place.

Anyway, had a great after which was satisfying, really handy eatins on Burwood wood, reasonable prices as well. 


Hey Mods  this may warrant an establishment name change on this current thread.

Popped in this joint in the afternoon to see what was on offer. My last visit here was back in March and no extras was on the table with the particular ML. I have received 2nd hand intel there as been a change of owner here recently with a variety of girls to select. Well, I didn't get any action as the Mamasan explained to me there was only one girl working today and she will be available in 30minutes. That was surprising with just the one ML on deck today, I guess weekend business is not as strong during the weekday, The Mamasan did offer her self for a 30 minutes session, but only massage. She mentioned if I wanted 'anything more' I needed to wait until the only working ML was free.    

I declined the wait, if the Mamasan was willing to go that extra mile, I would have stayed. Wasn't really interested just to get a massage, so I thanked her for her time and exited down the stairs to continue my journey...

Best to answer upfront that you are here for more than a massage and the Mamasan should take care of it, unless there are no ML's available at the time. However, she did tell there are three girls available on a weekday and the roster usually changes regular during Monday  Friday.

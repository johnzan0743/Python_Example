Guess this is my very first review. ^ ^
I frequent to this massage place in Drummoyne.

Ph number : 0404 463 577
Nice Beauty 
198 Lyons Road, Drummoyne NSW 2047

This is not one of usual r-n-t place as it's basically run by a lady who is fully qualified and does give really good massage.
[Word of warning! If you are not used to this type of massage ask her to go easy as after a session you will feel like you've just run half kilo marathon.]
*
The place is strictly massage only with no hanky panky and she means it.
Of coz that doesn't mean nothing is going to happen.
*
Over the course of numerous visit we got to know each other better and during one of the session she starts to rub her groin against my leg and then my hands.
As to reply the pleasure I start to touch and then finger her on top of cloth and on next visit I pull down her leggings and explored while she was giving me a very good massage.
Also on that session she let me touch her breast and after the session allow me to fondle and suck her big juicy nipples. She's very sensitive with her nipples and clit. ^ ^
*
We never go beyond petting though. Usual session would be like first she gives me real massage while I lay on my front - and touch and explore her with one or two fingers inserted.
She sometimes bends over so I can insert full length of my fingers and explore deeper.
After that I turn over and she gives me the proper massage while I continue to explore, usually her pants and g-string pulled to her knee for easy access.
Once usual massage is done then she will turn her attention to my balls. I keep my balls shaved on her request and she loves to fondle and squeeze lightly my balls.
She even massage the shaft although she only does after she's completely soaking wet downstairs. So far she only licked and suck the head of shaft once after I had sampled her juice.
It was very hot day and after the session after pulled off her pant and g-string completely and her tops I lay her on the massage bed and went south. When I turn around to put my groin to her face she fist licked and then timidly suck the head till I exploded on her nipple. ^ ^
*
Her cost is $75 per hour and that's strictly for the massage.
And don't ask nor expect r-n-t as she will simply refuse to take the booking.
To be honest I'm not sure whether I'm the only one she's been offering the extraÂ…
*
By the way she's Chinese descendent Malaysian who's married to an old dude.
She's about mid-30 and have very fit body and friendly face and very warm/kind personality.

198 Lyons Road Drummoyne is "SAM's Ladies Hairdressing" which had several Males working inside...on the Wall out side is the Massage Sign which offers other Beauty Treatments that has the Mobile # 0404463577..I spoke to the Asian Lady who sounded quite nice and she charges $80 per hour but you must book....the only problem is that you have to walk inside the Hair & Beauty Saloon past SAM and I get the impression there are no extras ....................which I am too gutless to try and I didn't ask if she does HJ

She just rented out that room for massage and other beauty therapy. ^ ^
She won't do a thing till she knows and comfortable with you.
We clicked from the get go and she seems to enjoy the contact as much I do - it was her initiate the touching in the first place by rubbing her groin to my hand while I was face down. When I returned the favour by rubbing and pushing she gets soaking wet... She's also extra sensitive with her plumb juicy nipples.

How was it walking into SAM's Parlour and they and the Customers looking at you, I wonder it they know she's doing a bit more than straight massage and see you walk out an hour later with a smile.................

Does she let you strip down naked on the first visit or do you have that embarrassing thing of not knowing to take of the grundies or not??

Guys

Well today curiosity got the better of me and I visited Christine. Actually the walk through Sams wasn't that bad into the little room on the right at the back. Christine herself is a very friendly lady, a little older than 35 probably about 40+ and she actually says she has some Vietnamese in her genes. Anyway stripped off but told to keep the undies on...bad sign. Competent massage but honestly Selena in Chatswood does better and so does Natalie.
By the 50 min mark I decided as nothing was happening that I would up the pressure and see what happened. Anyway she let me rub her tits a little whilst she did the foot massage and laughed when I said "naughty feet" I also played a little with her leg but when I tried to push up into her groin area a polite hand pushed me away with "relax" damn thats what I am trying to do. Anyway suggested a HJ "No never touch it I am professional massage" was the reply.
Should I come back next week? Only if you want a professional massage, and by the way it will only cost you $70 as you are a regular...go figure. So there you go Searay I think not much action to be had here unless you want to invest large amounts of money and time.

Cost $80 and I took one for the team

I am not doubting Amuro this definately says YMMV

Agree, but 60 Evaliine St Campsie closed a long while ago.

Pretty sure 165 Canterbury Rd has been closed for years.

There a few other additional places in Campsie I could add if I knew how to do it.

Thanks Wotan, they are quite time consuming so I'm glad they are appreciated. I do them when I have a bit of time up my sleeve.

Thanks massageboy, if the mods mark it as closed I'll delete it.

I simply put on the map what is posted in the section. I'm not personally familiar with every area, so unless a place is noted as being closed in the thread title I include it.

Of course, that goes without saying, it would be a mammoth job to validate each and every entry; maybe we have some volunteers willing to do the gopher work for Charles????

Thanks MB that would be a great help, maybe PM Charles and ask. However I think if you could check the addresses, names, phones etc and Charles could handle the maps.

Yes, all that needs to happen is for someone who knows an area to let the mods know that a place is closed. They can then change the thread title to reflect that and I can remove it from the map. If you let me know as well, that will save me having to monitor for changes.  But I won't change anything until the mods do so first.

Sure, if someone lets us know or posts in the thread that a place is closed we will let you know. 

An FYI...when we get notification of a business closing that thread is moved to the  Retired/Closed/Disappeared Forum. It might be worth taking a look through there now.

Brillant Charles, good work........ in regard to the comments on the closed places, In using you MAP, I click into the review and if it is a good one and recent, that is my intel of the Establishment. Sometimes a RnT maybe closed for some time then another operator takes over the shop and sets up another RnT.
I would love to see your maps incorporate the Whore Houses say in BLUE

Thanks Searay, I was going to do the massage maps for the other states first, and then move onto brothels, but your suggestion is an interesting one as it would make it unnecessary to create a new map. I'll have to think about it. Perhaps the mods/admin could also indicate if they have a preference? Thanks for the suggestion!

My experience/comments : 

There are two massage shops near each other in this office complex opposite bankstown square. I had intended to try the previously reviewed shop at unit 7 but when I rang the bell a voice called out 'sorry busy now' so I thought what what the hey I'll toftt and strolled the extra 30m and into unit 3.

Was greeted by Rebecca a tiny friendly lady who was just finishing off a customer and asked me to wait in a spare massage room. A minute later in walks Rebecca and I say 'half hour'. Straight away Rebecca offers oral but I decline and say hj is enough for today. '$50' she says for half hour including happy ending so I hand over the money and get ready.

Rebecca knows what she is doing. Massage was medium strong but this lady is not really about the massage- after about 15 min the tackle tickle starts. Full reach under and verbal encouragement gets me ready and then 'turn over please'. She pulls her top up and jeans down so I can have a bit of a look - tidy body for her age with a cups. Lots of eye contact and nipple kissing get me over the line no trouble. This lady is experienced and knows how to please a man. 

Rebecca works Tuesday, Wednesday and Sunday. I could hear another lady massaging in the next room (thin walls) and what sounded like another woman on the phone out the back (boss maybe?). Place seems to have 3 massage rooms so this fits with the standard boss + 2 ladies set up. Worth a repeat visit to see Rebecca and whoever else is on offer.

Mods, could you move this thread if appropriate to the Therapeutic Massage Section? looks like I posted it in the bronze lounge by mistake.

An update to the review above. I went back to see Rebecca again and I'd say she is more in the 50s age bracket than late 40s. Also asked a few too many personal questions for my liking on the second visit which kind of puts me off a bit for return visits. Still the service was ok but as usual YMMV. Cheers.

Went here and saw Wendy yesterday.  Good massage .. took clothes off and gave a decent CBJ for $80 half hr. She was about 45 I'd say. Smallish boobs and a size 10 with a little bit of a tummy. Won't be back as I can get FS for the same price

I think this one is closed. Unit 3 in this complex has a for lease sign in the window and there was no signs of life about 45 minutes ago......

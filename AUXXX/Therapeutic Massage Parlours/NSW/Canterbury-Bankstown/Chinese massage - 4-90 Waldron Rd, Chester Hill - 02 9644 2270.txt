 Chinese massage - 4/90 Waldron Rd, Chester Hill - 02 9644 2270
				
Post Content: 
Well FMD if I haven't actually beaten SeaRay to a new Rnt joint out west.  He must be on holiday.  This place opened on Monday, and is owned by Lina who I reviewed in this section at Wellington Rd, Sefton.  Smart girl has been saving up and working in the biz for 2 years to learn the ropes.  She evidently is bringing a number of regulars with her, judging by the phone ringing off the hook on the first day!!!

Ex doctors surgery, so neat enough without being classy - carbon copy of every other chinese RnT - 3 rooms, massage table, speakers, table, lamp, fan.  Toilet out back is clean, shower is dodgy.

Lina is a slim chinese MILF, quite attractive IMHO.  Superb massage so even if you don;t go the whole hog, its worth the $50/60.  But HJ is available.  She's looking at putting on a few girls who are experienced, and she knows what to look for.  Don't expect FS here though, she'll be picking based on massage technique and doesn't want "any trouble" with FS problems.

Well worth a visit if you're out this way to see a lovely lady and get a great massage.

Well, I hurt my back yesterday - no, really, I did - so decided to nip out to see Lina.  She really does give a great massage, perhaps a little gentler than Ping, so she was the preferred option today.  Took the hour for $60, and she went to town on my lower back and glutes.  Suffice to say she actually sorted out my problem (lower disc number 3 was damaged years ago and can flare up) so I left there a very happy man, HJ included.

Business looked a bit quiet during the school hols, and she has another girl on each day, different girl every day.  She even made me a cup of green tea and we sat and chatted afterwards.  

So go on guys, if you're out that way give Lina a go - she's making an effort.

I can vouch for Lina's massage. Superb.

I thought I would check this place out on the way home from a game of golf.  I asked to have a shower first, as I was quite hot and sweaty. Shower was up the back of the shop with the toilet - cramped and uncomfortable to use (but certainly not the worst I have seen!). It's basically in a corridor through a doorway that leads to the toilet. Not in the open, but certainly not a 'shower room' - just an add on in the area directly outside the toilet where the basin is.

Shop is bright and clean (with dim lighting in massage rooms).  Reasonably professional set up. Certainly, a nicer fit out than other places I have been to. 

I would definitely recommend this place, especially Lina.  Very friendly and great massage skills. Best yet, really.  As for the HJ - I don't really remember that much, but was certainly nothing wrong with it.  Allowed touching of breasts over clothes.  Firm B+ cups.  $30 for 30 minutes, $20 HJ (she said "you decide" when I asked how much, so I offered the usual fare).

Oddly, she gave me a business card on the way out.  I'll definitely be back.

Been here a few times over the past couple of months. Saw Lina each time and agree with the comments above- very good massage and treats her customers well. One thing I have noticed about Lina so far is that if you ring and book she will set the time aside for you.

At many other shops the pursuit of the max profits means that on arrival you may be told that the customer before has extended, or be pressured to see another girl. Lina seems to understand that if a customer makes a booking chances are the customer only wants to see that girl that day. Its a rare thing at massage shops and I think something worth noting.

My experience/comments: Was running late for my 6pm booking so Lina suggested I take up the 45min massage session so that I don't cut into the time of her 7pm booking. Can tell from this she is very customer focused. She gives one damn professional Chinese massage, she really got the knots out of my muscles. Place is clean and tidy with 3 rooms. There a dodgy shower rigged up in the toilet but not recommended. At the end she asked "do you want hand relief" I agreed and after some tickle tackle she turned me over and worked her magic, at by that stage it was all a blur lol...

Tried this place on a Tuesday around 6.30 pm, end of June. The owner, presumably Lina, was busy and so another chinese woman 35ish was provided.
Pleasant manner and friendly but massage was light on and fairly brief. I think she was wanting to get away and I was the last customer for the day. HJ fairly routine but ok.
Price was 30/30 plus 20hj.
I don't think the place compares with Hope Street at Seven Hills

Person's Name :  Yoyo

Establishment :  4/90 Waldron Road Chester Hill

Date of Visit : 29/07/2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As above

Hours of Business :  9am - 7pm 7 days

Rates : $30 half / $50 hour

Age : Around 40

Size/shape :  Medium build Chinese Lady

Nationality or Ethnicity :  Chinese

Services Provided : Massage with happy ending

Value for money/recommend? :  Yes

My experience/comments : 

Went here today looking for Lina the boss lady who gives an excellent massage. However apparently Lina is on holidays in China at the moment. Yoyo greeted me and she looked friendly so I thought what the hey and took the half hour option.

Yoyo gave an above average medium massage, took the time to ask where I was sore. I indicated my shoulders so she paid extra attention to that area. Looks wise Yoyo is quite pretty milfish type neither thin nor overweight. I liked her relaxed personality which was just what I needed today. When time came for turn over she sort of asked with a raised eyebrow and I nodded yes so an unrushed two handed tug followed. I didn't ask about extras but Yoyo seemed ok with some light external touching. After the massage I tipped $20 which she seemed surprised to get.

All in all whilst its difficult to beat Lina's massage and overall service I'd say Yoyo is a decent alternative especially if Lina is not available. Just a word of warning though- I think that FS is not generally on offer here, its not that kind of shop.

went here today. The lady answered the door..man she was definitely not something you would wanna pay to see naked. Her name was Yobo or something she was old, she told me to go into a room. I thought maybe some other girl would come in. But no it was her, i kept my undies on, and she did an average massage and then asked me if I want a happy ending . I declined, appearing shocked that it was on offer. 

Stuff that. Won't go back.

I can still vouch for Lina's massage here- very good massage and tug. Lina is a nice lady who goes out of her way to make her customers feel comfortable. Was in there on the weekend and she really got the kinks out of my neck.

thought i'd give this place another shot. I really needed a massage and wanted to see what the fuss about Lina's massage was.

Called at 10:20am asked if I can book a massage with Lina..she said "who are you ", I introduced myself and said I heard you were good. She said come in at 10:30 it's no problem
I have a shower, then get there at 10:30...she comes up and says "you called for booking" I said yeah that was me, she then says "next time I massage you, this time take other girl she very good", the other girl was YoYo..I don't like to be touched by old ladies...i said seriously, she said "yeh next time i give you good massage i do for you"..i just turned my back and walked out.

Date of Visit : 26/04/2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :9644 2270

Hours of Business : 930am - 730pm 7 days

Rates : $30 20mins/$35 half / $50 hour

Age : ~ 40

Size/shape : Medium build Chinese Lady

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage with happy ending

Value for money/recommend? : No never

My experience/comments : 

Was in the area and having tried the two places in sefton and being disappointed by both I decided to try out what the adjacent suburb of Chester Hill had on offer, saw this place in the paper and on forums here and while the reviews don't seem favourable I decided to scope it out anyway.

Walked down the main strip and eventually reached a massage shop however there were a bunch of guys in hoodies just standing out the front so i kept on walking and hoping they won't be back once i come back around the block, however walking a few shops down i realised there was another massage shop and this was 4/90 so i quickly popped in. one of the ladies was occupied but popped out quickly and told me to wait for 5mins so i sat out at the front. Decided to go to the toilet and on the way out the other lady working there was coming out of the room and just looked me with an unfriendly look. anyway went back to the front and waited some more was so tempted to walk out as i was meant to be somewhere soon however just about as i was about to get up the 2nd lady called me into the room.

Her name is Jessica and she is rather unattractive and just has the average mature asian female body, i opted for the $30/20min option as i just wanted to get a quick massage a tug and leave and also i had a $50 note and it would just be easier. Anyway Jessica asked if i wanted hard massage and i replied medium. Anyway she started off weirdly with just one hand squeezing my back and stuff, then the 2nd part she did a proper massage but i have to say she is really strong... too strong i would say, not the good firm massage i like. was asked to turn over and asked if i wanted a hj which i replied yes.

surprisingly she was once gentle... at the start. she slowly rubbed my cock and balls in the palm of her hands then she started yanking that's where it got all bad. She just yanked as hard and fast as she could and it hurt about 1 min in so i told her to slow down something that i have never told a ML before... i eventually blew once she slowed down. anyway when she was cleaning me with the tissues she didn't even do it right and there was still cum on me so i had to ask for some to do it myself also at the end she started talking to me real close and her breath stunk.

I will not be coming to this place again, the other lady i saw when i first came in looked more decent and was friendly but not special for me to be drawn back. There are 2 other massage places here though, one a few doors down that seem more seedier and another one around the corner on priam st that i might consider exploring. Looks like my adventures to all these south-western massage shops haven't been so rewardning.

I haven't been back here for a while and I'm sad to see a few bad reviews as I like boss lady Lina. Might do a return visit and an update report. Disappointing to hear a customer got the old Bosses push to the available girl. I can understand why they want to do it but its not very good customer service if you've made a booking.

I finally made it back to this place on the weekend. Booked Lina for an hour massage and for me at least nothing has changed. Lina gives a very good massage, she persists and concentrates on the neck and shoulders and I always leave there feeling loose. We were talking about how shops run and she did say she honours bookings otherwise its on a turn by turn basis. Go figure.

There was another lady on but I didn't get to see her. I guess the only thing to remember is Lina is 40+ so don't go there expecting a young chick. But if you want a good massage first with an unrushed tug you can't go wrong. Cheers.

 Walked in yesterday lunchtime greeted by one lady who was busy and Mia was called out. Striped and received a reasonable massage. Mia is talkative and friendly. Laid face down first massage was ok she the right amount of oil not too much used a warm wet towel to clean off the oil the did some minor tackle tickle then turn over. She stripped and proceeded to give a good skilful hand job. I would recommend the massage and HJ as passable but there are other parlours in Chester Hill but all have the hit and miss factor. Massage 5/10, HJ 6/10, Looks 4/10.

Person's Name: Vicki

 Establishment : Chinese Remedial Massage 

 Date of Visit: 6 Jan 2016

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 4/90 Waldron Rd, Chester Hill 02 9644 2270

 Hours of Business: 10am - 7:30pm

 Rates: 35/30mins 

 Age: 25-35

 Size/shape: Slim to middling B Cup with Shotgun nipples

 Nationality or Ethnicity: Asian

 Services Provided: Professional chinese massage, Nude HJ with touching and sucking

 Value for money/recommend?: recommended

 My experience/comments: 

Early morning and running early for a client, so dropped into this establishment, quite prepared to turn tail and walk out if the it was full of dragons.

To my relief and already swelling member, I was greeted by a fresh faced young lady you immediately reminded me of Nicole" of QVB, similar facial features, (that was the end of the comparison).

Vicki talked me into a 30 min massage, Vicki was wearing a elastic tube dress with her blue bra poking out, so I sort of knew what was on the cards, she was also touchy/feely and took my arm and guided me to the 3/4 height walled room.  This room only has a curtain for a door, but it does have a hand basin in the room.

Anyway, as soon as I confirmed I was going to stay, she went off with my money and started the music playing, I clearly interpreted this as a way of giving us "aural privacy", if I had any doubts as to what she was going to offer me then, the music took those away,.

Anyway, she started with a great firm massage, and a lot of fun mischievous chatter, she teased, stroked and rubbed my back any other bits, giving a tackle tickle here and there.

at one point she reached under me and just gave the head of my dock a little rub to remind me of what was going to be shortly offered.

Anyway, flip time and she offer a HJ for $20 and nude for $40.  I took the nude option and she stripped off to reveal a nice and tidy body, B Cups and a shaved bush with a few days growth.

What next flowed was a great two handed HJ, with me sucking her hips and giving her clit a workout.  I did not get her to orgasm, but did at least make her weak at the knees and swoon a little.

She constantly looked me in the eyes and poked her tongue out, she looked to be having fun and enjoying herself, which ensured I enjoyed myself.

Vicki is a graduate nurse who makes more money doing cash massage work, than she would make as a nurse, she tells me she is doing this for two years.

She works here on Wednesdays, and In Bondi Junction and Sutherland on other days, no idea where.

I am tempted to come back and se this girl again, and maybe again to see how this develops.

I was given a though hot towel rub down and a glass of water, this girl conveyed a serious customer service attitude, I was almost sorry to leave.

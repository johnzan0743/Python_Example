[COLOR=rgb(51, 51, 51)]My experience/comments : [/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]Needed a massage, hurt my back.  I drive past this place on the way to work every morning, so thought hmmm..it has neon signs (tick)...has a sign that says $60 whole body (tick). I googled review the place and some guy complained that the women were flirtatious (tick). I thought excellent.

Parked at the station car-park next to KFC walked across, push the door in and there are official documents saying "no sex services" and how it's against the law etc. I don't know it was too much reading for me. My massage therapist walks in.."you have booking" "Yes 1pm" she says "OK follow me".

Now i'm thinking this place is really small....payment made, and then asked for oil massage. Room is separated by curtain..damn. And place looks all clean and shit. Damn. Legit shop. Anyways she starts the massage and begins and has me covered the whole time. On the flip, she massaged my inner thighs..but then spent more time massaging my left leg more she smacked my balls...but since the towel was on top and my eyes were covered I didn't know what to make of it..maybe I was just out looking for clues and hoping extras were on offer.t. Anyways massage over and I'm out the door. 

not a bad place for a legit massage, however being Revesby and near the station you get so many people walking in for a massage..all guys too. So I suspect maybe something is up after awhile...who knows. I will try again in a few months as $60 and no health fund receipt is not worth it. [/COLOR]

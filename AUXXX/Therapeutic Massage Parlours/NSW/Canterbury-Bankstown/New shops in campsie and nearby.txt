 New shops in campsie and nearby
				
Post Content: 
Hi everyone.
Spied a new Thai shop "Beautifully Touch" (!) in 315 Beamish St Campsie just opened, and another one at 240 Moorefields Rd Beverly Hills.
Anyone been here and can share info? 315 has a big sign "One Hour Massage $49"! Seems a bit cheap, but I suppose you get what you pay for.

I went in from the lane , through the garage ,back door had neo open sign & into what seemed to be the kitchen dining area all pretty grubby Crash . I wasn't interested in seeing too much more of the place once I spotted the 2 old boilers ,maybe might have looked further I there was a young decent body to see but not these two . Always looking for an other adventure but has to be up to scratch .Cheers

In reference to the new Thai massage shop in Campsie, I mentioned in another thread it appears this is the sister shop of Cheerfully Touch Thai Massage in North Bexley. I actually walked past there last week and noticed close up there is definitely curtains separating the massage cubicles. Unless there has been a change of Management recently, I doubt it very much if extras will be a standard offering, just like their counterparts at North Bexley.

NEW Clinic @ 323 Beamish St Campsie # 0455931341 has started advertising "Care for Prostate, Impotence, Premature Ejaculation & Other Difficult Illness cases. Appointment required"
This could be fun, some of the best hand jobs I have been from Legit Doctors of T.C.M., you give them a story of the floppy cock syndrome and they try to make it better.

Two Chinese doctors there Searay, Wendy and Cindy, both know their stuff and Wendy fixed my ankle after I rolled it last year, she was previously a couple of doors down at the back of the hairdressers. Cindy also owns massage shop in Chatswood Westfield but as she says no funny business there haha.

 Wendy gives a good massage with an equally good ending. Claims she is a TCM Doctor but specialises in Wanking Western 
Woodys. 
She is cheap as chips and a well hidden wonder. As you say Sparksy Campsie has many new outfits mostly hidden gems.

It has been sometime since I saw Wendy so won't review her but perhaps someone else might. She probably comes under PML rather than this category.

For all you guys who are familiar with this location, this used to be a legit Thai Massage establishment managed by a Vietnamese syndicate. Going back a few years, I was a visitor to this joint, primarily the reason that I was gunning for a cute Thai ML who I eventually dated for a couple of months, interesting fling that was indeed.

Anyway, a few months back I noticed the joint was closed as informed by MB in different thread the business was relocated to another location.

Them I noticed slowly Asian workers carrying out renovation work and soon the familiar Chinese massage advertising signs that had contained pictures of good looking Chinese MLs appearing on the shop front window. Familiar signs you will see plastered on Chinese Rub and tug establishments.

I driving past earlier last Sunday I noticed the 'Open' sign was in vogue so decided to do a TOFFT late afternoon on the same day.

I rang the doorbell and a well spoken English Papassan opened the door and asked if there was any girls available. Yes was his answer was ushered to a private room which basically the opposite of the door entrance.

Again, for those who are familiar with this shop, on the left side there was previously a room that fitted as I remember 4 massage tables with curtains. Now this space was converted in a waiting room where I noticed there was an Asian looking girl sitting down,  I guess she was waiting for cliental.

 Next to this waiting room, there was another private room. Further up towards the reception desk, on the right had side where previously there were additional massage tables, it looked like a breakout area with furniture from where I guessed the owners hanged out.

In total, surprisingly, there were only the two private rooms, maybe not enough but time will tell.

So, in my allocated room, the Papassan gave me the run down with the prices and opted for the 45minutes session. Paid the dough and was asked to strip and my allocated ML 'would not be long'. I only manage to remove my headed hood sweater where I head knocks on the door and that same girls that was sitting in the waiting room was my allocated ML.

Her name was Mimi from chai ming in Thailand. Spoke reasonable English, long straight hair, as I mentioned little lanky for my liking but reasonable good looking and admittedly a charming personality. That was discovered when were discussing about our cultural backgrounds while I was undressing myself. 

The room itself was quite clean and tidy, had the heater going which field nice and she started to give me an above average remedial massage. From that point I realised the 'extras' question wouldn't be that far away, however, she asked if I wanted oil on my back and proceeded with a mediocre oil massage. 

Just after 10 minutes of massaging on my neck/back she moved down my lower back and bum area where it didn't took long for her to softly grabbing my shaft from underneath and giving me a ' would you like to be massaged there' Â…sweet, straight to the point, I like that. Asked what extras are available, and the options were as follows: $20 for a clothed HJ, $30 for a topless HJ and $50 for a nude HJ. Inquired if FS was on offer but quickly replied  ...'not at this shop. Decision time was upon me and not surprisingly I chose the $50 option. However, I was warned that she will leave her undies on as she has an issue with health and hygiene. Not what I wanted to hear, I mean the leaving on her undies part. I put on the BS explanation that I always maintain a clean and hygienic lifestyle and replied back telling me 'let's see what happens.

So I flipped around and she removed all her clothes except for her undies. She had perky A-B cuppers, however her nipples were totally dark as oppose to the colour pink. Strange it was but my objetive was to eventually remove her undies as this 'leave on undies' decree was already annoying me. 

She applied the oil on my shaft and started with soft rub on my half erected shaft, my balls and around my groin. She looked at me with a conniving smile while told her I want to suck her tits so she learned over, had a good gulp ful of her tits while she increased the tugging. Black nipples and all, I sucked on those sweet tits for a good 5 minutes before I asked her to move slightly back and slowly took down her undies. At first she hesitated by putting them back up but I insisted to see that pussy so I slowly again slid her panties down and saw a half shaven pussy and manage to press my index finger against her pussy lips while she kept tugging me. Then she slightly moved back when I lost my finger grip but I slightly pushed her in towards me so I could get another feel of her moist pussy.

Had her tugging me with the one hand with other massaging my balls that was turning me immensely. I couldn't hold back and blew my load gracefully, I told her to keep going until the last drop.

She took a deep breath and ask me how it was and replied back with satisfying...'that was good....'...

Provided me with a good tissue clean up then decent wipe with a warm wet towel. Had some tome left, so after she washed her hands she finished me off with an average head and neck massage. Time was up, got dressed and was on my way.

To be honest, was expecting a bit more in the part 2 department, but perhaps this particular ML had her limitations.

I was told closing time was 8:00pm daily, however, most probably if it is not a busy afternoon/early evening, and given the fact it is winter time, this shop may close early on various days.

Perhaps FS may be an option for a different ML, however, given the fact there are other FS options on the local area, will probably not rush back here in the immediate future.

Lastly, this shop has no phone line at the moment, was told by the Papassan their new contact number will be available in a week's time.

I'll keep this short as the last post didn't go through, excuse the format this was done on my phone. Was allocated Nicky paid my $30 for the half hour and walked into the room, cute Thai girl 23 years at most. Very typical Thai style oil massage, she happily obliged when I asked if it was OK to touch her during the massage. She asked me to turn over and started to finish off with a head massage. I felt compelled to ask about a happy ending but was met with a simple no. She said this was her first day on the job so I don't know if that played a part, but she was friendly and her massage was nice. So I may return, as previous punters seem to have had more success at extras.

A little quick update I was feeling a little bit edgy and the cold weather made me feel like dropping into to this establishment again to test my luck. Walked in and saw a cute young Thai girl and a shorter one that wasn't so cute on the way in, the papasan informed me that it was $30 for the massage. Upon enquiry he informed me that the shorter one would be attending my massage requirements, I informed him of my preference for the cuter,taller girl and he happily accommodated. Long story short, I was asked by the ML (May) to leave my underwear on and it was downhill from there I was given a Thai style massage with no oil and with a towel for the entirety of the massage, quite disappointing, I actually asked during the massage if she does a happy ending (multiple times to clarify) but I don't think she understood. So far that's 2 strikes at this place, on the way out I quietly asked the papasan if extras were on the table, but was met with a negative response. So I'm not sure if I'm they're playing dumb here or if the MLs that do provide extras are going rogue.

Establishment: Massage On Brighton

Date of Visit: 25/08/2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink 184 Brighton Street, Campsie

Hours of Business: 7 days a week 10am -8pm  

Rates: 30 mins/$35  45mins/$45  60mins/$55   

Age: around mid 20's

Size/shape: 8, looked like B cups,   approx 165cm tall

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai

Services Provided :  Massage Only

Value for money/recommend? : Good

I read with interest from the previous posts this joint might have gone legit, so I thought I would test the waters. Arrived just after 7:00pm and escorted in one of the massage rooms by the Chinese Papassan.

What I noticed right away the inside layout was different from my previous visit. The room adjacent the walkway was now the waiting room and the previous waiting room on the left was now dived into massage rooms.

As I had a suspicion this joint had altered its operations, I opted for only a 45 minute session, the Papassan was trying to convince me to go the 1 however, I really needed to be somewhere else within the hour so I stuck to my guns with the 45 minute arrangement.

I paid him the $45 amount and then was asked to remove my clothes and to leave my underwear on, that's when I predicted nothing more will eventuate than a 'clean-cut massage'.

I laid on my front and heard the knocks and entered Mee or Mea, I had a good look at her while I turned around during the introduction stage.

Cute face, short peroxide hair, wearing a white t-shirt and a pair of traditional Thai massage pants.

She wasn't really up for any conversation so I just accepted this will be a no go show massage session and at this stage was hoping I could of get at least half a decent Oil massage.

Much to my surprise, the massage was not bad at all, I mean I've  had worse legit massage in the past, she commenced with an acceptable pressure point Thai massage while the towel on my back. After 10 minutes, the towel was moved down to my waist and proceeded with a just as good oil massage covering my upper and lower back.

However, not even had my undies pulled down a bit so she could focus on my bum cheeks which was not what I was expecting. She moved on to my legs and made sure she would keep right away from the vicinity around my private parts. 

On the turn over, same deal while massaging my front legs, no hint what so ever of an accidental flicking of my ball sac, she kept right away from the area of indulgence.


Time was up, we said our thank you(s) and Good Bye(s) and that was it, at the same time I noticed she actually left the door unclosed.  Are these guys kidding? I mean, what did happen from the last time I visited, perhaps the owners got a warning with the Council douchebags and completely changed their business.

As long this joint remains legit, I will not be returning soon. As I mentioned, the massage was all ok, however, I have at least two 'no undies' legit massage establishments in Burwood that I attend with more than satisfactory services.   

How long this joint stay in business with this type of operations, I guess time will tell..

I noticed today that this place is now advertising on Syd99 so I am assuming there has been a change of direction towards RnT. I came very close to taking one for the team today but bailed out and had a legit massage with a lovely lady called Jane at Jessica's place in Ashfield. Maybe tomorrow but I have a hankering for Amy at 252B. Anyone else up for the challenge. Are you there, the Big M?

Actually MB, I also did notice this joint was advertised in the SYD99 website a few weeks back that triggered me for my last re-visit. Much to my disappointment at that time, I was unsuccessful in obtaining any form of extras. My punting opportunities these days have decreased for certain reasons and constraints, therefore just a bit tentative entering establishments that may or may not offer more than massages. But then again who knows, that's so called 'curiosity' that gets the better of me at times might just make me ponder if another visit is warranted....

Yes, similarly I have limited ability to have a 'proper' massage at the moment so I have been going to 295 in Ashfield to see the delightful Amy for FS and one or two highly trusted regular MLs. It will be a couple of months before I can really venture into new and untested ML waters. It is a surprise they advertise on an adult site and don't offer extras. What are they thinking?

It is one of those small half a dozen ads at the top of the page. I don't know if it has any permanent placement. I couldn't find it again the 2nd time I looked.

Had a ridiculous urge to pay another visit to the joint in order to satisfy my curiosity if extras were still on the menu. So, I phoned up earlier in the day to make a 7:00pm booking and the Papasan didn't bother to ask for my name or contact number which I thought it was strange at the time. Basically he mentioned a 'Ok' and ' will see you then..' which made me sceptical if this dude will honor my booking. 

I rocked up on time, entered the joint and behold the same Papasan was present and asked me ' Yes, you here for massage...' and I replied, 'yes, I am the 7:00pm booking..' Then he mentioned I needed to wait for 20mins and a girl will be available. Yup, been dicked by a douchebag Papasan, so I made it to clear to him if I needed to wait any longer than 7:20pm and he tentatively replied it was like more around 7:30ish.. so I thought should I give this guy my money or save it for another time at a different establishment. It didn't take long to take the later option and told him, thank you but no thanks and turned around and left.

Unless there will be a change of management, I will not going back for the life of me, as the local punter crowd will know there are better options on Campsie where you can get a cheap and nasty sure thing rather than pondering if I will get lucky in receiving extras from this particular operation.  Good luck to all who chooses to persist with this joint.

This place has started advertising wider range of extras than usual so it cuaght my eye..i have been here once before bu the experience wasnt very good

when i got there i was ushered to the front room...i saw a coupe of young girls walking around.....then an older one walked into my room so i was a little disappointed

but i comforted myself in the knowledge that older girls usually do a bit more

i asked fror a soft massage and she was pretty good at that

when she added some generous cat bath on the back of my neck and on my ass and back of my thighs as well i knew it was going to be a good massage

on the turnover.. the soft massage continued and she worked her body into all sorts of positions to rub various bits of her on me (mostly clothed)

i appreciate this teasing and so i orderd some nude extras which did not disappoint

so it seems this shop offers the same campsie massage as elsewhere !

Hours of Business : 10am-8pm

Rates : $55/60mins

Age : 35

Size/shape : size 10, D or DD breasts

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage, nude HJ, spanish

Value for money/recommend? : so-so. I wouldn't return for her as the massage and build-up was not very good. The extras were though!

My experience/comments : I had been walking around Burwood and not found any young or busty ML's available so headed to campsie. I've been here twice before, one of the rooms is pretty grubby but the girls are usually quite open to being cheeky.

Walked in and 2 older guys were chatting on the couch in the corridor, guessing maybe the papasan, though there was a young girl who was actually running the show.

Sugar was the only one of two available. She was in a tight black dress that pushed up her massive boobs. Fortunately got the room with carpet (much nicer than the cold and dirty tiled room). She had a firm massage but unfortunately it was mostly prodding. She only stuck with an area for about 20 seconds before moving to another body part. This means she went over my body about 6 times with her hands, mostly just prodding. She did not use much oil, but I find that to be quite good as alot of the cheap oil asian parlours use doesn't come off without a good shower at home anyway.

She asked me to flip while nude and she started on my front. As she came around to my side I complimented her on how big her breasts were and she asked if I wanted extras. Paid $50 for the nude and HJ, and had to tip before clothes came off. While sitting on the edge of the bed I got to suck on her huge and amazingly soft breasts. Seriously, they were amazing while she teased my cock with a HJ. She upsold me for another $20 for spanish. On her back on the table and had some fun and finished between her tits - she already had a tissue waiting to protect her neck from any excess.

The extras were good, but the massage and teasing before she took her clothes off was poor. 
WIR - no as I find a reasonable massage and tease important if it's a 1 hour session

Value for money/recommend? : Not bad

My experience/comments : 

Sign outside says Thai massage but shop has a chinese boss so looks like the shop has recently had a change of ownership. Couldn't place Jenny's facial features which was not a surprise as she has mixed heritage. The girls here wear pick uniforms which is a nice touch. I initially booked a half hour and on turn over asked for nude HJ, but on seeing Jenny's tidy bod I extended to 45 min and agreed to an upgrade in services. Asking price was a little high for Campsie but I managed to get this down to $80 so be aware if visiting (nude HJ was the usual $50).

Room I had was large and fully enclosed so not a bad setup. Probably worth a visit as the girls seem reasonable but as I said a little pricey for Campsie. However not so pricey when compared to Sydney as a whole. Jenny was friendly and seems to look after her customers, decent english and speaks chinese as well.

Cheers.

A new Asian RnT has just opened up in a newish small residential / commercial block at 121 Canterbury Road Canterbury (down and opp the RSL) that has 3 rooms with walls to the roof and doors that lock, standard fare is $60 per hour plus extras,
I had a young 26 Year old Chinese student who works Tue - Friday that had a freshly shaven beaver who must have been only a size 6 to -8 BUT she had the biggest longest Nipples I have ever seen on a young girl, you would swear that were MILF Nips but she has never been pregnant and they would be the size of my index finger to the first joint and would be easy 1" long, bloody amazing, she said they changed when she was 16 and they just grew & grew. For the usual extra, here clothes came off and although she was reluctant to let me grovel her pussy, once she had the SeaRay tongue licking the tip of her clit, she loved it (we will finish the review now)but for $100 I could have had F.S, DFK, BBJ, maybe some Anal and a good massage from"Jenny's Smorgasbord of Sexual Pleasure House" down the road at 267.
Now there is another new RnT at 200 Parramatta Rd just down from 208 we will have to check out..............

My experience/comments :

There's always a bit of a thrill in ToFTT at a relatively un or underreviewed place!

Let's start with the cons: It's a highly visible location right next to the Post, and with no back door. They keep the door locked so I had to stand there for a minute waiting, then to find out that the one masseuse on duty was busy. She did offer to let me wait inside, but I opted to come back later in the afternoon instead.  On return, still had to wait about 20 seconds, which can feel like an eternity on a busy road where your colleagues and friends might be driving by.
The rooms and tables are ok, but there was "the towel of doom" on the table, which looks like it gets changed once daily at best. I hate that. At least the fit-out is new so it felt clean-ish.
Other con is the pricing, which is a bit on the high side compared to options nearby at Campsie or Hurlstone Pk.
And no hot towels!  I was really looking forward to the hot towel on a chilly day like today, but alas, all I got was a tissue wipedown.

On the the pros:
Lisa was very cute and very nice. I'd say 35 y/o, pretty face, petite frame with what seemed to be very large breasts under a casual and well-covering sweater.  She didn't offer nude nor did I ask, so maybe next time although I usually only bother with that for the young MLs.
Her massage was quite firm and quite skilled. Not the best I've had, but certainly up there with some of the decent massages you can get. She was fast but thorough, covering the whole body in my 30 min session.
On the flip, she offered a HJ for $20 which was perfect. Nice brief tease then a skilled release. No FOAM but a big smile and seemed into it. Quick cleanup, hug, and out the door.

I'll go back and maybe try some of the other talent. Lisa is there Mon and Weds for those interested.

Is this Lisa the boss lady? Last time I was there were at least 2 others. I think better service up at 269 or in Campsie. 573 always a good punt too!

Based on her age, I thought she might be the owner and I asked her, but she said there was a boss.  Might have been skeleton crew because it was a Monday.

And, we're back!  A new fitout has opened at this location and it seems to be an improvement over the last, and hopefully will stay open more than a few weeks this time.  I suspect the mobile # in this thread title should be removed. I'll try and remember the number when I go by again.

Person's Name : May

Establishment : 121 Canterbury Road, Canterbury

Date of Visit : 1.11.16
Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 121 Canterbury Rd Canterbury NSW, didn't catch the phone #

Hours of Business : 10am till 7PM

Rates : $35/hh, $60hr

Age : about 28

Size/shape : chubby but cute

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

I was excited to see another neon light blinking on this strip of road and had to pop in and TOFTT.  I think it was literally their first day open, so hopefully I was the first of you lot to get in. 

Firstly, I was worried that this was a fully legit non-RnT shop by the signage. It was hard to tell. And when I saw the definitively Thai ML at the desk and saw the prices were $35 - $60, I was definitely on the fence as to whether any extras were on offer. My experience locally is that the Thai places in this price range are usually legit with no extras unless you're lucky, whereas the cheaper but usually non-Thai (Chinese) places are a green light for a tug. So this was a pleasant surprise, indeed.

The fitout was fresh with proper walls and doors, and a big printed "no sex" sign on the wall of my room. More alarm bells ringing.
At least the professional table had a new disposable cover on it, and I could see a small stack of them in the corner, so +1 for hygiene improvement over the last place at this premises.

May is very cute although a bit chubby, but with that typical Thai way of carrying it nicely. I could tell she had some tig 'ol bitties underneath her black tshirt, and looked cute in her tight black leggings. I'd say she's late 20's at most, but maybe 25. I didn't ask. Very bad English, so communication was a struggle at all points.

She started with washing my feet, then onto a toweled back and shoulder massage, which was great. Not the best, but skilled and more relaxing than therapeutic.  She then moved on to one of the best leg massages I've had. Great mix of medium pressure and flowing strokes, I really enjoyed it. At this point, there was no TT so I was pretty sure things were going to be left at just a massage.  

But as she finished up leg 1, the little brushes started and I started responding. By the time she'd finished my other leg, there was full on sack caressing and I knew we were off!

Flip over followed by a wonderful chest massage and lots of light brushing of my rock hard cock. She then leaned in and asked "Can I help you?" without a mention of any prices, to which I answered an enthusiastic Yes. What followed was an absolutely fantastic and skilled ending. She had a great mix of soft light brushing of the balls while she toyed around with different parts of my cock, working up to a firmly tugged and explosive ending. Really excellent. Big smiles all around, and it turns out she's not as innocent as her demeanour suggests!

Hot towel was cursory and too small, then a tip and out the door.  Now don't hate on me, but I gave her $40 tip because she went the extra mile and really gave me a great experience that was easily worth more than $75 all up for a 30 min massage. She also went over by about 10 min, so it was really 40 min anyway. Win win, and I will definitely go back.

On the way out I saw the other girl, who was cuter than May. Will have to try her sometime, too!  Treat these girls nicely!

I will spare a full review since I forgot to ask her name and the experience is not all that dissimilar from my trip here last week.
Key highlights: I missed getting the cute and stocky Thai ML's name, but she was cute and had braces on her teeth and was a 25 year old student.
She did a lovely Thai back massage that quickly devolved into some amazing long oily strokes over back and buttocks with lots of TT.  Didn't take long before I was on all fours and unloading. It was fantastic.

She didn't negotiate or even verbally offer the HJ, just went straight into it, probably picking up that I was after it.  I doubt there was more on offer, but I could be wrong. In either case, I think this place serves its purpose as a great RNT and I wouldn't push for extras just on principle.

All in all, both were great experiences with subtle differences but mainly similar.

Please visit this place to make sure that it stays open, gents!  And be nice to the girls. 2 for 2 have been absolutely lovely and I'm keen to try more.

Person's Name : May (but a different May to my last review)

Establishment : 121 Canterbury Road, Canterbury

Date of Visit : 7.12.16
Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 121 Canterbury Rd Canterbury NSW, didn't catch the phone #

Hours of Business : 10am till 7PM

Rates : $35/hh, $60hr

Age : 25ish

Size/shape : fit, athletic

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

It seems like the management has cracked down on extras. They have new, more aggressive signage that stipulates massage only, no sexual service, etc.  Was hoping it was just for show, but my ML seemed genuinely afraid to offer extras even though I made it clear that I was after some, and aimed for high prices presumably to justify the risk.

She gave an excellent Thai massage, actually. I would see her for 45 min or 1hr next time to give her time to shine. It was as good as a legit place, for sure.

Then after I directed her toward some TT, she motioned the HJ sign language along with five fingers meaning $50. I demurred that it was too much and countered with $20 since I wasn't looking to get her disrobed, just some standard post-massage relief.  She declined and went for the hot towels. After returning, she countered with $30 but I was pretty much over it by that point.  But she sat me up for the back massage which got me hard again, so I started serving myself. She then very quietly grabbed my little man and helped him to the finish, and I gave her $20 for chipping in, even though a bit late. 

I got the sense that she is under intense scrutiny from the bosses, but of course wants the extra $.  So tread carefully and if you do seek that little something extra, be discreet and don't get the girls in trouble!

Sadly, I think the fun is over here.  Last two visits have been met with very competent Thai massages with strict no-no for extras. There is new, enhanced signage on the wall about no sexual activity of any kind. Oh well, it was good for a minute!

Rates : $35/half, $50 nude & tug
Age : Said 27

Size/shape : C cup, Trim & terrific

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RnT, Daty, FS, Kissing

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

I was in the area and had half an hour to kill and tossed up between, 121 and 161, have never been to either and tossed a coin and won the jackpot...

Wendy let me in and led me to the room, place not particularly tidy and of course no showers....

Wendy speaks reasonable English, said she has been here for about 4 months, only works here Sunday. Gave her a $100 bill and stripped down as she went for the change. 
She comes back in and puts the change on the table and then squats down at the end of the table looking straight into my eyes as I lay there, she had that "please ask me for more" look but before a word was spoken we engaged in a passionate kiss....

Finally we parted & I asked how much for extra's, she only offered nude and tug for $50 but was happy to take all my change from the $100 note...I stood up and undressed her as we cuddled and kissed, before long I placed her onto the table and worked my way down for Daty. After her first orgasm I worked my way up for more kisses and cuddles as she gently caressed my fella.

She then said it was my turn and to lay back as she climbed on board with my cock against her fanny and she continued to gently rub me in simulated sex..I suggested it would be better inside her for both of us, she suggested $100, who was going to argue, I handed her another $100 bill and she handed me back my earlier change! Nice girl....

We fucked in every position, she came again at least once more before I was shagged and removed the condom as she gave me a superb HJ to completion...

During our time of deep lust I suggested I should take her home with me.....as we were dressing she reminded me not to forget to take her home....ahh what punting does to you...

She has a great firm body and clearly experienced in her trade but with that shy, cheeky look...the downside is the venue needs updating and showers would be great!!

Person's Name : Sugar

Establishment : 121 Canterbury Road, Canterbury

Date of Visit : 22/2/19

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 121 Canterbury Rd Canterbury NSW # 0404 454 412

Hours of Business : 10am till 7PM

Rates : $35/30 minutes

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : B cup, slim, unshaven

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, CBJ, FS

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

There was a bit of a back story to this visit. I was booked in to Amy at 161 and I got confused and went to this place instead. I asked for Amy but Sugar spoke no English and rang the boss who I assumed was Amy and she said she wouldn't be there for 45 minutes. I had limited time and was pissed that Amy hadn't turned up so I took the 30 minutes with Sugar as she was quite hot. While this was all happening, unbeknownst to me, Amy was messaging me furiously on Wechat to ask where I was. I didn't see the messages until much later. I quickly send my apologies to Amy but I don't think she believed me and was a bit rude. Can't blame her really but I don't think I will be trying to see her again.

Anyway, back to Sugar and 121. This shop is pretty run down. Paint peeling off the walls and generally decrepit. However, the 2 MLs on duty were both younger and sexy looking. Also on the plus side, the rooms are self-contained with full walls. Air-conditioning installed. Immediately after entering the room and agreeing to 30 minutes, Sugar asked if I wanted FS for $50. Is the Pope a Catholic? She wanted to give me a massage first and she did this fully clothed. She gave a surprisingly good massage but with no tackle tickle and she politely brushed away my hands when I tried to touch her. On turnover, she immediately stripped and sprayed herself with what I assume was some kind of lubricant. No DATY then! She jumped on to me and did a bit of a body slide and and moved to an excellent CBJ. I, very unusually, could have come from that alone. I asked her to stop and she moved on to cowgirl. I managed a few minutes and it was over.

After we finished, she continued massaging me in the nude and I was able to play with her breasts as she massaged my arms. A nice touch (pun intended).

Her service was perhaps a bit mechanical but at $85 for 30 minutes it was great value. She even refused to take the $10 tip I offered her at the end.

This shop seems to provide a reasonable and cheap alternative to the older MILFs plying their trade in the area and I will be back.

Pity about Amy!

Value for money/recommend? :   OK

My experience/comments : 

  After viewing latest reports in this establishment decided I would take a punt.   Rung up to check availability in 30mins and was told no problem.  I drovethere, and would suggest one should approach from the Canterbury Station end  if coming along Canterbury road. 
Rang the bell and was let in by a  young lady dressed in jeans and sweater, who greeted me pleasantly. This turned out to be the mamasan.  She led me into the second room on the left  and asked me how long, and then she asked if I wanted "everything"  for an additional $50. Seemed a "no-brainer" to me.  I would guess that either all the girls are up for this or only some are so she asked to be sure she picked the right girl.  So it seems FS is definitely on the menu here.

She took the money, I stripped off  and then a lady came in and introduced herself as Mula ( sounded like that).  She was wearing a short black dress, but as soon as the door was locked she took this and her underwear off.  She began  a massage which was OK, but obviously just intended as a precursor the the main event.  She began some light fingering and a bit of TT, before asking for the flip.

She began stroking junior and then motioned about a BJ, to which I replied in the affirmative, she then asked if I wanted it to be a BBBJ, I said yes, but she asked for $40  I offered 10 and she eventually settled for $20.  Covered BJ's do nothing for me, so I paid up, but probably shouldn't have.  The BJ was OK, took it to the full length , then hopped off  laid back on the table, put on the condom, and opened her legs for FS.  It did seem as if we were going through things by the numbers, and these days, that does not work for me, so we gave up after a few minutes, and went back to the BBBJ  and finally a hand job.

She had been nude all the way through and finished off with a bit more massage.  It was just about OK,  but lacked a bit of sparkle, but she is reasonably attractive and  would probably be good for most punters.  I'd be happy to go back and try another girl.  I'm not certain but Mula may only work here on Thursdays.

My experience/comments : 
Was in the area so dropped in. Someone had just smoked inside so the smoke smell was quite strong.
Offered 2 girls. 1 was overweight so took the skinnier girl and opted for just 30min with nude HJ. Mamasan said FS was available and you pay the shop a different price for FS. For hj and nude, you pay the girl the extras.

Had to get the manager to help translate what I wanted. Got her to go nude from the start but she just did a normal massage for the first 15min. No eroticism at all during the massage  got me to turn over and just went straight for the old fella when he was still soft. No teasing or slowly working up to it.

Receipts are available for health fund rebates here but I would take the risk given FS is freely available.

Could mods change the title to Q Cherry Massage? Very difficult to find the thread

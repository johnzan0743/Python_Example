Value for money/recommend ? Recommended for a straight massage. Don't expect anything else. great massage though and felt much better afterwards, it really eased the muscles, 

My experience: rubbed around the lower regions and I started to expect more, but then nothing. Still good and worth the money. Not sure if the price has increased since then as it was about 18 months ago.

Have to say that this establishment is a gem. The boss lady only gives permission for extras (hj) if she knows the client and they have been before and had this service. Everytime I go there which is about twice a year I try and see the boss lady. This saves time asking for the special and having to wait for the lady to return having sought permission from boss to do this. It is like you need a special dispensation from the Governor General to have a handy. But as this place does great massage as its primary purpose is to service the local asian community when a skip arrives you stand out but none the less are taken care of well enough.

These guys were spooked when there was talk of a crackdown by various authorities mostly local council sticking their nose in. Hence they stopped doing the tug and you can get it if they know you or you get the girl to obtain permission from the boss if she is there.
Other than that it depends upon the girl as to whether you get relieved at the end but a tip is always neccesary. Generally $20 should suffice!

Thanks to the forum information I went to Bali tonight and was allocated Fifi a lovely 30 something Chinese lady with a pretty face and a hot body. $50 for 60 mins of high class massage, well 40 mins and then 20 mins of fooling around. Fifi was a little worried about the boss, apparently she has a habit of surprise visits to check out the punters cocks!! Anyway sucked on those B cuppers for all I was worth , had a peek inside the leggins with a nice tidy snatch that Fifi would only let me rub, HARD on the outside of the pants. Anyway I came, she seemed to be enjoying it and all cleaned up and a bit of conversation, tipped her $20 and paid the boss $50 on the way out. Actually the boss has a twinkle in her eye so I might try her next time although Fifi was very accommodating and I suspect a couple of visits would open up the key to her panties.
Be discreet and I think you will be rewarded in this clean place with a quality massage.

Will I return, yes next week to see Fifi or the boss

enjoy

Went and say Lily the boss on Wednesday night. 1 hr of fantastic massage with about 20 mins of Chinese doctor rubbing around my cock and balls to promote strength. She wouldn't get me off but didn't mind me self servicing whilst she did a lovely ball massage....very nice. I asked several times if she would do the HJ but she said no she is a Chinese doctor and doesn't do that but I think it had more to do with it was the first time I have seen her and her husband was at reception. If you go Thursday may get her when no other family is around and after seeing her a couple of times I am sure you will be rewarded as she didn't mind me feeling her arse and rubbing her pussy through the leggins.$50 for 1 hr

Name: Baili's massage 
Masseuse May

Contact Details/Address: 13/15-21 Ninth Ave Campsie
Visit Today 11.30am

Prices: $50/hour

Age: About 26- 29

Size/shape: Slim & gorgeous

Services: Straight oil massage

I would recommend this place for a straight massage. My first visit here & a plain looking 40yo was going to massage me but she left me hanging near the front desk another girl came out & told me to sit & wait.
Not looking like a good start but after 2 mins 3 more girls came through the front door. One of them was Lily (Boss), May who could be her daughter (younger version of Lily) and another.

May came back & took me to the massage room which was clean & had walls all the way to the ceiling, nice change for a chinese joint. May gave me a really hard & thorough massage with plenty of oil & a towel covering my butt, I asked several times softer please, especially as she dug her elbows into my spine. Time to turn over & she placed a smaller towel over my cock but I said it was too hot for towels, she giggled. I mentioned I needed a groin massage now she looked confused, I put up 2 fingers indicating a tip, she said $20, I nodded. She slapped on more oil over my groin working my cock up to full height, I grabbed her left hand & placed it on my balls for some extra guidance. She let me rub her jeans on her butt but moved away when my hand wandered under her t-shirt.
Clean up time, overall a good massage nice hj with time more might be on offer.

On the above recommendations, I visited this place today, and saw fifi. in my opinion she is late 30's but friendly and pretty. She gave an absolutely outstanding massage, which had some cheeky rubbing in the sack area, but all very remedial. Then at the end, she offered a HJ for $20. I readily accepted, but unfortunately, her HJ technique is only average. She seemed worried about the boss, and may have squeezed my left nut too hard - twice , but that just delayed the inevitable....

Fifi says she works monday, tuesday, thursday and friday. The massage was 10/10 in my opinion, no wasting time on hands and BS, good hard back and leg massage.

Back again yesterday 29th to see the mamasan Lily as she does a fantastic massage. Arrived for my appointment at 4.30pm about 15 mins early and she was just finishing up. Anyway into the room and asked for 1 hr and told I could only have 30 mins WTF I phoned and told you what I wanted and we have started early, sorry I have another appointment. I was pissed off so I thought I am going to make you pay today Lily!!

Massage is excellent but I cannot work this lady out, always pushes her pussy into your hands when they are up on the table , lets you rub a bit but then pushes you away when you try for more. so I start the rubbing of her legs and pussy through her pants and she is not pushing away and seems to be enjoying it, although she would never let you think she is. She is starting to get me hard and I roll over and say I need some help with this and she says "times up" WTF no it isn't start rubbing this and get my cock hard. Lily starts to rub my balls and cock and then gets some oil to do the job properly. I am rubbing her all over and she is shrugging me off but never walking away out of reach whilst she tugs away, sort of the reluctant tugger type who is trying to pretend she is not enjoying her job but still looking sexy and providing a very sensual rub at the same time.

lily gets a little mobile stool and sits beside me giving me a very nice two handed tug and pointing my cock at herself she gets sprayed from me all over her clothes and floor and everything else that was in range as I blew buckets. This seemed to really piss her off as she had to go out to reception where her husband was with cum all over her shirt and pants, HeHe shouldn't have short changed my appointment time and she snapped you pay me extra $10.... no worries I would have given her $30 extra it was fuckin fantastic.

$30 for the massage and $10 for the HJ...now that is value from the mamasan who does one of the best massages in Sydney. She shooed me out the door quickly as I could tell she wasn't happy and after an hour or two I rang her on her mobile to apologize for the accident, she said no worries see you next week, YES you will.

Another fine Mamasan busting experience

Enjoy

Masseuse: Fifi for 15 mins, ??? for 30 mins

Contact Details/Address: 13/15-21 Ninth Ave Campsie

Prices: $30/30min, $40/45min, $50/60min

Age: late 30's?

Size/shape: Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Straight massage

Value for money/recommend ? Awesome massage but it seems I am having a bit of a strange roll with punts lately....

My experience: After some so-so to average massages in the last few weeks, I decided to give this place a go as the reviews had been awesome over the massages. My body had been aching quite a bit due to alcohol abuse over Xmas and New Year so i thought why not try a "legit" massage.

Popped in today (Thursday) at roughly 3:45pm-ish and was greeted by the dude at the counter. Was then itnroduced to a girl who led me into a room and asked me how long I wanted to stay. I would later find out this was Fifi that was mentioned in earlier posts. 
I opted for the 45 min massage and Fifi pointed to the sign that said 45 mins is $40. I pulled out my wallet to which she said "no, you pay the front later."
SHe left the room so I could get ready and I stripped down to my boxers (playing it safe) and lay down as Fifi entered the room and covered me with a towel.

As she massaged me, we had a bit of idle chit chat and talked about nothing in particular. Now if you have been reading my last few posts, you would have noticed that my last 2 experiences at  19/15-21 of the same building  (link)  and around the corner at  30/5-11 Sixth Ave  (link)  have been average at best. 
Well, Fifi was very friendly and i felt really comfortable and relaxed. We chatted as she gave me one of the best massages I have received in a while. She dug into my back and got most of the kinks out. I had to ask her a few times to go a bit softer, but apart from that the massage was near perfect.
She then made her way down to my legs where she asked me if i wanted to remove my boxers so it is easier to get to my calves. I said sure (thinking to myself this is a good sign) as she massaged my legs.

But alas, my bad luck of late strikes again as there was a knock on the door. It seems that someone had already booked Fifi for a massage! My perfect massage was interupted as Fifi apologized and explained someone else booked her and had to go. SOmeone else would be taking over the massage.
Not more than a few seconds later, another plumper lady walked in to continue the massage. But I dont know if i am just being negative or what, but it just didnt feel the same. I thought I had built up a a bit of chemistry with Fifi and was thoroughly enjoying myself when it was interrupted. The other lady who took over WAS doing a pretty good job, but I just wasnt into it anymore. What started as a chatty and relaxing massage turned into a silent mechanical massage (but still kinda good). 

To the other girl's defense, she DID do quite a good job and was quite nice, however the disruption just was too much for me and I couldnt get into it. At the end of the massage I wasnt offered anything else and I probably would have declined anyway. Apologies but i didnt catch her name. Had I have had the other girl from the beginning it may have been different but the changing really interrupted my flow. Especially as it was a good 15 mins into a 45 min massage.

On my way out as I was paying the dude at the counter i told him that while the massage was very good, i wasnt happy with the change midway through and it kinda ruined my experience there.

All in all, the MASSAGE was good and my BODY is feeling good and relaxed but my mind isnt. 

PRO: As mentioned above, go here a few times and it looks like you will get awesome service. I will be back to finish off what I started with Fifi. I am also curious to feel a Lily massage from the mamasan.

CONS: The change in girl really disrupted me. That's pretty much all i could find wrong with this experience.

Establishment and/or person's Name: Baili's Massage and Acupuncture - -

Masseuse: Fifi

Contact Details/Address: 13/15-21 Ninth Ave Campsie

Prices: $30/30min, $40/45min, $50/60min

Age: Mid 30's I am guessing

Size/shape: Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Massage with hand relief

Value for money/recommend?   For straight massage absolutely recommended! 

My experience: Well after last week's experience I thought i would play it safe and call ahead. I called up  on Friday afternoon and asked if Fifi was available today and made a booking. I arrived at the time of the booking and the dude at the front remembered me as the guy that changed halfway (see above) and I was led into a room with Fifi again.

Fifi remembered me from the other week as I stripped down to my boxers (playing it safe) again and lay on the table. I joked with her to be sure if there was no booking today as I didnt want to be interrupted again and she smiled and reassured me I had her all to myself this massage. Once again I was treated to one of the best massages I have ever received. Again, there were a few times I had to ask her to go a bit softer, but apart from that the massage was near perfect!
Throughout the massage, we would have a bit of idle chit chat and I found myself feeling pretty comfortable with her. However her English isnt the best every now and then there would be the odd awkward pause as things got lost in translation but overall we clicked and had a really nice conversation about nothing in particular. I felt really relaxed and let her know her massage was awesome as we just kinda chit chatted. I asked her what time they close and she said sometimes as late as 8 o'clock if busy. Hard working girl! We also talked about how last time she massaged me for 15 mins but then had to change as someone booked her and some other girl took over (which I found out her name is Judy). Although the other girl gave an good massage,  I told Fifi how the flow was interrupted and that her technique didnt continue on the flow Fifi had started. For a full review of the last massage just read the post above...

Halfway through the massage she started massaging my legs and once again asked if it was ok to remove my boxers, to which i said "ok." She then massaged my legs and buttocks very therapeutically with the odd "accidental" brush on my sack. So far the massage had been very relaxing and aboveboard, with slight brushes but not enough to suggest anything was on offer. When she finished massaging my legs she asked me to turn over. As I did, she covered my groin area with a towel (all proper) as she got some sort of cucumber cream (?) and sat down at the foot of the table and gave me a foot massage. I'm not a big fan of the foot massage as I am quite ticklish but this felt quite good. As she massaged my foot I heard a man's voice (customer) outside but i didnt really think too much of it. I didnt pay much attention as I was just relaxing from my massage. I heard the customer say "Ok, thanks" and leave. As they did one of the girls walked past the room and I heard the girls outside the room talking amongst themselves and laughing. Fifi overheard them and as she was at the foot of the massage table she opened the door slightly joined in the conversation as she and the girls enjoyed a good laugh  . Now my understanding of Mandarin is pretty much non-existant so I had no idea what the girls were laughing at. 

 I joked with her that she isnt laughing at me is she? She giggled as she said that they were laughing at the customer that just left. Fifi giggled as she explained to me in broken english that the customer came in but wasn't happy with the girls on offer and left. She must have seen the confused look on my face as she giggled and made the handjob motion "He only want hand-job!"  She giggled as I kinda nodded. I thought oh well, if i dont get a HJ at least I had an awesome massage!!

After the foot massage she wiped all the cream off my foot and as she she walked past I noticed her close the door. She then stood next to me and began to massage my stomach and chest as I looked up at her. Her touches turned into soft strokes on my chest and stomach which caused a slight swelling under the towel  

After a few more seconds of innocent rubbing on my chest she noticed the swelling and giggled. She continued on the soft stroking on my chest with a cheeky grin as the tent grew. She then leaned in closer to me and asked me "Ooh, what's that?" Another giggle and she asked if she could have a peek? Who am I to refuse her request as she removed the towel as my little friend stood up to full attention. She stood there admiring as she asked me if I wanted that massaged too? I nodded my head as she grabbed the oil. As she was massaging the last part of the body we agreed on  $20 tip.With business out of the way she continued on massaging the last tense part of my body. 

When we finished I lay back as she cleaned me up. I then joked with her that next time I come here I will book for 2 hours. 1 hour for the massage and 1 hour for a nap afterwards  . Lame i know, but it gave her a good laugh 

On the way out I noticed the old man at the front was gone and a lady was sitting there. I paid the lady at the front as Fifi introduced me to her as Lily the owner. I introduced myself and told her that Fifi's massage was awesome. I thanked Fifi again on my way out and left the premises feeling nice and relaxed.

Closing thoughts:
Now as mentioned earlier in the posts, I dont think this place is a rub n tug in the traditional sense. I think you have to go here a few times and be nice to the girls before they even consider it. Having said that, I dont think all the girls do it. I was respectful to Fifi from the beginning and we seemed to build a nice chemistry together. Now I am under no illusion that I am the only person she connected with or that she loves me, but I do know that I gave her the respect she deserved and in return i got it back from her. Even if i didnt get a tug this time I would most definitely have returned for the massage. As mentioned above, if you come in looking for a tug from the beginning you're gonna be disappointed. Build a relationship as a returning customer, then MAYBE it will happen. I got lucky and was able to build a nice customer/client relationship right from the beginning. If i wanted a tug i would have went around the corner to  19/15-21. But i was interested in a MASSAGE. The tug was a bonus.

I will most definitely return here for my massages.

Went to pay a visit to this joint last week hoping Rose will be working that day, however she wasn't but was to introduced to Fifi by the Boss dude (I assume Lily's husband). Well, I must say, FiFi is one cute MILF, probably late 30's, nice body and a cute face. We went to a room and asked me to take my clothes off while she remained in the room while I was undressing (gees, that was a nice feeling..). I layed down on the massage bed and she started with a firm massage on my lower back, hips and upper legs Then the ball trickling started to happen then more working around my groin region. She then shifted to my upper back on shoulders where she managed to ironout my knots in that region. 

After apprx 40 minutes of massaging, she asked me to turn over, I asked quietly for a HJ and she whispered $30, I said yes of course and she started to slowly to tug me with the other hand softly massaging my ball sac. After a good 5 minutes, she stated to tug me harder while the other hand still around my groind region. Feeling her arse from the outsaide  with my two obedient fingers was not a problem, even was able to pull one of her tit out and played with her nipple. She smiled at me and then climax was reached. She gave me a nice clean up with tissues and after followed with hot towels. 

Lastly she finished me off with a great head massage. All up, quiet satisfied, had 1 hour bliss with Fifi, maybe I just got lucky on the night.  Gave her the $30 and she mentioned will see you next week 
Paid the Boss man the $50 and was I on my way, it was a good one, no complaints.

Will probably go back and see her, maybe a few more visits will ask her if she can go nude, that will be a nice sight. Actually, if anyone looking for an even better firm massage from a tall Chinese young MILF, I recommend Rose. Although the few times I've seen her, never asked for any extras as she has 'legit' all written all over her face. But she will give you a great massage.

Rates : $50/hr

Age : around 40

Size/shape : solid

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage only

Value for money/recommend? : yes

My experience/comments : Dropped into this place looking for a remedial massage, and if it was offered a HJ. As it turns out Leena was a fair bit more homely than I would like, so I settled into what was an excellent hard remedial massage. Hands got nice and close to to the tackle, but no tickle. On turnover, I was modestly covered with a towel, but Leena massaged my upper thighs more than was strictly necessary . At that time it may have been appropriate to ask for a HJ, but I wasn't in the mood. Then she began bending my legs around and rotating them which resulted in the towel repeatedly falling off, at which time Leena caught an eyeful, which she took in her stride, and I found pretty amusing. So no HJ was offered, and I didn't ask for one, although I am pretty sure if I asked, I would have been able to get it. In conclusion, I would always go here for a good massage, and the occasional HJ. But never if I was after a HJ, I would go somewhere I was sure to get one...

Went to visit Rose, I went here a couple of weeks ago for a massage and decided to go again, didn't get the name of the first girl I saw. I just needed to iron out some kinks and read the reviews above. I called and asked if Fifi or Rose were working. I got the word that Rose was working but she was booked out for 3 hours straight. 

I got there and waited for about 20 minutes and Rose came out. She is nothing special, just your average looking chinese lady with short hair however reasonably tall.

Got asked to lay on the table face down and i laid there with nothing on and she covered me up with a towel. Her massage is firm, but really I don't see it any better than Yuki@Wattle St or Candy@QVB.  After about 45 minutes I got asked to turn over and I had my feet massaged, my arms. Nothing near the legs it was all legit.

It's good value for money for a massage, but like everyone says above if you want a little more you are probably better to avoid this place and go somewhere for a bit more stress relief

Hey Punters,
Has anyone been to this establishment recently (like the last two weeks) and received any extras?

My last three visits have been strictly massages only. Even from my last massage with FiFi (have had HJ's from her in the past) I was only massaged on my back, she didn't even asked me turn over to go over my front. Are these guys all of a sudden got totally legit? Or have their heard they are being monitored by the local council gestpaos ?

I didn't b other asking if a HJ was on the menu, just was thinking I would have probably got a 'no' for an answer. But no complaints, the massages are pretty good for the price you pay. Besides, there is always options B, C and D in down town Campsie.

But yeah, will be interesting to know if anyone lately has received more than a massage..

Cheers

It has been a couple of months since I last paid a visit at the joint, since I needed a reasonable massage with a reasonable price tag I thought I will give this place another try.

It was last Tuesday evening, without making a booking, I just walked in and there were two MLs waiting around, one of them was Fifi, and another mid 30's average looking Chinese looking MILF. As Fifi probably recognised me from my last non punt ordeal, she said, 'Hi. You like, massage..? 'Yes', I said and she escorted me to the last room at the back. She told me 'you no come here for a long time....' and I replied.  ''because last time I did not come here....' (Referring the last time as all I got from Fifi was a straight massage). I asked her I wanted to be massaged on my back and front and she said....'okay, I will look after you,' Sounded promising, so I opted for 1 hour massage.

I got undressed and she started to give me a remedial massage on my neck and shoulders for 10mins and then off with the towel and the baby oil was applied all over my back, hips and legs. Some finger flicking on my balls and penis while focusing around my bum. Then her fingers were sliding along my crack, which I commented, 'That is nice, more please....' she replied....'you like', and replied '...that what I just said....' so I was accommodated by more of the finger crack sliding procedure...

Then soon after, I was asked to turn over, applied baby oil on my front legs and she noticed my shaft went into errection mode. She asked the question if I wanted a massage on 'this..' , well of course I said yes and once again the brand name baby oil was in use again. Once my dick was all 'oiled up' she started a slow tug and I asked her if she can massage all around my ball sac. She obliged and her tugging become harder but her strokes were perfect.

But TBM needed extra to reach my climax, so I had my index finger pressing (outside) on her crouch, she didn't mind as she just gave me a nice smile, then my hand wandered inside her pants and before I knew it I was rubbing her arse and was able to press my finger slightly around her A-hole. I could feel something was brewing quickly down there so I lifted up her shirt, took out her left breast her bra and was sucking on that nipple like there was no tomorrow, nice nipple it was, lightly pink colour and looking so luscious.

I could not hold back, I hinted I was about to blow, she stepped back a bit with still one hand still tugging me, and then I blew my load with extremity! Damn that was good..!

She did a good job cleaning me with the 'no brand' tissues and then body wipe down with hot towels. We had 10minutes left so she asked if I would like to get my feet massaged, 'yeah', why not I said.

Now, since we got the serious business out of the way, she was asking questions about my Ethnic background, if I had a large family, why you are not married and if I wanted children. To me, just too many questions, but only answered how much she needed to know. 

But I asked her in return, about her personal predicament, she told me she is married with a 20 year old daughter. Hmm , I am not going there, I will let you guys ponder about that.. 

 So, massage was finished, got dressed and gave her $30 for the extras, she thanked me and insisted that I should only book her for a session, I asked for her mobile number and she obliged.

She gave me a sweet hug and I mentioned how much of an improvement it was from my last experience with her, she liked that.

 I paid the boss $50 and I was out of there, really satisfied punt session with the delightful FiFi.Oh Yeah..!

Yes, Fifi does work on Fridays. However, best to book in for a session prior to 7:00pm. It appears she has her long time Friday regulars booked well in advance from this timeslot. A month ago, I made a booking for Fifi on a Friday at 7:00pm for 90mins , I rocked up around that time and was asked to wait by the Boss dude (Lily's husband). I waited for 5mins and Fifi kind of explained to me there was a mistake at the time I rang up earlier,apparently she was already booked solid up to 9:00pm. So I was introduced to a younger ML ( can't recall her name..) and gave me a crappy massage and a pretty ordinary HJ.

Had my fingers so far in Fifi last week I thought I had lost my hand, offered more when I enquired with a but not at this shop though!! I think you would need to arrange and it would be expensive, I suppose if you want to cross it off the bucket list no problems.
Anyway lovely lady that does a great massage and according to the boss, enjoys every thing else!!

PS Lily the boss was very engaging on the Monday before Christmas, she must be starting to like me, even wore an easy access dress the first time I have seen her out of pants. She said "You are a very ....... boy" yep you don't know how ....... Lily.

Hey Sparksy, This might sound strange, but I was also there on Monday night and had an intense session with the ever delightful FIFI, I'm slowly beginning to realize she is one serious horny sexy Chinese MILF. I am trying to hold back if asking for FS as you rightly mentioned above, this will be a costly and tedious exercise (e.g. most probably you will need to book a motel..etc..) However, I did notice on Monday night the Boss(Lily) was wearing  like a long loose beige dress, she kind of looked hot, always wanting to book in a massage with her but the fact her husband is there at most days and thinking maybe extras may not be available at all times. 

if I can ask a question please, do you have any problem in asking or receiving extras from Lily? Or is there a particular day when her husband is not at the shop? Thanks

Good luck with Lily, she is a fiesty one. Being seeing her for a while and still no guarantee she will perform, I think it depends on how she feels on the day, like I said the reluctant tugger type. Also she has put up her price by $10 so my advice stick to Fifi who seems to enjoy her work.

Thanks for the advise, I won't deviate from FiFi as she does provide me a excellent service. However, I would still like to keep Lily on my radar, imagine a Lily and Fifi double session, that will be most interesting..

For those who had the pleasure being serviced by Fifi, she no longer works at this establishment. I was advised by another ML there she has now moved on and works at another Campsie  massage shop. To my recollection, there are three other Chinese massage shops that offers extras. Now she could of have gone to a legit massage joint, but I doubt as she is the kind that enjoys the extras with the added cash. Will need to investigate further. On my last session with Fifi at Baili's, she mentioned her working days was dropped down from 4 to 2 days due to the lack of customers. Perhaps time for Lily to come up with some  fresh business strategies to ensure her business stays afloat.

Person's Name : Cici

Establishment : Baili Massage & Accupuncture  13/15-21 Ninth Ave, Campsie

Date of Visit :  08/09/2014

Hours of Business : 7 days, 10:00am to 9:00pm    

Rates :	$50/60 minutes + extras

Age :   late 30's 

Size/shape : slim mish body, breast size C cups, size  8   

Nationality or Ethnicity:  Chinese

Services Provided : Massage +HJ

Value for money/recommend?  Yes

my experience/comments:

For a while I only been seeing Rose here as she give a excellent massage only service.

However, I have seen Cici for a few times now and am now warming up to me as I am getting some reward with every visit.

What I know Cicci has been work here for 34 months, a late 30's Chinese MILF, nothing sexy/erotic about her, however, a slim body with a perfect set of pointing C cuppers.

Actually Cici provides an excellent massage, definitely knows here stuff, she will provide you a firm massage and focuses on your troubled spots and has the good knack in easing out those annoying knots perfectly.

Her professionalism in providing such a great remedial massage tells me she was trained back in her homeland, perhaps one of these 'Chinese Doctors' they are not shy in exploring the needed muscles around the groin area.

Once you are flipped over, this is exactly what Cici excels in, really focusing in pressing certain areas under or around the groin while sexually stimulating when she without reluctance brushes your shaft and balls.

All it takes is to give her sneaky nod to giver her ammunition to strut her stuff. I like it when she caresses my stiff shaft, you can practically call it a 'hard dick remedial massage'. She will stay on this repertoire for a few minutes until she commences the slight tugging with one had and the other playing with my balls (I like that friggin' action...). 

Just on my second time with Cici, I was able to pull down her pants and undies just below here bum which gave my hand good access in playing with her butt hole and rubbing her pussy. However, I was surprised how bushy is down there, but had no troubles in find her pussy lips.

Before I could get a chunk of her breast I reached climax as struggling to hold it back, she kept on tugging me until the last drop then she slightly massaged my lower stomach with a puddle of my cum. Now that was surprising, this is going into Mimi @ Burwood territory.

I was given a detailed 'wet towel' clean all over my front and finished it off with a dry towel wipe.

Was asked to sit up and was a provided with a neck and shoulder massage that took it the finale of this awesome session.

I slipped her $30 for the extras which she was appreciative and kind of was trying to tell me to call her exclusively to make a booking with her again. Didn't really want to give my number to her so I explained that I will call the shop number to make a booking. Just my preference.

Pretty good value, if you in need of a very competent remedial massage and a damn good HJ, then I would recommend unreservedly.

What Cici was trying to explain to me she works every day except for Sunday..I think. However, she is definitely there on weekdays.

Think Big..

Establishment : Baili Massage & Accupuncture 13/15-21 Ninth Ave, Campsie

Date of Visit : Late September 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As above

Hours of Business :  7 days, 10:00am to 9:00pm 

Rates : $35/30min, $50/hour

Age : Late 30's

Size/shape : Average, bit chubby

Nationality or Ethnicity : Mainland Chinese

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : Yes for massage, but left wanting more

My experience/comments : 

Upon reading some of the positive reviews regarding Cici, I decided to test the waters and set foot in this massage shop. This is the 2nd time I've been to this shop, with the first time being a rather forgetful experience with a below average looking middle aged Chinese lady.

So I rang the shop, and booked Cici for an appointment. Upon entering the premises I did catch a glimpse of a plump young-ish ML with a decent rack (my style of ML), and the Papasan clarified that the ML in question was Eva (any intel here?)

Things didn't start too well, as she got a little defensive/paranoid when I asked if she provided extras(first time I've booked her), by bringing in one of her colleagues to ask how I knew her? But the situation cooled down, and she seemed to relax, when I explained that I was recommended her by my "friend" lol.

Her massage technique is actually quite good, and I was surprised that she had been only massaging for about half a year, she is definitely an avid learner of the massage technique.

Then came turn-over time, and she refused to give a HJ, this left me a little disappointed and left me wanting more. I understand that this may because I was not a familiar face and that it was my first session with her.

PS: I did make a return visit in hopes she would warm up to me, but alas she refused to again administer a HJ, while saying "sorry". I'm obviously not a regular at this shop, but I've had 3 visits and have been left wanting more each and every occasion. Hence, I'm a bit divided on what to do, the ML's here seem to provide a good massage, but the extras provided seem to be very inconsistent. With plenty of massage parlours at similar price ranges, giving out HJs more liberally, I'm left asking myself is this shop really worth it? (Maybe some of the experienced punters at this location can give me some words of advice).

Keep trying old son, what's the worst thing that can happen, you get a good massage which this shop is good at. Go around the corner for the rest if you leave unsatisfied.

There always seems to be people hanging around in reception also (friends of the Boss maybe?). I've poked my head in there twice recently but both times ladies have been busy. Do you have an appointment? they asked. Too much choice in the area to hang around and wait. Still it's on my to do list even if extras may be dubious.

Make an appointment with Amy, tell her a friend recommended her As he has seen her a few times, this is the truth she will look after you if you are nice, works Mon to Frid but you need to book at this shop as it is very popular with the Asian community both woman and men because they do a good massage. My relationship with Michael and Lily the owners has been built over a long time and they trust me as a cauc that they are probably usually suspicious of. This is my go to place for a proper massage

Tried that- Boss said on the phone they don't have an Amy that works at that shop. There is one that works at their other shop at Turella but only a couple of days a week. Instead just did a random walk in a couple of days later and got Rose. Nice lady very good massage but that was it. Got a surprise visit from the Boss lady about 3/4 of the way through the massage (checking up maybe?). I'm not sure but I think I understood some of their brief conversation - thought I heard the chinese words for first time and a colloquialism for HJ. I was on my best behaviour and turned on the charm but no dice.

I can't remember if you have written about 209 Beamish Slarty but they have a couple of ladies who do excellent massages and a variety of extras as well. It can be a bit hit and miss with a mixture of some very sexy and some pretty ugly MILFs. The weekend is probably the best time to go but Cici on Friday is good value. See my reviews of this place.

they are just giving you the runaround as they are very suspicious of any customer that they don't know well. As i did you just need to keep going and the rewards will come if you are after a great massage and ending. If not you want more etc just go around the corner where anything is on offer, and i mean anything

No mate don't do that. The issue is with Lily at the moment so don't go sticking your neck out. They probably think I'm some sort of chinese speaking council narc or something (which I'm not - just learned chinese to chat up chicks lol). I'll take my chances here or elsewhere no problem.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

I felt a little tense, so I thought I would get some much needed attention from this establishment. This was my first time with Michelle, and after messing up my booking with another lady(this problem seems to occur every now and then, makes me wonder if its purely accidental) I decided to try this lady. First impressions were not that great, she is not a looker by any means, and is on the skinny side. However, you don't come here for a attractive young ML, so I was not that disappointed. Michelle has a good massage technique, and I was thoroughly enjoying her firm pressure. Then comes the flip, I was getting visibly aroused, so I pointed at my dick with the universal hand signal to enquire about a possible HJ, at first she looked as though this was her first proposition about a HJ in her ML career, but I was not so easily convinced, so with some persuasion, she relented and gave me a rather satisfying HJ while I groped her arse.
What was funny was that she asked me whether this was common practice at this place, and looked rather surprised when I informed her that some of the girls (without naming names obviously) here provided HJ's.

The damages for the extras was $20, so for $70 total for the hour is definitely value for money IMHO.

Hours of Business : 7 days, 10:00am to 9:00pm 

Rates : $55/60min + extras (slight price increase..)

Age : Early 30's

Size/shape : lanky, tallish, C cups, size 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage plus HJ

Value for money/recommend? : just a pass mark for the whole experience


After a failed attempt at 184 Brighton Ave Massage, I was out on the prowl in downtown Campsie for a retrieve and for some weird reason I decided to give this joint a try as I have enjoyed competent massages from various ML's in the past.

So I rocked up and waited for a couple of minutes before a lanky Asian woman arrived at the desk and asked me if I made a booking. Kind like a baby face, not overly attractive but decent looking. I said no and asked if there is anyone available for a massage? She said 'yes..only with me, is that ok' ? Why not, so she directed me to an empty room was asked to undress and lay down.

Didn't wait for long until Angela walked and commenced proceedings. Pretty short introduction conversation as admittedly wasn't in the mood for a chat. But what I gathered thru her broken English, Angela was from Shanghai, been in Australia for a few years and only works here once a week. 

But straight to the point, her massage skills was just average, more like a guessing exercise in trying to identify my pressure points and then she commenced a halfhearted hand strokes down along my back. Also mentioned to focus on y lower back and bum and hips top test the waters if I would get any unexpected brushing under my groin area. Never eventuated, leg massaging was nothing to rave about and at this point I was keen just to flip over and ask the important HJ question.

Then it was time, I was on my back and the towel was placed beneath my lower stomach area, she started to rub near my groin areas where it didn't take long before my stiffy was visible.

She moved to the front of the massage table where she oiled me up a bit and was producing these awesome long stokes from the top of my chest down to my lower stomach region where finally I felt the tip of her fingers accidently brushing my shaft. 

That's the sign I needed to make the ' special' request,  she just looked at me and placed her fingers over her mouth and nodded, like yeah right, the other ML's are not aware what goes on here, hello !!

Anyway, towel was removed, oiled my shaft and she went for it, first rubbing my bloated penis head for a few minutes before she started giving the old shaft a good throbbing. Eventually her whole jerking movement ended up being too mechanically for my liking, had no issues in groping her arse but her tits was out of bounds. 

I eventually reached climax and kept tugging me to the end with the comment....'Ohh, you cum plenty'....then she gave me a tissue wipe and upon request, she went out and returned with a warm towel for the final cleansing job. While this process was going on, she had the need for conversation in asking me stuff like , what is my background, where do I work and if I lived nearby in Campsie. Just too much information for my liking.. 

Got dressed, slipped a $20 which she was content with the amount. Then we walked out and paid her the $55 in full at the front desk and then was off my merry way.

Noticed a couple of ML's here which I haven't seen previously, perhaps Lily (Mamasan) has done more ML recruiting, perhaps these new crop of ML's are tuggers in the hope it will sharpen the business as it was in its heyday a few years back.

That was my night in the Hood, of course, I doubt it if it will be my last..

TBM 


BTW - I have a couple of massages from Wendy here in the past (that's right H_T, Wendy from 191 Burwood Rd...) if I remember, she works here Mondays and Fridays. However, that roster may have changed recently if her shifts have been altered at 191 due to the recent management change.

Person's Name : Bonnie

Establishment : Baili Massage & Accupuncture 13/15-21 Ninth Ave, Campsie

Date of Visit : Mid November 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As above

Hours of Business : 7 days, 10:00am to 9:00pm 

Rates : $40/30min, $55/hour (increased prices)

Age : Early 40's

Size/shape : Short and petite.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean

Services Provided : Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Average.

My experience/comments : 

Asked over the phone who was working, and was interested by the sound of a new lady by the name of Bonnie, so a booking was arranged for an hour and off I went. When I arrived, Bonnie looked like a pint sized Asian ML with glasses, who seemed a bit cold at first. The massage commenced, and I was rather surprised at how strong and therapeutic her massage was, I was a little worried with her petite size that she may not be able to exert enough pressure, but I was pleasantly surprised. It must be noted that although her massage was therapeutic, it wasn't quite sensual.

After putting me through some stretches that you usually see performed by thai ML's, I was asked to turn over. I thought I would just take the liberty to ask for a HJ, as this was my first time with this lady, and I didn't want any misunderstandings. Before the HJ commenced she even gave my penis and balls a therapeutic massage by pressing on pressure points, which almost hurt a little bit lol, but once she started pulling on my dick it was in a slow rhythm as requested, but her part 2 skills didn't seem as accomplished as her part 1. As she was pulling me off she would just stare into the wall, maybe wondering how she ended up pulling a strangers dick for an extra $20.

All in all, awesome massage, satisfactory HJ, not much sensuality though (although this was my first visit, perhaps she may warm up to further visits), but as this joint is almost exclusively chinese ladies, if you want to try a experienced Korean ML (she tells me 20 years experience), you should give her a go, I think I would prefer to stick with Cici at this place though.

My experience/comments : 
I was interested in trying Bonnie, but when  I called she was booked up for 2.5 hours and was told Cici would be available in 45mins time. I locked in Cici, haven't been here for a while. Though I really needed a massage to loosen up all the tight muscles.

The massage was very good, if you like a hard massage. At times i was in pain but afterwards most of the knots were gone. I've been here a few times but I think i only once had a HJ. I never asked Cici though laid face down nuded up and Cici came in popped a towel over my back as I requested no oil. Asked where I had aches and explained my lower back and hamstrings. She first worked on my shoulders, probably at least 20mins on my shoulders. She gives it a good hard massage but whilst giving me the massage her thighs get caught between my arm/shoulder and she seems to push her nether regions against my arm and shoulder. When standing in front to do my shoulders she drops her chest on the back of my head pretty firmly. 

Massage proceeds to lower back and when ever my arms is in vicinity she pushes against it, my hands brush her legs a quite a bit too. She then works on my legs. All this was taking some time, and I am thinking like other posts that maybe I'm not a regular so I'm not going to get anything extra. I do get asked to  flip over, then asked to see if she does anything extra she said no even if I tipped her, she said who have I seen before and I just remembered Rose (whom I reviewed a while a go). She then said time is near over. So I didn't push the point.

Then at the end of the massage she stretched out my hamstrings.  The towel was over the top but as she pulled my leg up she decided to have  a look at the smallish one. First the right leg then the left leg. 

I may try again. Cici is a MILF she looks OK but not a glam but her massage was impressive. May try her again. I did see Bonnie waiting for her client when walking in. Her looks are the same, just to let you know I think she is more Chinese than Korean she was speaking mandarin to the boss, then again could be bi lingual. who knows. Maybe worth seeing also.

Just to demonstrate how everyone's experiences are different with ML 's and its always YMMV, my experience with Bonnie could not have been more different to Bluey08 if we tried for part 2.
Unbelievably good massage, best I have had at Bali. Massaged, stretched, pulled and caressed every part of my body in an hour, worked hard and really earned her money.
Got to the end and she administered one of the finest ball massaged and cock worship sessions I have had any where in the world. It was so good I had to play with her tiny arse and rub her pussy and tits while she did it, only fair right. Maybe we clicked, maybe the other girls told her I have been a customer for 10 years, who knows but I will be back for Bonnie again next week. Lets see where it ends up, I have had a few interesting, bordering on obscene experiences at this place over the years, including with the mamasan Lily, where I once sprayed her walls while rubbing her pussy to completion haha.

Enjoy

If you read the earlier posts in this thread you will see I struck out a few times when I first started visiting this shop. However persistence pays and I am now an established customer. Regarding extras I still find it difficult when visiting one of the ladies for the first time. But I have a couple of regulars here where things are a bit different. Also the massages are generally very good quality.

My experience/comments :
I guess I'm chasing the buzz of seeing if I get rewarded for coming again, but I guess I am making the mistake of changing masseuse here. After seeing Cici, I tried Bonnie. I did see her last time waiting for her client and after the above reviews I tried my luck.

This place is quite busy and all ages come in young and old with their wives or ladies come here for a massage too. So those who do get the extras must really be regulars. I'm not doubting that.

Anyways the massage is more what I prefer, I think Cici's is much stronger if that is your thing. I just found Bonnie's more bearable, less me refraining from the yelps of pain. I did think I was going to get lucky this time, the time came to oil my back and Bonnie tended to rest her arms and hand on my arse. The massage was relaxing and the knots I had in my back were loosened up. Bonnie massaged my legs and there was no chance she was bumping in to the small one, she seemed careful how far up the groin to go. 

She wiped the oil down, and I was asked to flip around. She gives your upper thigh a good massage, stretches your hammy's the towel moves around and she gets an eye full of a semi hard small one. So here I'm thinking 50/50 chance. She then concentrates on the upper thigh more and she puts pressure on the groin region and I guess small one decided to shift right and she had to move it out of the way... and then after that it all ended. 

I don't really come here to expect much but like i say it's more the buzz if you get rewarded for persistence I think. I will give it another crack and see if I get lucky.

Went back for a long time missed special from Lily the Milfy owner of this fine establishment last week on Thursday. lily is now not there on Monday and Friday and as usual the joint was packed and I got the curtain room in the hall. It's fun playing with her tits and fingering her on the outside of her thin cotton pants while she tugs away to a slow massive conclusion while her husband Michael is on reception. I still blow the hardest from a Lily HJ she is a master, I would love to fuck her and one day I am just going to put it on her and see what she says haha.
She may throw me out lol

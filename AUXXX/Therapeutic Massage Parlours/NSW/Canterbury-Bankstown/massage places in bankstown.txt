hi matty, yes i have been to 7/1-5 jacob st. was invited there by a WL who i was a regular of in another place. and for $75 she gave me a bbbj and fs. i was not all that thrilled with the place and have not been there again or seen her again. i find better service with better facilities for less $$$.

I regularly go to 3/1-5 Jacob St.

Very good massage and FS is on offer. 
Massage: $30 1/2, $50 1hr
HJ: $20
FS: Between $40 - $70 extra depending on the lady. I don't know if they all provide FS.

Very clean establishment with 2 fully closed rooms. If you are after a good massage with the possibility of a HJ or even FS this is the place.

This is upstairs if it is the same place?
Went here a few months ago, got a reasonable massage and ended up getting FS from the ML for an extra $40.

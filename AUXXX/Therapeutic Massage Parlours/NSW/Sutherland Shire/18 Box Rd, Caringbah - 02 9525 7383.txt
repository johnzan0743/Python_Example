Banjo to base, Banjo to base come in base!
Go ahead Banjo we read you loud and clear.
Base, I have sighted a new target and we need to get some more intel on over.
Banjo, what details do yo have so far over.
Base from Banjo details as follows......
Name, Secrets of Sydney. Address, 18 Box Rd Caringbah. Phone.. 95257383 Website under construction.
From all accounts it seems that the targets are all you Caucasians of the mid twenties group.
I am guessing this may be similar to the Bellevue 5 star retreat. Upmarket.
Hours of operations seem a little confusing, though I am thinking Thursday to Sunday 1000 till late.
Receptionist on phone advised that prices are,
$150.00 for 30 minutes
$190.00 for 45 minutes
$220.00 for the hour.
OVER
Base to banjo are you going in for a closer look, over?
Banjo to base..... I have to gather some additional funds for this punt, I think it may be DANGEROUS...Over
Roger that Banjo, if we can get any of the other Auxxx team to go in we will advise........

Just to be a little different!!!!!!
Good Luck
Love Banjo

Well, they have a Facebook page that suggests they don't open until 6pm.

It is a legal brothel - looks like they finally got approved by Sutherland Council - after 2 years and a successful  appeal - DA10/0549 (Here's the plans)

Yes, it is now a legal brothel. Best time to visit would be after six in the evening. The place is located right in the middle of a very busy industrial area. Daytime parking is a nightmare and the place is quite obvious to all and sundry. Lots of tradies around. Hope to have a report on the place soon. I believe, as from their ads, that they are in the upper money bracket.

Stopped by here last night, wasn't too impressed with the line up.

The reception looks great - and the entire place has that brand new smell, but the girls where a let down. 

The first I saw had two full sleeve tattoos, and stud piercings on each shoulder. She charged $200 extra for FS and would have been very late 20's or mid 30s.  The second (Zoe) also had quite a few tatoos and would have been early 30's, and looked very much like Sarah Jessica Parker..... She would do BJ for $50 or deep throat for $100, but no FS and no touching or DATY - as she put it "she doesn't let men put fingers or their face down there, not because I'm a bitch or anything, just not what I do" which is fair enough and entirely her choice, just had a weird way of putting it.

After those two I walked, there was a third girl on who was due out in 5 minutes, but the punter extended so didn't get to meet her.

I will give this place another shot, but first impressions of it aren't great.

I've been in touch with this place just after they opened via their facebook page.  Wasn't too impressed with the communications from them, all very 2 word replies which gives me a 'we couldn't give a shit' impression.  Combined with what I reckon might be overpriced girls who are most likely not very service orientated (but just money orientated!), I wish them the very best of luck.  I think they might need it!  Particularly after the small fortune they have invested in getting approved and the renovations. It might make them a fortune closer to the CBD, but in the TP industrial area surrounded by very service orientated Asian brothels I'm not too sure.  Too many of these new places seem to have the 'open and they will come' type expectation. 

I'd love to be proved wrong and be able to write an awesome review of hot sex with a hot caucasian, but not sure I'd risk spending over $220 to find out!

Have to agree with tgr. Stopped by some weeks ago but was so unimpressed with the whole episode that I did not bother to report it here. Sorry fellow punters, I should have warned you before. The prices are simply outrageous and, I think, made up by the "girls" as they go along. The night I visited there were only two "ladies" available. Both would fit in well in the dark alleys of the Cross. Completely uninterested during introduction and both appeared as if they could use a good bath and a lesson in manners. Unless management decides to smarten up it's operation I'm afraid it will fail miserably. Pity because the place is quite presentable. All it needs is some classy ladies to adorn the place.

How big do you think it is mate?  Sophie at 64 is wanting to expand as you know to 8 rooms (and has approval), but if this place is big enough and already has approval she might be better waiting until they go under and she can lease/buy the premises ready to go, or better still, make an offer on a struggling business.....what do you reckon?

The premises are certainly better than 64. Looks like they spent quite a bit on fitting out. Would be right for a take over if they go under, which is quite likely due to current management (or lack of). I think what they need is a good business manager to take over and come up with a viable operating plan. Offering Caucasians in the shire, at a reasonable price, would be a certain sucess.

Person's Name : Claudia

Establishment : Secrets Of Sydney

Date of Visit : 21/4/14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 18 Box Rd Caringbah

Hours of Business : Unsure 

Rates : 220/hr

Age : Mid 20's

Size/shape : Blonde,slim with a small B cup chest

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian

Services Provided : Rnt / CBJ ($50) / FS ($200)

Value for money/recommend? : Still undecided.

My experience/comments : After stopping off at Studio Relax and Bellevue without luck I thought I would give this place a try.  Given the last time I was here I was less than impressed with the line up was expecting to strike out at 3 out of 3 places!  The strange thing about this place is the receptionists are always HOT!  I would have happily seen her but alas was shown to the room and told there was one girl on.  In walks Claudia and things started to look up, she was quite good looking - slim, blonde with blue eyes - just what I was in the mood for!

She takes me up to the room and first impressions is this place is quite big, at least 8 or 9 rooms that I could see.  The room itself is quite nice, soft carpet comfy table and good shower.  We go into the room and I start to get undressed when Claudia discusses extras.  She said it's $50 for CBJ and $200 for FS. At that stage I only had $90 on me so I told her that and she said that was ok.  Bit of a mistake there which I'll come back to later.  While I'm showering she bends over the table with her ass pointing to the mirror while chatting which gives a great view!

I lie down and she starts the massage.  Not the best unfortunately but again not the worst (she did make use of the hole in the middle of the table which was good.  This last for about 15 minutes and then she gets me to turn over.  On the flip she then climbs over my face and is in the reverse position which offered a nice view of her pussy (looked great) but I couldn't lick or even touch it.\

Then she starts with the CBJ.  This was a lot better than the massage.  Nice and slow proper BJ not a HJ while putting their mouth near the tip.  I would have (and should have) just had a CBJ to completion, but at $90 thought the FS was too good to pass up. We switch to FS and boy was she tight.  It was a bit awkward on the massage table but given how hot and tight she was didn't matter as it got me over the line in no time!

We then get up to shower at which point Claudia looks at the money I had left on the table (at her request before we starts).  She then asked where the rest was, I said you said ok to $90 but she had heard $190.  Not wanting to have any trouble (especially at an unknown place) I was then forced to put the rest on credit card (with surcharge!).  Had I known before starting I would have only gone for the CBJ, not the FS but now I know for next time.

All up was an expensive session, and scratched the itch I had yesterday.  I would try this place again and see if the girls have improved at all or if Claudia was a one off, but am still unsure if I would see Claudia again.

So was the $50 for CBJ / $200 for FS in addition to a base charge?  Or can you walk in and get a massage and CBJ for $50 all up?

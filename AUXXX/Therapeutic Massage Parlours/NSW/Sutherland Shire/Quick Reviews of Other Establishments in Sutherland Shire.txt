I've been to 10 president ave years ago - good looking korean bird, fairly poor massage, with lots of teasing then pretended she would not do HJ. took a few more $$, but it was done - highway robbery if you ask me. Since then I hear it has changed owners, but still with HJ for sure, service probably depends on the girl.

I've been to Engadine massage a few times. Nothing special but not a bad place here is a link to my review. I like the quick review of all the places in the shire i'm trying to visit all the massage establishments and private massage ladies in the shire area and put reviews up on this site.

Re East Parade, yes indeed there is Sutherland Relaxing Massage at 29 East Parade.
This is on the west side opposite the station and right at the bus stops.
There is a review elsewhere on these pages, but last weekend they had delicious Serena, Vicky and Cathy for your pleasure.
I saw a review of Serena somewhere (not on this site). Will try to find, or better still, write a new one!
Website is Sutherland Relaxing Massage 29 East Parade Sutherland 0410 666 828 and Phone 0410 666 828.

What's happened to all the regular reviews we used to get about the Sutherland Shire shops? Nearly 2 months gone by for some, but a lot longer for most.
Is everyone staying home, or do they just not write about their visits? Just wondering why it's all so quiet.

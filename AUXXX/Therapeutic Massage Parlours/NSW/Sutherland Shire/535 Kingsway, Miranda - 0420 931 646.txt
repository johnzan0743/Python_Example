This shop is out in the open, although does have ok parking on site at the rear.
It is next to an optomerist(?) with a real estate upstairs and a restaurant at the front on the Kingsway.
Pretty much your typical asian massage joint.

Three cubicles, all with a curtain and walls that don't hit the ceiling. You can hear the conversation in the next room, but most seem to forget this while they are in there.
No showers available, but the girls will wipe you down with a warm wet towel. Air con for the really hot days, and pretty clean all around. Small cubicles with just the table in each.

I have been seeing Jessica for a rub on pretty much a weekly basis for a while, plus a few others as I get the urge on other days. Jessica is mixed depending on her mood. She allows me dfk, daty and also lets me rub my cock around her wet pussy lips and just inside enough to make me cum, which I do all over her lips...lol Of course she tells me I am the only one... She works Tuesday and Friday.

Other options are plentiful as the girls come and go as I think it's not all that busy there. But luck of the draw I have had girls that have no idea how to even pull a cock with no technique to even get me over the line, to another that works Saturdays that offers me a natural fuck every time I see her.

It's $60 an hour, $35 half, $90 for 1&1/2. Extras usually run $20 for the handjob, and whatever you can get for the rest. I was paying Jessica an extra $40 for the extras, the Saturday girl was also offering herself for $40 on top.

So in summary - good clean place, some duds and some gems if you are prepared to have a go.

Guys,
I called in here last Thursday,was told the price of $30 1/2 hour + $20 for handjob.
Pretty good i thought,but the prices seem to be different for each review,anyway the place is pretty clean,into the room i go and negotiate my 1/2 hour.
I had Nancy,early to mid 30s,Chinese,not too bad,short but thin body,dressed trendy in the knee high boots!!!
The massage was ok,it ranged from hard to soft depending on the parts of my body she was working on,then after about 15 mins she started on the tackle tickle,she could see i was enjoying this,so she kept going with the tickling underneath,i even had lifted up off the bed a bit to give her some better access,she took the hint!! 
Was then asked to turn over,where she oiled the little fella up and slowly worked me over and got me over the line!!.I hinted at some extras but no luck.
All in all i thought it was pretty good for the price,one of the better ones in the Shire!!

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Level 1, 535 The Kingsway Miranda Miranda Massage Centre | Miranda Massage Centre

Hours of Business : 10am to 7.30pm

Rates : $60 for an hour

Age : 20's

Size/shape : Say an 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Adequate!

My experience/comments : In my usual way, I like to visit an establishment a few times before putting key stroke to computer.  I have started to frequent Jiale massage a little more often after becoming bored with some of my local haunts (for example at Sylvania).  Jiale is located about 100m north of Miranda Massage.  Over the past couple of months I have had loads of fun at Jiale - it is full of MILFS who seem to like to be pleasured and offer lots of extras - I will write a new review of this place soon - not recommended for the younger gent who may think their grandmother is younger and more attractive than the ML.  However I tried to get a massage at Jiale some weeks back but they were booked so I walked down to 535 The Kingsway which seems to now be called Miranda Massage.

Over the years I have occasionally visited 535 but the service was very haphazard and not recommended.  When I walked up the stairs this time, I noted new paint (a charming bright green which I may suggest would have been on special at Bunnings) and the mamasan was a polite, quite gorgeous Thai lady who would be around 30 years old.  Unfortunately she was waiting for an appointment and allocated me to Arna, a cute early 20's Thai girl who massaged me well and finished off with a nude RnT for an extra $50.  I was allowed to touch and explore somewhat, but nothing out of the ordinary - but certainly she was beautiful.  I had a similar experience with another Thai ML about a week after that - I think her name was Jordan or similar - it did start with a 'J'.  I would describe the experience the same as with Arna except she lay on the massage table with me at the end to perform the final act.

And yesterday I met with Leah who once again is Thai and lovely.  Spoke English well and a good conversationalist.  Her hair is very long, all the way down her back and as she massaged me it was quite erotic to feel it on my skin.  The massage was reasonable, much of it done with a towel and minimal oil.  It was certainly relaxing although I was looking forward to the turnover.  At the turnover, she asked if I would like the special massage which included being nude.  I agreed and when I said $50, she said $60 and said the massage is special.  So off goes the clothes and I must say Leah was great to look at - very similar to the other girls in shape and age.  Unfortunately Leah was not too keen on a lecherous older mans gropings and kept as far away from me as possible.  So although she provided a competent tug, nothing much else was provided.  So the special massage for an extra few dollars was not as special as I was hoping.

I will be back to Miranda Massage and hopefully the mamasan will be available and to see what some of the other ML's may be like.  By the way, the website is very generic and not representative of the rooms or girls.  The photo's are just taken from other sites.

Rates : $60 for an hour

Age : 40's?

Size/shape : 10?

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese 

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Seventh Heaven were all booked out and so I took the opportunity to sniff around Miranda for uncharted waters, for me of course. 

I saw this joint while driving around and found a parking spot almost right in front. I jumped upstairs and was greeted by Lisa. She gave me an 'I know you' look and smile as if I'd been there before. I hadn't. But I suppose enough punters had visited the place with a glint in the eye for us all to blend into a single horny devil. Or perhaps all non-Asians look alike to her. In any case, Lisa ushered me to a room that was well appointed and pleasant to be in. I promptly peeled off layers and waited for Lisa to return. 

There's always a sense of anticipation when breaking a new ML and this was no different here. By her accounts, Lisa has been a feature of this joint for quite some time and I can see why. Her massage is strong and better than adequate. She works those knots with dexterity and without inflicting too much pain. As I was new to her there was not too much tickle tackle but there was enough of a hint to know what could be on offer. 

Lisa likes a chat and is flirty and vivacious. She wears her hair long and is quite slim. She's fairly attractive despite not being a spring chicken. 

Upon the flip she offered a HE which I accepted with glee. Her tug was excellent and was accompanied by all the right noises and commentary. Lisa enjoys her work and let me tell ya, she is worth a visit. Apparently there are other newer and younger girls there and I will sniff them out too. 

Lisa works most days and will look after you. She cleans you up with 2 hot towels and will let you leave invigorated and more importantly with an empty sac. 

Happy Punting!

Establishment : Miranda Massage

Date of Visit : 3 July 2014 at about midday

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0470 462 696 www.massagemiranda.com.au (my above post has incorrect website)

Hours of Business : 10am to 7.30pm

Rates : $60 per hour

Age : About 30

Size/shape : Size 8, B Cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

Services Provided : Massage and Nude RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : I have a little more time on my hands at the moment and have spent some of this by visiting 3 RnT places in 3 days.  While great fun visiting a few places in so few days I think the next punt will have to involve a bit more to keep my interest up.  I headed to Miranda where on previous recent occasions there is typically a younger pretty ML.  Today was no exception.  I was greeted at reception by the usual lady (very attractive mid 30's whom I would love to be massaged by) and introduced to Cindy.  Paid $60 at reception for the hour.  Cindy was wearing a tight little classic short dress and was attractive to me.  This place is clean and friendly and unlike other places which can be cold until the heater is turned on in the room, this room was already beautifully warm.

Cindy provided an "interesting" massage (I asked for medium) which consisted of driving both her knuckles hard into my back in an up, down, side to side manner.  It was very painful but of course being the ever polite punter  when Cindy asked "how massage John?", I replied "lovely thank you Cindy".  I am so weak!  I think Cindy may have listened to an audio tape (probably not a tape I suppose but an MP3 player) entitled "Massage 101", hence has a bit of theory but no real practical application.  However there was also lots of nice touching and massaging my bum for some time and eventually a decent tackle tickle.

Onto my back and I agreed to Cindy's $50 for nude and HJ.  Why not?  She is quite cute, nicely shaven and hand sized breasts.  Cindy is all for cleanliness (good) and she wiped my hands with a damp towel, then some wet wipes and then some of that water free hand cleanser.  Cindy was happy for some touching and appeared to enjoy herself.  We had plenty of time and she provided a very slow pleasant tug before completion.

There's not much else to report and as far as a standard RnT it was fine.  The website as usual bears little resemblance to reality but on face value could appear "legit".

[COLOR=#333333][COLOR=#333333]Value for money/recommend?: Went to this place back in late June and I hadn't been there for at least 2 years. I was hoping against hope it had changed for the better but who was I kidding.

Look, dont get me wrong. The place has changed inside and they have updated and added a few walls here and there and moved reception into a different place. This time instead of there just being your massage girl greeting you and taking the money, there is an actual receptionist who looks kind of professional and neat.

She takes your money and gives change and then leads you into a small closed off room which was clean and tidy and walls covering floor to ceiling. They have really made this place private now.

After getting undressed, a pretty young thing enters the room in a short tight clingy dress. I perked up with interest.

Maybe I am expecting too much these days but it was a pretty mechanical affair. She was pretty and fit looking but there was just no chemistry. Actually, she didn't have that dirty sexiness which a girl needs in this business and to keep you going back for more.

She gave a pretty lame massage and after talking she was a student. I've noticed these students after just a quick buck and good luck to them but they don't offer anything interesting apart from being nice to look at. I mean, if I wanted just to look, there are plenty of porn sites on the net.

After a soft pointless back rub which felt annoying more than anything, she asked if I wanted a handjob for an extra $20. I should have said no and kept the $20 for a pizza. But I figured I had to see if she could arouse me. 

It was another cold, robotic affair. Lubes up and just starts pumping erratically. It was dismal. No ball play. No touching anywhere else. Her other hand was just leaning on the table in a bored fashion. I tried to get my hand up her skirt and and at least touch something to speed up proceedings but she was out of arms reach. I tried pulling her closer and she said touching would cost more and to disrobe even more and blah blah blah. Once they start to discuss terms and money mid stroke, it just deflates the mood in more ways than one.

I was over it and pretty well not even interested. I started to question whether I should be coming to these places as they are so hit and miss. I wont be back there for at least another 2 years.

I got over the line with extreme difficulty and it wasn't even enjoyable.

I think the problem with these asian joints is that so many girls come and go, that they can't get an established clientele and regular repeat customers as it is so much pot luck. And when you do find that gem, she is gone the next week.

Oh well, suppose that is the punt for you.

Hours of Business : 10am to 7.30pm

Rates : $60 for the hour

Age : mid 20's

Size/shape : About 5 ft tall and slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : HJ and paid $50 for what was thought to be a nude massage

Value for money/recommend? : No I hate to say

My experience/comments :  I had no work to attend to last week so to pass time I visited 3 massage places and today I am posting the reviews of these.  The other massages were pretty good and while I feel I have a large tolerance for exceptionally poor value for money and service, I didn't think there was any real value this time.  While I note some of the above reviews are not good, I have experienced some good times here.  The advantages of Miranda Massage are that the ML's are typically young and cute, the place is quite clean and good air-conditioning and it is located away from Westfields and a busy intersection (which is where Jiale Massage is located).  Also the mamasan is gorgeous and I have always wanted a massage from her!

When I arrived there was a moments delay as Annie was giving the mamasan a massage (wow what a thought!).  The mamasan mentioned to me that it was Annie's first day on the job which should have warned me about what was to come.  However Annie was very petite, wearing cut off jeans and quite young (well compared to me) so I went in for an hour without thinking this through.

The massage was fair, lots of simply coating oil on my skin (reminded me of Christmas and oiling up the pork roast for good crackling!).  Very repetitive strokes and Annie used the towel to hide my nakedness, just like a "proper" place.  There was nothing sensual or exciting about the massage and some of the legitimate massages I have had were more arousing.

The turnover occurred without the slightest hint of touching the good bits.  Annie once again used a towel to cover me.  After a little bit of further oiling, Annie asked if I wanted the "special" massage and on inquiry it was the usual $20 HJ or $50 "take off".  Stupidly, and knowing that Annie was not the sexiest ML in town, I agreed to nude (or what I thought would be nude).  She asked for the money upfront which was one of the rare times I have been asked for the extra's money by a ML.  So I gave her the money and she took off her t shirt and cutoff jeans to expose a wonderful body and I could almost put both hands right around her waist.  However there was no thought about taking the underwear off which consisted of a padded bra and very unsexy blue cotton undies.  She wasn't overly keen on the prowling hands and there was no way she was going to remove any more garments.  I guess this is why she asked for the money before the take-off (which was clearly just take off outer clothes).  I did however establish that she was certainly a female albeit feeling through those cotton undies!

The tug was just that - Annie was clearly bored, looked at the clock continually and didn't do anything to easily get me across the line.  So of course her attitude put me off and the more she tugged the less inclined I was to cum.  But eventually I did much to Annie's relief.  She must have thought the cum was toxic the way she mopped up as well.

So a very poor experience.  I know some of the more learned members here would have asked for money back or spoken to the mamasan but I simply left as soon as possible - and I will probably even return at some stage hoping for something better!

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :  After the poor performance by Annie last month (the above review) I wasn't sure whether I would be back for some time but it seems 35 days later I have changed my mind.  Actually last Wednesday I parked my car out front of Miranda Massage and walked up to Jiale Massage for a very pleasant hour.  On my return it was closing time at Miranda Massage and there were 3 delightful looking young Thai girls leaving along with what seemed a rather large rubbish bag of used tissues!  So I thought I would have another try here.  And I am glad I did.

I was greeted by Mia, Thai, shorter dark hair in the modern bob shape, small to medium size boobs, gorgeous smile and pretty face - I'm a sucker for this kind of look.  She also wore short black pants demonstrating her long slim legs and a small black blouse.  Mia's very chatty and an adequate grasp of English.  She has never been to Cronulla or to the beach in Sydney, said no boyfriend so quiet Valentines Day.  Other general idle chit chat which provided a good rapport between us.

It was a decent massage and while there was no tickle tackle experiences, I was aroused by the turnover time (actually I'm always aroused it seems!).  For $50 Mia stripped and revealed lovely boobs with small nipples, a pleasant looking pussy with a degree of hair and a cute bottom.  Mia started to stroke me and kept looking at my face with a brilliant smile.  I provided plenty of encouragement and when she slipped some fingers near my bottom I expressed delight.  Mia then had a evil smile on her face, grabbed some more oil and rapidly pushed a finger or so inside me.  I was away very quickly after that.  After washing her hands (thank the lord) Mia provided a head and face massage and I was out the door in about an hour.

As mentioned in previous posts, Miranda Massage, while on The Kingsway, is a little more private than its competitor about 100m west.  I do find the service haphazard and the girls are younger and generally less experienced.  On a hot day the air conditioning is great - perhaps even too cool.  Mia works only on Monday.

 My experience/comments 

On the back of another review I went here looking for a gilr named Yosi.  I managed to get a glimpse of her, nice body but bucky teeth.  Anyway she was busy.  I agreed with the boss to take on Katie who had a fun look about her in the intros.   Not a glamour, but ok looking and a nice firm, curvy little body.  Negotiated (I think it was) $30 for a HJ in panties and bra.  Sorry cant remember exactly the extra, may have been $40.  Turned out be 30 minutes of slow, teasing cock and ball massaging the best of which i have ever had. She had no problems in taking her time.  She had me 100% shuddering, almost convulsing at the end of it.  Been a while since that has happened.  Good on you Katie.   Geez im getting old.. she may have actually got the tits out.. I cant even remember and it was only 9 days ago!        

Would return, yes.  She only works Wednesdays.

Only downside, she offered bodyslide and then wanted extra.  Nice try Katie, I have been around for a while, no chance of that sorry.

My experience/comments : Yosi only works Weds . She is tall & slender A/B little puppies & shaved .She has the body of an 18 yr old but she would be late 20 .She lived in NZ for 7 yrs & has been here 1yr . Speaks good English . She wears a bit too much makeup for my normal likes but is still very attractive .She has a small silver belly ring .She starts with a towel covering you & does a lot of stretching & uses her knees & elbows getting into the tight knots .After 10 minutes a good firm oil massage starts & at moments gets quite sensual with the places she manages to rub .Around your sides & up your inner thighs around your groin doing a lot of brushing which really gets me turned on .Flip time is about 35 min which ends up nude for $50 .She wears hot short, shorts & she just does not  strip right away  but does lots of tackle play & takes off one bit of clothing every couple of minutes ,allowing boob play & nipple sucking .Once her pants are off she almost lays next to you allowing good access for pussy play, only outside though .I only lasted about 10 minutes before shooting over the 2 of us . A good wipe down of oil with paper first before 2 hot towels cleaned up the rest .With about 10 minutes to go she gets up with you & does a lot of thai style streches on the arms ,shoulders & legs .The first visit she got dressed BUT the second time remained nude which was almost a nude twister session . I started to bar up on this second session & she asked me if I wanted another HJ but unfortunately time was up & another customer was waiting .Got dressed  & she gave a good cuddle before leaving .Great value for the quality of service provided . Difinitely returning .
Cheers { this Yosi does not have buck teeth}

My experience/
I was at Miranda on Sunday arvo and was to see Mandy on Monday. I was getting horny thinking about the visit on Monday so I thought I may get a massage with HE. Checked the interweb to see what was around. 535 looked ok and was not far from my hotel.

Rolled up and it looked legit and was offering health fund rebate. Went upstairs ( usually a good sign that it is what I am looking for) and the older Chinese owner made a point of welcoming you loudly and happily. I was asked if I had been before and said no but my friend recommended your place and I will have a relaxing massage and will leave happy. It was the right thing to say. I was told I will leave very happy and relaxed and how long you want. One hour.

i was introduced to Goong and was escorted into the room. I removed all my gear and lay on he table. The Thai massage was very good and I was starting to feel that this was going to massage only. No problem. Massage as excellent and this is all part of the punt "experience". 

I was was asked to turn over and a small washer was placed over Mr Wang. The oil was then placed on my legs and the massage continued. I was talking to Goong and telling her how nice he massage was and I am feeling a lot more relaxed. After this the massage became softer and then softer again. The long strokes on my legs crept higher and higher and my sack was the exposed below the washer. 

Goong then lightly tickled the tackle as she whispers in my ear if I would like more. I asked what was available and it was HJ for $20 and extra $30 for nude. As I was only there to get a quick relief so I ask for HJ only. She was happy to oblige. Her technique was slow and sensual. As I was getting nearer I asked her to go quicker. She did and then bang, out comes a rather intense orgasm. Goong just froze as I had shot a load up to her elbow. 

When I had relaxed she just cleaned us up and then proceeded to give me a chest and head massage. I gave her the extra and she thanked me and bowed and I did the same. Another smile and I left.

not a bad place at all. The set up is clean as are the sheets and towels. You will not be disappointed with the establishment or the girls I had seen. Even the owner as not too bad for an older Chinese lady. Just a warning. I am over 50yo and my idea of not too bad has hazed over the years.

Person's Name : Yosi

Establishment : 535 Kingsway

Date of Visit : 13/5/2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business : 10am-7pm

Rates : $35 30mins plus extras

Age : 30

Size/shape : small and slim. 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : YMMV - Not for me

My experience/comments : I just dont have any luck at this place. I said I wouldnt go again but I lied. This time, it might be another year before I go back. The problem stems mainly from having no connection with the girls here. They are strictly focused on money and even though other places are too, you do find the odd gem who likes you and has that sexual chemistry with. Me and this place do not agree.

I walk in and am greeted by the mamasan/receptionist who happens to be around 30 and unbelievably stunning. What a lady. She is wearing a floral skirt and high heels and they show her shaped legs perfectly. She has a beautiful face, great smile and is very attractive. 

I start to liven up inside. She says the girls are busy but will be out in 5 minutes and takes me to their staff room and I sit down. This receptionist has such an aura about her that I ask if she does massages at all? No. Sorry she says. I just work the front desk. Course she does. No one that beautiful and sparkling would I thought to myself. She was lovely.

Anyway, Yosi then comes into staff room and washes her hands and greets me. She is tiny. Skinny in fact. These days I like girls, actually I like women with some junk in the trunk. She seemed friendly enough.

We enter room and I pay with a $50 and she gets me change.

Comes back, starts massage and we talk. From NZ, rah rah rah. Similar to Gboats convo. I think something has gone down in NZ, ie. relationship break up as she was pretty cagey when I asked why she left NZ. I asked if she turned the lights off when she left, but she didnt get it.

I have to say her massage is quite technical and it is good. She reaches underneath and touches the groin area and it is a different feel of massage than usual.

Things went downhill once the tug started though. First up, she started playing with my cock. It was semi hard. Then she asked if I wanted to a hand job. I was in two minds but she had me literally by the short and curlies. I should have said no as I really wasnt feeling any chemistry with her at all. Maybe the receptionist fucked me up, but Yosi just wasnt doing it for me.

I agreed for $20 and paid her. This is where it gets weird and shithouse. She applies oil and starts to tug. No real life in her. She was giving a lot of eye contact but it was making me uneasy. I was starting to not be horny anymore. I tried to touch her over her clothes. She moves away quickly and says that will cost extra. I was stuck between a rock and a hard place.

How much? an extra $15 to touch over her clothes. WTF? I thought to myself. Over her clothes? Or $50 naked. I knew now she was on a major up sell and even though I was born at night, I wasnt born last night. 

I had to pay the $15 as there was no way I was paying $50 as I knew deep down I wasnt going to blow with just her tiny fingers doing the work. I struggled though, let me tell you. I made sure I felt front of pussy the entire time to get some moneys worth, but I could tell she was just going through the motions and counting coins.

It was just a dull, lifeless cash grab with no emotions and once again, it has you questioning why you enter these places.

Actually, I will not go back. Ever.

There are too many better shops in The Shire that are upfront with the massage cost and not this kind of sexual extortion which quickly deflates the size of ones cock.

Person's Name : Kara

Establishment : 535 Kingsway

Date of Visit : 1/7/2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :

Hours of Business : 10am-7pm

Rates : $35 30mins plus $50 nude HJ

Age : 20's somewhere

Size/shape : size 10 great boobs, slim.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Excellent, for me

Kara is a very nice, service oriented youngish Thai girl. Her massage, is excellent, as she says she still works in a thai massage (Therapeutic) place in Burwood.

I only saw her for 30mins, but a full hour would be fantastic just for the massage. Firm and remedial, with back cracking and stretching too. Absolutely top notch in my opinion.

A light TT lead into turnover. Nude was offered, and I found it hard to refuse, with Kara stripping to release beautiful just C cuppers that fitted my hand perfectly. 

A long slow HJ as given which was excellent. Lots of varying techniques, with long slow cock stockes, corkscrewing, and ball play. The whole thing was administered with good eye contact and attitude, commenting she wanted to do it how I liked it. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the whole session, for me it was a near perfect RNT, a very firm almost remedial massage, and a HE that was unrushed and not shy. I know this may not be everyones perfect RNT, but it is my definition. I hope some of you guys enjoy it as much as I did, I will be back for sure.

Person's Name : Mini

Establishment : 535 Kingsway

Date of Visit : 17/7/2015 (friday)

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :

Hours of Business : 10am-7pm

Rates : $35 30mins plus $20 HJ

Age : 30ish just a guess though

Size/shape : size 10-12 a little frumpy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : OK

So after a great experience with Kara, I dropped in here again. As commented by others, the receptionist is lovely, friendly and service oriented, it makes me feel welcome.

I was given Mini, who, is not all that mini really. Her english is fine, and she was wearing a tight leopard print dress which has tacky RNT written all over it. Well not literally, but wouldn't that be a sight?

Mini gives a very good massage, as all previous experiences for me in this place, the girls seem to be mostly Thai, and good at massages. This keeps me coming back, because a good massage to me is 50% of the visit. A very good massage and lacklustre HJ is still not a waste of money to me, and this time, thats really what I got. 

During the massage, a good amount of tackle brushing led to a turnover where I declined the nude option, I must be getting older and wiser. But another thing I like about this place is that the MLs seem to take that in their stride, I hate it when they get sulky because you decline the nude. So Mini did an OK HJ, I say it was OK because she didn't rush it, but otherwise it was not that flash. To me, rushing the HJ is the cardinal sin, so almost any other problems, I can deal with 

So all in all, I left satisfied, I will return, but try to avoid Mini for greener pastures.

Size/shape : size 8 maybe? great boobs, slim. Wears braces on her teeth.

Value for money/recommend? : Excellent, for me

Just an update on Kara, last time experienced her massage, I resolved to go for an hour next time. It wasn't to be, but once again, her massage was so technically good, that I will make a special effort to get back for a full hour with Kara.

So as I reported before, a fantastic massage was given, but no real TT! Marks off! This meant that Kara was faced with a fairly sleepy appendage. When nude was offered, I declined to see her reaction, and she took it without any upset, which is great. Kara then proceeded to do a very nice unrushed HJ, slowly playing with it, rolling her thumb around the head etc, and generally taking her time which was fantastic. Kara was wearing a tight short dress, so I had easy access to her silky knickers, which I gleefully felt up until the inevitable eruption.

Another great experience, I will return, for a longer massage. Kara gleefully cracks your back, and commented that I should select room 3 which has the posts for back walking. If you are squeamish about this type of massage, maybe give her a miss or ask for softer - but I ask her for a hard massage.

Date of Visit : 8/7/2016 (friday)

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :

Hours of Business : 10am-7pm

Rates : $35 30mins, $50/45 plus $20 HJ, $50 NHJ

Age : 30's

Size/shape : size 8 maybe? has had one child she says, B cup boobs slight sagging. flat tummy, in good shape

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : reasonable/yes

Dropped in here after a long absence. Nowadays, I feel that if you want Thai, then go for a $60/30 place with full nude etc, because its good value. And I notice that this place seems to be 90% thai, so it seems like a poor value proposition for $85 same thing. But, the massage is invariably better. And most MLs here are cheerful to accept a non nude HJ so it brings the value back if you are after a better massage option.

Anyway, a massage was high on the priority list today, so in I went! And they have heated massage tables, nice touch in winter.

I was met at the door by lovely Nadia. Wearing a nice dress, looking pleasant. Nadia was friendly in a standard thai way, and when I asked for a hard massage (45min), I was treated to a very strong massage - not for the fain of heart, if in doubt don't ask for hard. Nadia has a very good traditional style, but is cheeky at the same time, and spent a lot of time working the upper thighs with incidental, and absolutely intentional tackle brushing. 

Another note about thai MLs, for some reason, in my experience, they are all cheeky, making incidental contact, but are absolutely no good at TT.. In that regard, I think the chinese ML is usually much better. But on turnover, they seem to be slower, and more attentive. I feel like I should run a training course... a blend of the two would be perfect!

Anyway, Nadia turned me over and revealed a very respectable body, lay with me and gave a very respectable HJ. I would say reasonable value, but I would continue to look at new fresh options rather than go out of my way to see Nadia. If you want a good hard massage, then Nadia is for you in this place - only works Fridays.

Value for money/recommend? : surprisingly good

My experience/

The usual with this place, and easy entry up stairs. You don't get a choice of MLs really, so when i saw Linda I thought here we go again... She is the type you don't really ask to strip. On the upside, Linda gave a very good remedial style massage that I would return for - most likely for an hour, because the 30min option really just meant 15mins of really good massage.
On turnover, she didn't sulk about no nude, and proceeded with a very competent and unrushed HJ, slow ball tickling, varied strokes and a satisfying conclusion. Would I return, absolutely if a good massage and basic HJ are required

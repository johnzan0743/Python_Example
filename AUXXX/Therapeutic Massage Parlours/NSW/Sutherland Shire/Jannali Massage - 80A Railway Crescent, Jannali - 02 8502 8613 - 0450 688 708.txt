Rates: 30 minutes $35. 45 minutes $50. 60 minutes $60

Age: Early-30s

Size/shape: 5’1”, 57kgs, mid-length black hair, brown eyes, dress size 10-12, quite curvy in a thick/cute way

Nationality or Ethnicity: Malaysian

Services Provided: Massage and hand-job

Value for money/recommend?: Yes/yes

My experience/comments: This place has just opened. I saw the obligatory sign out the front so ventured up the stairs.

Pretty standard (but clean) RnT set-up once inside. They do have a toilet but I’m not sure if they have shower facilities.

Cherie greeted me and showed me to a clean, long and thin room. The walls do not go up to the ceiling so you would be able to hear another punter in the next room beside you. Massage table was clean with disposable towels on top and there was also baby oil and tissues on the dresser - good sign.

Cherie’s medium massage was quite good and firm. 7/10. She did my back with a towel on, then oiled my back up and got to work. She stood directly at the head of the table so my hands were brushing up against her thighs. I didn't let me hands wander, but she didn't move away either - good sign.

I stayed draped, but she jumped up on the table to work my butt and legs, so her pussy was sitting directly on the back of my head. I turned my head to the left to look up her short Summer skirt and she giggled - good sign.

Removes the towel and whispers in my ear offering me a happy ending - does Pinocchio have wooden balls?

Paid the required $20 and Cherie definitely knows her way around a cock. Great little hand-job.

All in all it wasn't a bad experience. It’s nice to know there is now a decent RnT in Jannali whenever I’m in that neck of the woods.

Thanks as always for reading!

They have an ad in the local paper offering a free hair cut with the massage. 
Did you see where they would cut your hair?

Hi wachumba. Sorry I didn't mate. The room I was in was incredibly long and thin with two chairs, a dresser with a mirror, and the massage table. Come to think of it, they'll probably  just sit you down in front of the dresser mirror and cut your hair?

Person's Name: Monica

Establishment: Jannali Massage. 80A Railway Crescent, Jannali NSW 2226

Date of Visit: March 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 02 8502 8613 / 0450 688 708

Hours of Business: Open 7 days a week. 9:30am to 7:30pm

Rates: 30 minutes $35. 45 minutes $50. 60 minutes $60

Age: Mid-to-late 20s

Size/shape: 5'7", dress size 12 (quite thick in a sexy way), C-cup breasts, long black hair

Nationality or Ethnicity: Taiwanese

Services Provided: Massage and hand-job

Value for money/recommend?: No hand-job is worth $50/yes Monica provides an excellent massage

My experience/comments: Pretty standard but funny experience. Was in need of a massage and release so popped in here.

Greeted by the Mamasan, into the room, paid for an hour, told to strip, and that the girl will be in in a minute. Jumped on the table and didn't bother covering myself.

In comes Monica dressed in a Sailor Moon costume.

Her massage is firm but excellent (one of the best I've had in the standard RnTs scattered throughout Sydney).

Tackle tickle while on stomach, then flip over and asked for a hand-job. I agreed but she told me $50. Lol yeah right  no hand-job is worth $50. I tell her I only have $20 in my wallet (which was the truth) and that's all I can pay. She agreed then had a bit of an attitude while giving the hand-job (not in a mean-spirited way, but in a cute/funny way, like 'OMG I can't believe I'm pulling your dick for only $20'). All good.

Came, dressed, thanked Monica and the Mamasan, and left.

Monica told me she only works Wednesdays and is open to full-service.

Cheers for reading!

Person's Name: Linda

Establishment: Jannali Massage. 80A Railway Crescent, Jannali NSW 2226

Date of Visit: December 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 02 8502 8613 / 0450 688 708

Hours of Business: Open 7 days a week. 9:30am to 7:30pm

Rates: 30 minutes $35. 45 minutes $50. 60 minutes $60

Age: 35
Size/shape: 5'9", dress size 12  C-cup breasts, short wavy frizzy black hair

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided: Massage and FS


I have seen Linda a number of times and have managed to build some great rapport with her. I think she actually likes me.

I have gone away with me being massaged now and actually try this scene at all my punts. Fact is, I am not there to be massaged and I dont want to waste valuable minutes of hand waving on me when I could be doing more devious activities.

My motus operandi is now entering the room, disrobing, grabbing said girl, in this case, Linda and actually creating a scene like they're an actual girlfriend. Funnily enough it seems to work.

So, in walks Linda, she is happy to see me. Can't talk english for the life of her but I let that pass.She has her phone translator and we do what we can. The rest is body language. I hadn't seen her for months as I was out of the game for awhile but I told her I was in Melbourne working. Even the mamasan enquired on where have I been. Mamasan actually gave me a handy when it first opened as she had no staff. It wasn't much chop so neglected to review it as not to upset the start of her business.

Mamasan does not do this anymore. She does cut hair though if you stay an hour. I havent been game to get a cut as a wonky hairstyle would be a bit hard to explain to the missus. There is a chair set up in another room which the girls use to hang clothes and what not and also doubles as a hair salon. Love it.

Onto Linda. She only works Fridays and has the tightest pussy I have ever encountered on a ML. She is also hairy down there and I absolutely love it. Bring back the 80's bush I say. I pretty well will only have repeat visits with girls who are hairy so I would appreciate any input from my fellow punters.

YMMV with Linda. She needs numerous visits to open up and gain trust.

So, I just get Linda to take everything off bar her underwear which I do at a later stage. Being the festive season, nothing like unwrapping your favourite goods.

I get her on all fours on the massage table and have my way with her. Kissing her body, touching her, basically getting her turned on so when I peel off her panties, they are already showing signs of wetness. Gotta love it.

She likes kissing and I have had FS with her on a few occassions. Other times, I have just done the same set up with only fingering her while she lets me blow on her nice C cup tits with cigarette butt size nipples or on her bush.

I have got away with paying $40 for FS with plus $35 for mamasan but basicially give her $50 now as she is a great girl.

Can't really comment on her massage ability but I am sure it's pretty good to if that is what you're after.

Hours of Business: Open 7 days a week. 9:30am to 9:30pm

Value for money/recommend?: Yes/yes.

My experience/comments: Finished up a job in the area quite late and realised this place was still open.

Was greeted by Sandy and shown into a room.

Paid the $50 and stripped down in front of her while she stayed in the room.

Massage was decent and quite firm (even on the legs where most women often go a little softer).

No hint at anything extra until 10 minutes out from the finish.

Offered a hand-job. Informed Sandy I only had $10 cash (which was the truth). Sandy didn't mind and obliged, even nuded up with some touching.

Decent experience from a reliable Shire joint.

My experience/comments : This is a new shop opened a few weeks ago, and is very close to a Chinese RnT place. I thought I would TOFTT and see if more than just massage was on offer. It looks legit, but the location (not the most salubrious part of town, and proximity to the RnT shop) made me wonder if more than a massage might be on the cards.

There are just two rooms (with walls that don't reach the ceiling and sliding doors without locks - all bad signs of course) and a liitle cubby hole next to them where the ML's hide. I thought at first that the sole lady visible (in her early forties) would be giving the massage, but after I paid my money an absolutely delightful young twenty-something poked her head out from the cubby hole and smiled at me. 

The first lady took me into the room and told me to undress, but concluded with the unwanted words "keep underwear on". On hearing that (and seeing the setup of the room) I knew it would be unlikely that more than a massage would be offered, but you never know your luck.

I did as was told and laid down and the young lady came in and started the massage. She did my back first and pulled my underwear down far enough to enable massage of my buttocks. This was very good and renewed my hope for more. In fact I was quite enjoying the uncertainty and it was making me quite horny. After finishing with an excellent back and arm massage she moved to my legs (after first moving my underwear back up). I took the opportunity to say that I was very hot (which I was - the massage table was heated) and that the towell she had draped on my legs and now wanted to move to my back was unnecessary. She put it aside and I then asked if I could remove my underwear as well, but she said no. She then proceeded with an excellent massage of my legs and, when completed, asked me to turn over.

Having done so, I was finally able to see the sign on the back of the door, which stated plainly that only remedial and relaxation massage was available and no sexual services. So, nail in the coffin. With that made clear I settled back to enjoy the rest of a simply excellent massage. She had the knack of applying just the right amount of pressure exactly where it was required.

So, in summary, this is purely a legit place, but if you want an absolutely superb massage (and from a very attractive young woman) with no extras this is a good place to go. I'll be going back there for precisely that.

Establishment : Ton Hom Massage

Date of Visit : 28/05/14

Hours of Business : 9:30am to 7:30pm, 7 days

Rates : 70mins/$79

Services Provided : Massage only

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, for massage

Passing through Wentworthville this morning I thought I would check out this place again to see if there was any change in the services they're offering. They had a special offer of a 70min oil massage for $79 which seemed reasonable value. 

I was ushered into one of the two rooms and asked to remove my clothes, but leave my undies on, so straight away it was obvious that I was again only going to get a straight massage. An attractive young ML came in and proceeded to give me a very good massage. It seems the owner of the place is choosing the ML's based on skill and looks, as both times the ML has been quite attractive. Such a shame they don't offer more.

Its clear that this place is only going to offer legit massage but, if you're after a good massage by an attractive young woman at a reasonable price, this is a good place to go.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Terrace Thai Massage & Day Spa

Phone : 8810 9661

Hours of Business : 10am to 8:30pm

Rates : $80/60 mins

Age : early thirties

Size/shape : slim, plain

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : No, not when cheaper massage, just as good, is nearby

My experience/comments : When I went to Jomjai nearby I noticed this place had changed its name, so I thought I should try it out again as well.

It is now much more upmarket, and the price reflects that. Gone are the two tiny cubicles on the ground floor. Now you go upstairs to where there are 4 or 5 massage tables separated by curtains.

It's still an undies on place, so no extras, but the massage was very good, including hot rocks. But when Jomjai provides precisely the same service for $20 less, there seems little reason to go here.

Apparently there was a change of ownership six months ago, so Mods you may want to change the title to reflect the new name of the shop.

Hi 

Not sure if this counts as a review but here goes anyway.


Janet's Chinese Health Therapy
1/57 Main St, Blacktown -  9891 3950



I went to this place about 3 weeks ago. I had a really stiff neck and was looking for a good massage with maybe a happy ending as well.
I have to say half my wishes was granted as massage was one of the best, but there was no happy ending as only proper massage done here.
I had the hour and from memory I think was about $60, they guy at front desk asked if I want to use health fund card but I was not really interested I just wanted to get massage for pain and was hopeful of happy ending for not pain but pleasure.
A girl came out told me to go with her, I think her name was Yukii or yuri or yumi something like that, she was only young and pretty. She really gave great massage but no happy ending. She did the walk on my back thing and that felt really really good and felt like it make a difference. 
After massage I felt really good and no stiff neck.
If I get sore muscle again I will go back but if not sore and want relax I will go some where else that give maybe happy ending.

PsÂ… the place is up the stair next to butcher shop in the main street.

Thanks

Zac

I went there the other day and the girl was so hot. Sadly massage only but I wished for so much more.

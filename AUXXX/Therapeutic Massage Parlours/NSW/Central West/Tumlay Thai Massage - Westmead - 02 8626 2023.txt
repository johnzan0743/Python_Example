I noticed this place a few days ago and went back this morning to try it out. It's quite small with two booths separated by a wall and two tables in each booth which can be separated by a curtain, but this would leave little room for the ml to move around. There appeared to be just two ladies there and I was greeted by Tonia (maybe it's actually Tania and I misheard due to the accent, although her English was generally good). I asked for an hour oil massage which was just $59 - bargain! She took me over to the booth and asked me to undress. She didn't mention anything about undies so I took them off and lay down on the table (although another punter came in after me for a half hour massage and the other ml asked him to undress but keep his undies on). When she returned she covered me with a towel and started the massage. Chatting with her I found out that the place has been there for a year and that she works there on Wednesday and Thursday only. She comes from Issan in the North east of Thailand, which is where she was trained in massage. Her training must have been good because her massage was excellent! She had just the right pressure and massaged every part of me, except my tackle, very thoroughly.

Whilst she mostly kept me covered with the towel she wasn't obsessively careful and I let her know that I wasn't shy and wasn't concerned about being covered with the towel. There was a bit of incidental tackle tackle but nothing deliberate, but my erection on turnover would have shown her I was appreciating the attention, and she didn't bother holding up the towel while I was turning over so she got a good long look at my cock. She also massaged my stomach and got very close to my cock, which of course just made me harder! I got the impression that she might have been enjoying teasing me a little. 

This is definitely a place to return to for massage as both the price and the massage were excellent, but I was left very horny so had to then visit one of my favourite places just down the road for some relief!

Just a short note on my second visit here. I had very sore shoulders and so needed a good genuine massage and so thought of this place given the great value for money and skillful massage. The thing that made this visit worth another post is that Tania was even more relaxed with me this time and used just a small towel to cover me, which she moved around quite a bit and so often wasn't covering me very strategically at all. Again she wasn't concerned about covering me on turnover and the last part of the massage left me completely exposed. She was also even more intimate with the massage, going awfully close to what would be tackle tickle more than once. As well, the light was on in the room this time (it was off last time and very dark) and so I could see her better and she was much more attractive and slimmer than I recalled, with a really lovely smile.

The massage was again excellent, and I was lucky to see her as two people came in after me wanting to see her, so obviously her skills are becoming well known. I'm going to have to become a regular though, and see if this leads any further! Even if it doesn't the massage is just great (and excellent value!)

Having just been for a procedure at a specialist centre in Westmead I was walking to my car and noticed this place so I thought I would give it a punt, it looked legit and they offer health fund rebates which is generally a sure sign that the place is legit but that is OK I was after a good massage and if any incidentals happened along the way then it would be a bonus.

The place is quite small and clean , only really a few curtained booths so it was clear from the start that this is a legit place, my masseuse who I think was called Tania looked quite slim and I thought would not be capable of the strong massage but I was after proved me wrong, very strong with great technique.  There were no pretences with her she showed me the booth told me to strip and leave the undies on.   I have to say that the massage was first class, suitably firm where needed and hit the right spots she seemed quite well trained or just experienced at massage, next time I will opt for a 90 minute massage.

In the time that I was there two females came in asking for a massage and so when I was complete one of them was seated waiting outside my curtained booth for her turn with my masseuse so I would suggest gentlemen that to try it on for extra's here is a real no go.  As all Thai massage places offer a tea or cold drink at the end of the massage I sat next to the waiting lady to have my tea as the place is small and the seating limited.

I thought the massage was excellent and I will definitely go back again for a legit massage in future.

I've seen Tania many times since my last review but never progressed any further than a very good massage.

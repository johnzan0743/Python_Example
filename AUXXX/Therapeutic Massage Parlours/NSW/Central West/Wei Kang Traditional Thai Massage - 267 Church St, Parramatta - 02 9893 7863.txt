My experience/comments: 

Was in Parramatta last week for a meeting and was stood-up (you know who who you are!!)  so thought I would wander the streets.

Stumbled across this place and it seemed to have some of the RNT cues we have all come to recognise. Headed up the stairs to see what was on offer.

Greeted by mamasan (who was quite cute I must say) and agreed to go for the 1hr option.

Jessie took me to the room and asked me to strip down. The room was your typical asian massage set-up - massage table in the middle of the room, shelves with the supplies in the corner, fan on the floor... The room seemed clean, the walls are only 3/4 though, but they do have proper doors.

Jessie returned to the room once I had a chance to strip down and get ready. She asked the hard, medium, soft question - I opted for the medium.

Jessie was rather attractive, and appears to have a nice set of c-cups on her. She was pleasant throughout, and like many ML's, is here studying and massaging in her spare time.

Her massage was what I would call relaxing rather than remedial or sensual. Not bad if that is what you are after. There was no tackle tickle at all.

About 30 mins in it was turn-over time.  She began massaging my legs and I couldn't help but notice she spent considerable time staring at little BAB. I would like to think it was because she was fantasising about what little BAB could do to her, or perhaps what she would do to little BAB. Maybe this is just my wishful thinking....

Anyway, she spent the next 15 or 20 mins massaging my legs, chest, head & neck. She then got me to sit-up and gave my shoulders and neck more of a going over. Then with about 10 mins to go on the clock she tells me time was up. Thinking at thus stage I had nothing to lose, I asked Jessie if a HJ was available. Her reaction I found rather amusing. In a very apologetic manner she advised that she did not do this. She must have apologised about 4 or 5 times. I almost thought she was going to give me a HJ out of sympathy. I must have really looked like I needed one!!

In summary, massage was OK, ML was very cute and pleasant, I got the impression that with some of the girls extras are on the cards, but I did get dudded 10 mins.

Cheers,

BAB

Don't know about you fella's but the first thing I thought of when I saw the name of this place was what an apt name for a RnT ! 

There should be more clearly named places for us dumb punters like the jewellery shops in Hong Kong all named Fuk Hing...

I will preface by saying i saw 2 of the girls, one about 3 times and she would not do hj but her massage was still sensual and was some ball touching whilst i was forced to give myself a helping hand.. cannot remember her name... The other did give me hj and as i saw her after I had seen the cute mamasan, the mamasan knew who would make me happy... again i cannot remember this girls name but she was less attractive than the first girl.. sorry i could be of no help with the names

I have tired Poi A few times she is well worth it if you enjoy a massage more then any extras. I have seen her multi times for a nude massage which she has no problem with but she will not give you any extras. I have offered her alot of times but she wont accept. She will allow you to touch her a bit and will let you have a wank while she is giving her massage without a problem.

All in all she doesnt do any extras but I kept going back as it was close and the massages were really good!

My experience/comments:

She probably the only girl that works here that is willing to provide some sort of extra. While she was giving me a massage in the nude and a bit of talking here and there she was willing to give me a handjob for an extra $20. She wouldn't take off her clothes but will allow touching while doing the deed. 

She said she is a uni student learning English, as they all are lol. She studies in the City and this job is great for her to make extra money. She doesnt usually do hj as the boss is strict. All and all average massage and average hj.

Armed with information from this site (which I love) I found myself parking outside this joint today. As I was going in I noticed a smokin hot Chinese girl walking up the street and I am thinking wow I would love it if she was a ML, LOL. Anyway I go in up the stairs and I am greeted by a fat Thai girl, I ask her if they do Chinese massage and she says no only Thai massage and I thank her and turn to leave. Who should be coming up the stairs but the girl from the street turns out she is the cute mamasan quoted here by you and others.

I say hello, she introduces herself as Amanda and I go to leave and she asks why I am not staying, I wisper to her that I like Chinese girls and not Thai girls and she says "I am Chinese I will do for you".......bingo I love it when a plan works.  

Head into the room opposite the reception desk and the first thing I notice is the couch, I would love to be having some fun on that with Amanda the Chinese MILF. Strip off and Amanda comes in and immediately sheds the coat and the cardigan she is wearing. What is left is a little black dress, black stockings and stiletto boots and she proceeds to begin the most fantastic massage, this girl really knows what she is doing and works and cracks most parts of my anatomy during the first 40 mins or so. At one point she got up onto the table hitched up her skirt and had my head between those stocking covered thighs whilst she worked on my back. This girls is sensual and she really worked it, on the turn over I was obviously enjoying the attention. She stands at the head of the table and bends down over me whilst she is rubbing my stomach with her breasts firmly in my face and I am starting to get excited about how this is going to end. A lot of rubbing and pushing around the good bits but no actual touching of the shaft and when pressed she says "I don't do that sorry" WTF.

She didn't mind if I did though and even put the oil on little Sparksy for me to start off. Now it took a bit of convincing but within a couple of minutes she is playing with my balls and rubbing my arse but still not wanting to stroke the shaft. I am rubbing up and down her leg and then I thought i will go for gold and starting rubbing Amandas arse, she seemed to like that and with some soft moans started to get a little more interested. As I am rubbing her pussy through the stockings I hitch up her skirt and see a lovely little G string underneath but she is shy and quickly pulls it back down again saying "I don't normally do this"  Blah Blah Blah.

Finally she gets the message and realises that if she works hard on the shaft the job will be done and starts the tug proper applying more oil and stroking nicely. I was dry humping her through her stockings and underpants with my fingers and she was responding with the right faces and noises and started to get into it just and I emptied.........WOW that was sensual. Clean up and more suggestions of I don't do this for anyone you are special etc and I honestly believe her that she probably is very restricted and Chooses carefully in this area so YMMV definately with this one but if you can crack it wow. Anyway whats the worst that can happen? A fantastic massage with a totally hot bodied, cute and friendly Asian mamasan to pass the day, not too shabby!!

Amanda works 7 days and she was just arriving when I got there at 11.00am so I would probably ring. She seems a little suspisious about why I wanted her so be carefull about what you say, don't say a friend recommended her as she will obviously know who that friend is, treat her nice and with respect and she may develop into a real find. I would love to give that couch a workout with Amanda, dream on maybe one day!!!!!!!!!!

$35/30 $50/45 $60/60 no additional toll asked but obviously up to you although I think she would almost be embarrased to take it she is trying hard to make a go of this business and has owned it for just over 1 year. Also while I was there I saw a couple of attractive Thai girls so she has that covered but as reported she may have them on a tight leash.

BAB give her a go

Was staying in Parramatta last week and feeling a bit toey.

Normally stay in Chatswood but had no option this time.

Checked this site for recommendations and decided to try Wei Kang as it was just down the road in Church St.

Up the stairs I went, smelt nice and clean with a nice receptionist who turned out to be Amanda mentioned earlier.

I went for a Thai massage which Amanda started. She is Chinese and a really horny looking MILF, in the style of Natalie at Tiandi in Chatswood.

She started with a sort of body rub with her boobs and pussy on my back. Hey, I thought, I'm in luck.

But unfortunately, the place was so busy that she had to go back to the reception and I ended up with a young Thai girl whose I don't remember.

The rest of the massage was straight Thai with all the clapping on the back at the end.

I had to keep my jocks on all through the massage which was strange.

But It was my first time.

I liked Amanda so I tipped her $20 on the way out to sow the seeds for next time.

Two days later, I went back and got to the top of the stairs and there was Amanda, still looking horny but she qwas busy talking to her boss, the big Chinese lady so I got passed onto another young Thai girl.

This time, I had an oil massage for one hour ($90) hoping my luck would change.

But after a nice straight massage with my jocks off, nothing happened and as I was right next to reception (each booth is open at the top), it was a bit hard to ask for a hj or anything else.

As mentioned by a punter earlier, Amanda is the one and I would highly recommend her to all our punting friends if you can book her in advance and insist on a Chinese massage.

I will be back as its good value for money and Amanda is good value just to look at and talk to and anything else you can get!!!

I have been a few times - and find Amanda entrancing also. I had hoped that her recommendations to the Thai girls might have produced results, but last week had the first
underwear on massage with Victoria (I think). The girs are always very nice, but my visits have not ended in the expected relief.

Amanda is the owner. She usually does not do massages but some times when its busy she will. Out of all tie times i have been here, over 20, I have gotten the offer of a HJ about 4 times. It just depends on the girl.

Person's Name: Vicky

Establishment : Wei Kang Traditional Thai Massage

Date of Visit: 07/05/14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 267 Church St Parramatta 02 9893 7863

Hours of Business: 10am to 9pm 7 days

Rates: 30/60 mins $35/$60

Age: Late 20's

Size/shape: Tall and attractive

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai

Services Provided: Massage

Value for money/recommend?: Yes

My experience/comments: It's easy to walk past this place as it's just a doorway entrance amongst all the shops. There are 7-8 massage rooms, all with doors once you get upstairs. I was there just before noon and there were two ladies, both Thai, although the name and look of the place would suggest that it's Chinese (which it once was - the loyalty card I was given describes it as a Chinese Medical Clinic). I asked for the hour oil massage and when I saw it was just $60 I thought it was likely that the massage wouldn't be much good and that there was bound to be at least a hj offered in order for the ml to make some money. I was asked to go into the room immediately adjacent to the reception area, undress and lie face down on the table, which I did. I noticed that there was a box of tissues on the side table, which I took as a good indicator that a hj would be offered, as I never see tissues in the fully legit places.

I undressed completely and lay face down on the table and the tall attractive ml came in and introduced herself as Vicky. She put a towel on me (which I hadn't noticed at the bottom end of the table) and started the massage. It was excellent! Her English is very good and we had a good chat, and I was thinking that if I can get a massage this good, with such an attractive lady, and a hj as well, this will become my new favourite place! Alas, whilst she was quite casual with the towel so that it didn't always cover me properly, her massage never got at all intimate, and my hopes of a hj began to fade. After turnover she concentrated on my feet and didn't go near little Charlie at all. She also had a booking come in and so, while she didn't short my time (in fact she probably went over) she left as soon as she finished and so there wasn't any opportunity to ask for any extras.

However, even without a hj, this is absolutely one of the best value Thai massages I've had, it even included hot rocks! I'll definitely be going back again. Should any extras be offered in future that will just be a bonus!

Extras use to be a good chance at this shop.  Even Amanda provided an excellent HJ one time when the other girls were busy.  Her massage was 10/10 also but they changed their business model I suspect due to council warnings and the fact that a lot of their clientele is female based on my visits that the shop is profitable without extras.  Hopefully this has/will change.

Yes, it looks classy enough to appeal to women, and the booking that Vicky had was a woman. Still an excellent massage at a great price though!

Person's Name : Suria (sounded like Syria)

Establishment : Melody Health Care

Date of Visit : Tue 05/12/18

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 28/42-44 Dunmore Street Wentworthville 0452 657 255 & 02 9896 2258

Hours of Business : 9:30am to 6:00pm

Rates : 60/$55 WeChat December special

Age : late 30s, early 40s

Size/shape : 10

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Massage + HE

Value for money/recommend? : OK, I just wish the store was cleaner

My experience/comments : I'd been reading posts from punters talking about ML interactions via WeChat ("people nearby function"). So I gave that a whirl. 

TBH, this exercise was more miss than hit but eventually I found "Amy" whose profile pic appeared attractive. She posted some December specials and a landline number to call. So I did. After struggling with the receptionist, I eventually booked Suria for early morning session. Amy did not work Wednesdays. 

I parked the car on south side of the station and noticed the great number of garish massage shops vying for your discerning dollar and laden testicles. 

Got to The Mall which should be renamed "The sMall" as there were many vacant stores. The RNT place was not hard to find. I reckon it's the busiest shop therein. 

The shop is quite small with 3-4 tables partitioned with curtains. There's a small receptionist table at front left where your name gets ticked off the list and are assigned to your ML. While I was there at least 2 other punters came in. At least 1 came in for therapeutic treatment. 

Suria is plain to the eye but she's neatly dressed and presentable. She's a lean, wiry type with strong strokes but provides an excellent massage. There was plenty of TT from early on so no dramas there. She did ask for problem areas to focus on but even with minimal instructions she knows what the deal is. There was also little opportunity for chitchat given the cramped setting and "Clair de lune " on loop.  I'd recommend an extra tissue to cover the pillow donut you rest your face on for that extra degree of separation from other punters. I don't think they wash these often, nor the heavy curtains around or the linen you lay on. 

The massage/business part took 45-50 minutes and post flip, was all about the pleasure end. The transaction was a cursive glance to my full mast, then a nod from me followed by a finger "V" denoting a $20 fee for HE. Then Suria got to work. 

Suria has a strong grip but doesn't choke your baby. She appeared to enjoy playing with a hard cock and does her HJ with a mixture of long and short strokes plus a variety of speeds. I prefer languid sedate stroking and signalled so

I gotta say that I enjoyed Suria's HJ and blew copious amounts. She cupped my produce and poured onto a towel. She approved of my effort. 

Suria returned shortly after with a hot towel to clean me up then allowed me to regain composure. 

I enjoyed the massage and HE but would prefer cleaner, more secluded surroundings. 

There were 2 other MLs available: Yanni & Amy.   They too appeared well groomed and eager to please. 

Happy punting!

This is very interesting HT. This shop is the sister shop of Cure massage in Parramatta and May is the boss of these two shops and one in Neutral Bay as well. I assumed they were all legit. I wonder if the ML May is the same May as the boss. I would love a session with her. Any further intel you have would be greatly appreciated. MB

I am sure Amy is 100% legit as I put it on her and she said no way. But having experienced a nice HJ in her Parramatta shop I would say this is just a case of rogue workers who will be weeded out like the two at Parramatta when she finds out. I will give this place a go and report back

Cheers

Thanks for this review HT. Im amazed you got this service at what has always looked to me like a typical no nonsense husband and wife shopping centre massage shop. I'll have to try it next time I'm in the area.

Hey no dramas Charles. TBH, I didn't get the feeling I was breaking new ground. Who knows, maybe the girls were having a quiet week and were milking every dollar to tide them over Xmas?

Person's Name : Gay (or Kay) and Lo

Establishment : Melody Health Care

Date of Visit : Sat 15/12/18

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 28/42-44 Dunmore Street Wentworthville 0452 657 255 & 02 9896 2258

Hours of Business : 9:30am to 6:00pm

Rates : $60/60 mins

Age : late twenties; early thirties

Size/shape : slim and short; chubby and short

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai; PRC

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Curiosity got the better of me and so I tried this place this afternoon. I asked for an hour and Gay said she would only be able to do half an hour, as she had a booking, but that the other girl would be finished by then so she could take over. I said that was fine.

The rooms are very small and just have a heavy curtain across them. Gay's massage was good and she even used a couple of hot stones, saying she does that even in standard oil massage when the boss isn't there. When she got to my legs she started on one and moved the towel so far over it wouldn't have covered anything and as she massaged me it slowly slid off further. 

It was then time for the swap though, and Lo came in. Lo started on my other leg, and she was just as careless about covering me. Neither of them were particularly intimate, but the potential was there.

Lo asked me to turn over, and didn't worry about the "holding up the towel" business, but then covered me strategically with the towel. She asked if I wanted a head massage, and I thus thought that nothing further would happen. I said yes, but instead she started to massage my stomach, moving lower and lower and smiling at me. I smiled encouragingly back, and she made the sign for a hj. I nodded, she rubbed her fingers together, I held up two fingers. She smiled, removed the towel and gave me a very pleasant and skilful hj which soon had me over the line. 

When I had arrived she had been massaging a woman, and the appointment Gay had was with a woman as well. To me the sound of the hj would have been very obvious, and I wondered if the woman customer realised what was going on. Interestingly, the sounds coming from the previous female customer of Lo's, sounded suspiciously like the woman was orgasming. Maybe she provides a similar service for women!

I went this afternoon after booking. Turned up on time and just chose to take who was assigned to me. Rose was assigned to me, attractive face but large body, seemed friendly enough. Paid up the $55 and into the first room, just heavy curtain separating your modesty and the outside world.Undressed naked as I always do but covered the butt with a towel son nobody could see as Rose entered. She arrived and rearranged the towel and started a nice relaxing and competent massage.
Anyone seeking a RELAXING massage should see Rose, she knows her stuff. As I was there many people came in and were using their health fund card, woman and men, its quiet a busy place.
Rose gave me the full hour and I really enjoyed the massage, got into EVERY nook and crevice  As stated its not as clean as Parramatta and as I was leaving I saw Rose did not replace the tissue top on the table?? this is questionable hygiene.
Massage 8/10
Facilities 5/10
Attitude 9/10
Follows Directions 10/10

Add Rose to the list of must see ladies here. Lets keep compiling names of ones we WANT to see.

enjoy

Amy, oh what a girl, let’s just say it was far from a waste of time or money. Actually probably the best money I have ever spent on massage.

Go you won’t be disappointed, sorry full review for Gold members and above only.

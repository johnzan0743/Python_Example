 Goldern Finger Massage Rawson St AUBURN (opp the Station on the north side)
				
Post Content: 
Whilst driving for OLA & BOLT though Rawson Street opp the Railway Station (UBER the cunts cut me off a year ago after having driven 9,425 Uber Passengers in which 5 have made a complaint on things I have said or a story and when a Girl who was pissed wanted me to pick her up on a T Intersection / Cross Way, in which I chipped her for a 3 Km ride sacked me any back to the story;
Sign out the front GOLDEN FINGER MASSAGE which sounds interesting, "Golden Finger" hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm so I parked the Auto and rang asking for a mature ML
Well they, 4 of them were MILFY but not too aged. The joint at the top of the stairs has 4 rooms (or more) with walls to the roof and doors that lock
it was this MILF's first day, she is a Chester Hill ML that does not mind offering her Crumpet if needed but I really didn't want a Root but only to see what the "Golden Finger Massage" is about.
Well after an Oily Massage she left the room to get a hot towel and a glass of water, what I didn't expect it was a glass of very hot water
After the flip and a play with the piddle, I negated a suck in the nude for the usual price but then whilst flat on my back she took the very hot water a put in her mouth then gobbled my cock  swishing around and I am not sure if I loaded her mouth with SeaRay Cum or I shot over her face ?
The problem was she burnt the inside passage of my cock or she may have bittern as I have still a sore cock
No phone number in this post, just rock up

On another note the SeaRay has been fucking dozens of Privates and has discovered new RnTs but I am so buggered after driving OLA & BOLT from 6am to 7pm  Monday to Friday, I am too buggered to write new adventures

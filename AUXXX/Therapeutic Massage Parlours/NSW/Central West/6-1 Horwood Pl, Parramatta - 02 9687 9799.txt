shop 6, 1 Horwood Pl
PARRAMATTA, NSW, 2150

local (02) 9687 9799 

$60 per hour

Went to this place at Parramatta 2 months ago on a Saturday afternoon. 

When I first got in the shop, a woman emerged from another cubicle/ curtained off section seeming to do up her jeans. I immediately thought "well this is interesting". She was nice looking and not as traditionally dressed as the other one that I was eventually referred to. Unfortunately I didn't get her.
Another one came out and she then showed me to the room. She was traditionally dressed in a long wraparound skirt. She asked me to get undressed and leave undies on. I did so but it was quite a while before she returned. I was on a tight schedule so started to get a little impatient. 

Started the heavier than expected rubbing, elbows and knuckles. It was heavier than expected and hurt a little the next day. Still felt an air of anticipation during the massage, but no great surprises in the end. She applied the oil as required and gave a few moans when she reached around the butt. Tried to engage her in conversation and told me she was from Chaing Rai (in the north east of Thailand).
Asked her about her job, life in Sydney, life back home etc. I always like to talk a little and try and engage the MLs. In this case it didn't do me a lot of good, she wasn't very talkative.

Usually after a massage, you should drink some fluids such as water or tea. This is usually offered and in fact was offered at the end when she left the room. But by the time I got dressed ready to leave, nothing was on offer. I had kind of forgotten about it anyway, but felt a bit annoyed that she hadn't remembered to get it for me.
Would I return: Maybe.

[COLOR=#000000]  [/COLOR][COLOR=#3E3E3E]Have been to this establishment several times with mixed results early on but later many extras. First time no extras at all but later with different girls got much more. One time even got FS with would write a report but can't remember her name and she no longer works there. There were 2 girls working Pinky and Ou (that's what it sounds like) and both are lookers. I have Ou before and she happily does a nude HJ. Paid pinky $75 for the massage and she ask if I want HE and I agree and pay the extra $50. She strips from the start and she has a sensational body with small tits but huge nips she is a little self conscious about them, I loved them. The massage only went for 15 mins till I started feeling her up. She let me explore all over her body sucking and licking nothing off limits with the exception of full insertion of the finger. Bought her to orgasm and then continued to play with her arse and she happy to let me a long way there too. Finally she finished me off and cleaned me up. There is a shower but another punter was in there when I finished so it was clean up with a hot towel. Pinky says she only works here on Fridays and some other days in Ultimo. I think FS may be available in the future she hinted that way. Massage 3/10(who cares) HJ 9/10, Looks 8.5/10. I would recommend Pinky and Parra Thai Spa.[/COLOR]

I checked this place out today. I wasn't sure if I was in the right place as it looked legit as the place only had curtains seperating each massage bed. The massage girl did ask if I had been here before but stupidly said no. With 5 mins to go she did mention that this is speacial place and gave the prices. $50 for no clothes and you can touch and $20 for he. With 5 mins to go. I declined but I said I ll have to try it out next time. Definitely going back for a try.

Tried this place out based on reviews above. Same sort of story as above but worst rnt experience by far.
Massage by one lady and June comes back for last 5 mins. Bigger girl with massive boobs.
$50 with clothes on. Settled on $30. Was like robot with no interest and wouldn't even look at you. Clean up was a joke afterwards and looked upset when I used the towels, so guess they don't use clean ones between customers. Moody chick who then becomes your best friend when time to collect money.
With just curtains and size of shop no way I would try anything else and would not recommend.

[COLOR=#000000]  [/COLOR][COLOR=#3E3E3E]Had some spare time on Thursday decided to return to see if I could be lucky and get Pinky, but she wasn't working. Walked in ask for 1 hour shown to the room (all the others are curtained off) stripped and when she returned asked if I wanted extras I ask what extra's were on offer and how much. She replied everything for $80 of $50 for a HJ. I opted for the lot. Massage was reasonable if a little limited in coverage. On turnover it was into the extras, she domed me up started with a CBJ which ok a bit too much teeth then on with FS. She was tight and enjoyed it from on top, missionary and doggy. Ask if anal was on offer but no. Finished off in the doggy position satisfied and had a shower to clean up. Overall Massage 5/10, CBJ 4/10, FS 6.5/10 Looks 7/10. The only criticism is she was too mechanical for me I prefer more reaction even if it is fake.[/COLOR]

Went back again with some extra cash but got allocated a ml in her 40s by the looks of her but she didn't offer any extras. But then again probably wouldn't have taken the offer either.  This was on a Saturday.  Do the good ones only work certain days. Which are the best days?

I would suggest ringing first. Vicky & Pinky both offer and there is another girl with a name like Ou. She does extras as well. Call before you go and book one of these good luck next time.

Person's Name: Vicky

Establishment: Parrathai Spa

Date of Visit: 30/4/2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6/1 Horwood Place Parramatta Ph: 9687 9799

Hours of Business: 10am to 9pm

Rates: $75/60mins oil massage plus $100 for FS

Age: mid 40s

Size/shape: Small breasts but very large nipples

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai

Services Provided: Massage FS.

Value for money/recommend: Not really

My experience/comments: From the outside this place looks legit, but as soon as you walk inside it's obvious it's a rnt place. Everything is quite makeshift with handwritten prices and hand written notes on the wall saying no sex offered, and the cubicles are all just curtains hung on unfinished wooden posts and beams. I was greeted by a small attractive Thai woman, who I subsequently found out was Vicky. She asked if I had been before and I said yes (knowing that's always the best answer!) and I opted for the hour massage and gave her two fifties. She took me past the 3 or 4 curtain cubicles (which have curtain walls as well) through a curtain at the back and into one of two narrow curtained cubicles at the back. She then left to get my change and so I undressed and laid down on the table. There was no sign of a towel to drape over myself. 

She came back and gave me the change and started the massage by washing my feet and then started a very average massage using baby oil, not the scented oil you get in legit Thai places. She didn't ask how much pressure I wanted, and her massage was generally pretty soft with some delicate touches thrown in. After what seemed like about 15 mins she started on some tackle tickle and then asked me to turn over after a few minutes of this. She then asked whether i wanted a hj or fs, and I opted for fs. She said this would be $100. I tried to negotiate her down but she held her ground and so I agreed. She asked for the $100 up front so I had to get up, fish out my wallet, and find another two fifties which I gave to her. She then left.

She came back shortly with a little bag of tricks and pulled out a dom and put it on me. She then stripped off, showing a nice body with small tits and large nipples. I played with her pussy, which was a little hairy, and then she climbed up and started to ride me in cowboy. However I couldn't seem to penetrate her very far and I kept on popping out, so we moved to missionary. However the same problem occurred. It was as if her pussy wasn't very deep and so I couldn't push in very far and so every time I started to really pump I would pop out. She could tell I was getting frustrated and she suggested a hj. This was excellent and she also offered to slide a finger in to massage my prostrate, but I declined as I was afraid I would crap if she did! My orgasm was still powerful and sprayed all over the place as she made no attempt to guide it on onto my belly or into a tissue (in fact there didn't seem to be any tissues). She then wiped me down with a towel and got dressed. She finished the massage with a short massage of my head and shoulders, again pretty ordinary.

During all of this there were other ladies sitting just outside the curtain so they could have had no doubt about what was going on as the sounds of fucking were obvious. I was also disconcerted when, instead of changing the sheet on the bed afterwards, she just turned it over, as it must have had some of my cum on it. I was glad I was there early and clearly the first customer of the day! And when I looked at the clock I realised that I couldn't have been there more than 40 mins absolute max, and indeed it felt more like a 30 min session than 60 mins!

In summary, this place is clearly really a fs shop, but is pretty poor value at $175 total, particularly for a service that goes nowhere near the full time. On my way out I saw another attractive and younger lady who might be worth seeing, but I would only go for half an hour, if that's all they're going to provide anyway, and $100 on top for fs seems pretty expensive!

Finally found this joint yesterday, didn't go in but walked past. Certainly looks legit on the outside, could see a not very attractive girl in overalls and a very nice pair of legs when I went past.

Hours of Business: 10am to 9pm

Rates: $55/30mins oil massage plus $50 for Cbj

Size/shape: Average height size 8, long black hair and some nice titties. Hot.

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai

Services Provided: Massage/CBJ

Value for money/recommend: Not really

This was a case of my dick leading my mind.

Emma was hotter than the MILF I was expecting to see. Young girl, good English, very attractive.

Rooms as described above, only had half an hour, paid $55. Emma asked if I wanted extras and I suggested a nice massage and finished by blowing me would be great. $50 was the price offered and I knew it was too much but couldn't resist.

Started with a back massage which was nice enough, some tackle play, lotsa rubbing of her breasts on me.

Rolled over after about 15 minutes, the dom went straight on and I got a good, bug nog spectacular CBJ that got me over the line. No touching of the face or downstairs was allowed, so at $110, it was an expensive Cbj by a hit young Thai girl.

Emma works Thursdays and Fridays.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6/1 Horwood Place Parramatta Ph: 9687 9799

Hours of Business: 10am to 9pm

Rates: $55/30mins oil massage plus $60 for nude hj

Age: late 30s/early 40s

Size/shape: Curvy with large breasts/slim with small breasts

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai

Services Provided: Massage and nude hj

Value for money/recommend: Expensive!

My experience/comments: Well this was interesting. I was horny after getting a legit massage at a new Thai place nearby so thought I would pop in here to get some quick (albeit expensive) relief. I walked in and a curvy milf, Coco, looked surprised to see me. I asked for a 30 min oil massage and she took me through to the back curtained off areas. I stripped off and lay down, but when she came back she put a towel over me. Her massage was okay, although a lot of it was her kneeling on me and using her weight to massage my back and shoulders. She was having an extended session with the ml in the next booth, so there was obviously another punter next door (separated only by a curtain - no walls in this place!)

The towel was removed for the massage on my legs, and there was plenty of tackle tickle during this. She then tapped me on the bum to signal it was time to turn over. I did so and was surprised to see Vicky instead of Coco. At some point they had done a switch, I'm not sure when, but possibly when the towel was removed for the leg massage. She made hand signals (clearly because of the punter on the other side of the curtain) asking if I wanted a hj or fs, and I indicated just a hj (as I knew fs with her just wasn't worth it). I tried haggling over the price but she could see my rock hard dick and knew she had me where she wanted me and so it was still $60, including nude!

I got the relief I needed but it was unexpected having the switch done, and disappointing, as I was looking forward to seeing Coco's large breasts. Clearly though, she doesn't provide anything more than massage! As I left I noticed that all the booths seemed to be occupied, and Vicky had to unlock the door to let me out, so obviously business is good despite their expensive service!

Services Provided : Massage + FS

Value for money/recommend? : NO !!

My experience/comments : I had seen this place often and yesterday on a whim decided to call in  -  wish I had saved my money !!!  Only girl available at the time was Vicky - quite pretty and friendly (but prices herself way over the top for the service).
Massage started out with lots of oil and was fairly ordinary.  After about 10 minutes (into the hour session paid for - $75) Vicky whispers to I want B2B.  I ask what about full service and she says $150.  Stupid me thinks $150 all up including the $75 already paid so I reach for my wallet and hand over another $75. Vicky gives me a strange look and then explains $150 for FS.  I say no way give me my money back and just continue with the massage.  With this she negotiates down to $100 FS and again stupid me says OK.  Vicky strips off starts with the usual mucking around (but NO kissing, NO licking her nipples, NO this and NO that) and then she is on top for some cowgirl but does not allow full penetration. After a while she says she will make me cum with HJ  -  I say no and roll her over for some missionary  -  still she holds her legs up to my chest and does not allow full penetration.  After a bit I stand on the floor and try to put her legs over my shoulders - but NO holds herself in such a way to prevent full penetration. I am a bit frustrated by now so I tell her to give me a HJ to finish and then back to massage.  Vicky'd HJ was with plenty of oil and actually quite good. Dropped my load and she say thanks very much for coming  -  WTF  - I still have about 15 minutes on the clock. Damn it I was out of there 15 minutes early for an all up rip-off of $175  -  I am thinking I must be stupid !!!     Too expensive, lousy massage, lousy FS but good HJ.  I will not go back.

Yep same BS performance with me and I resisted the offer of FS for $100 and just paid an additional toll for HJ I think $100 all up nude and HJ same thing but no where near as good as most Thai places for $60 total rubbish and only trading on horny old fuckers that stagger out of the legit places in Parramatta and need to be relieved after a Thai MILF has started them up and not driven them to conclusion!

My experience/comments : 

Had some late night shopping to do at Parra, so decided to pop in to relieve those sore knots. I was greeted at the door by Vicky - small Thai lady with an average looking face but beautifully shaped pins. There are no proper rooms that I saw at this place...just divisions separated by heavy curtains - you could most certainly here the conversations and other things going on in the other partitions...

Vicky begins by wiping my feet and moving on to a firm massage. She has a nice technique and likes sitting on the table, while pushing her leg on my crotch giving me a big noticeable stiffy! Not before long, she started a tackle tickle and flipped me over. This is where the haggling begins. She wanted $50 for a HJ at first...and wanted another $50 to get naked. She said more was to offer. BUT...no way for the prices she quoted!!! I said I only had $50 left and we settled for a nude massage. She has a nice slow rhythm and makes slow circular motions on the tip. No touching of her pussy was allowed but I did get to feel her soft breasts. Finished off and gave me a powerful strong blow all over her hands...

We only used up about 50 minutes of the time, but all in all a competent massage and HJ. Not the worst place...but there are better ones in the area...

I did glimpse a younger Thai lady on my way out, but not sure if there is more to offer with her...I think she could have been the Emma that you mentioned, sydguy74...

My experience/comments : 

Such a warm and muggy day - I was feeling especially horny so I decided to ring in for an appointment. Today, only Jenny was working. Jenny is a pretty Thai girl with a nice pair of pins. She ushered me into the curtained petitions and asked me the usual - how long, what kind of massage? I asked upfront if extras were available and she quoted $50 for a nude HJ. Proceeded with a good, well pressured Thai massage - focusing on the back and the kidney areas. This is genuinely a good massage...

When she went out to get the hot towel...I already knew what was coming up and by the time she was back...I had pitched the tent. She smiled at me in a cheeky way and said "someone's excited". She did a slow strip tease to reveal a nice c-sized pair which I enjoyed juggling in my hands. She started in a characteristic Thai fashion...slowly slowly massaging the rod until it was rock hard and glowing red. Then squeezed it in a circular motion until I exploded all over her hands and my belly...

Cleaned me up and offered me a shower. She's a nice girl with some bookings - another punter was already waiting. All in all, a bit pricey but better than last time...

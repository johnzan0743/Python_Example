Comments:  The lovely Amy texted to advise of a Cure Massage sister shop for remedial massage. Related to 267 Church across the street, the 222 Church Cure shop is in the Greenway Plaza, and like 267, also has had some Thai staff. The Greenway Plaza can be accessed from Church or Horwood, with plenty of available parking nearby. The plaza was struggling with numerous shops closed/for lease and while the shop itself is also somewhat down market- the rooms have walls to ceiling, doors, but no facilities. 
This date, I asked for a session with Amy who met me at the reception table. She agreed and advised that they are authorised to be open, based on remedial qualifications allowing operations. OK for me, and I shall believe, as various other remedial shops have claimed similar approvals and seemed to be operating in the clear based on similar rationale. 
Amy provides a great FBM, oily, sensuous, gliding strokes like I prefer. At flip, she asked my preferences for next steps, which were unfortunately denied (albeit requested respectfully), but she did provide all the standard MP fun for the usual $50 toll that younger providers get for B2B. Well worth it for me as she is a lovely lady. She also made some humorous, clearly fake FOAMy noises and faces which added to the fun. She takes care of herself, wears sexy underwear, remains relaxed- almost all you can ask for from a session with a pretty Han Milf. 

The link here is an old promo from the Melody Healthcare, Wentworthville shop days (she appears at 1.07)- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hfwXKSeKgU   Yep, like a few others, I'm a fan.

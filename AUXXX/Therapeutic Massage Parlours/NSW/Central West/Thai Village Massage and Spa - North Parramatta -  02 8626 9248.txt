My experience/comments: I went here about 10am and was greeted by two attractive and friendly young Thai ladies. This shop appears to be part of a chain, but is unique amongst the chain in having a steam room. I opted for the "silver package" which included half an hour in the steam room and an hour and a half massage. There are two massage rooms on the ground floor and another three on the top floor with curtains on the doors and curtains between the rooms. I was taken by one of the ml's, whose name I found out later was Sine, into one room and was told to undress and then wrap a sarong around me, or use the bathrobe which was there as well. I opted for the sarong and just held it around me as she took me to the steam room, which was just a single person wooden box at the end of another curtained off area. I sat on a towel covered bench in the steam room and took off the sarong. 

The heat and humidity of the steam was great on a cold winters morning and I was soon feeling very relaxed, so relaxed in fact that I started to get an erection. Accordingly I took the opportunity to have a nice languid wank. There was a glass panel in the door of the steam room and, even though it was hazy because of the steam, I was thus able to see when Sine came back and so had time to take my hand off my cock. She opened the door slightly to ask if the heat was okay and I saw her look down at my hard cock. I told her the heat was fine and she closed the door. I continued to enjoy the heat and resumed the slow stroking of my dick. She came back again after about another ten minutes and opened the door to ask the same question and had another good look at my erection. Finally, after about another ten minutes, she came back to tell me that the time was up. I didn't hurry to pick up the sarong and hold it around me, and so she got another good look. She took me across to a small shower room and handed me a towel, so I dropped the sarong to free my hand to take the towel and thus gave her yet another look at my still turgid todger.

After the shower, I held the sarong around me and went to the massage room, where Sine told me to lie down on the table. I took the sarong off and handed it to her, and I saw her look once more down at my still semi-erect dick. After lying down, she put a towel on me but I told her I was too hot after the steam room, which was completely true, and so she took it off. She then proceeded to give me an absolutely superb, relaxing and quite sensual massage. As part of the package I'd opted for "pure cocoa body butter" and this was a great decision as it seemed to have a much more pleasant feel than oil. Combined with Sine's great skill this was one of the best massages I'd had. She also concentrated much more on my legs and bum, rather than my back, and her massage was quite intimate, although never became actual tackle tickle. I could have lain there in bliss forever, however the time eventually came when she asked me to turn over. Her sensuous massage had caused my dick to become hard again, however as soon as I turned over she put a towel on me. I said I didn't need it but she kept it on this time, perhaps because of my obvious erection. Oh well. 

She continued on with her excellent massage and I lay there in bliss until she finally told me that it was finish time. I got up and removed the towel and had a quick chat with her noticing that she checked out my now only semi-hard cock once more. She then left and I got dressed.

There is clearly no chance of a hj here, but the massage was one of the best I've had, particularly combined with the steam room (and not just for the flashing opportunities!). Its not the cheapest around, but you get what you pay for. If you want to try them out they have parking around the back and entry is via a boom gate, using the code 9620. It's also probably best to book as they said they can get busy (which I believe).

Sine is the girl on the left, and the girl on the right was the other one who was there. The photo actually doesn't do either of them justice!

On the strength of Charles review visited this place this morning.  Booked ahead for the 2hr silver massage package which includes the 30minute steam room.  The format was identical to Charles.  Taken into a massage room to get undressed and wear a sarong.  Then taken to steam room.  Once in the steam room i dispensed with the sarong.  Now Sine opened the door 2 times, the first to give a cup of water, second to ask if heat was ok.  She only definitely looked at my package the first time.  When she came to say time up though she got another good look as i stood up and walked out of the room naked before putting the sarong back on.  Then taken to shower.  Then taken to massage room.  

The massage itself was amazing.  I opted for hard, concentrating on the legs.  Now her massage was hard but not very hard, but she combines it well with slow sensuality.  Massages right into the groin.  My hard cock was in the way of my upper groin but instead of adapting her massage, she just touched it at least four times and definitely let her fingers linger on it the last time.  No other tickle tackle and not as sensual on the front massage though.  

The setup of the place prevented me asking for any extras.  Curtains dont fully close and all sounds would definitely travel quickly through the shop.  I do however think extras could be a possibility later in the evening if your massage finishes way after closing time.  I actually rang yesterday evening to book in and she said could give me 90 minute massage 7:30pm - 9pm (they close at 8) but i decided to wait until today.

With regards the looks of the masseuses.  Sine, my masseuse is attractive but is a bit too tall and stocky for my liking.  I'd say she looks better in the photo than in real life.  There was another girl there though (the one on the right in the photo) who is a definite looker, much better in real life than the photo.  I'm going to try and have her next time.

It's a great experience isn't it shaver, extras would certainly make it perfect! I plan to go again next week.

My experience/comments: I went back today to try the "Gold Package" as it included a "body scrub" and I was intrigued by what that would be. Sine wasn't there today but Rose, the other girl in the photo above remembered me. She appears to be the manager here. Besides Rose there were three other girls there today and I was massaged by a tiny thing called Minnie - what an appropriate name. She was so petite that I was worried that she might be very young, and when she was washing my feet before the massage I got a look down her top and could see she wasn't wearing a bra as it would have been quite superfluous since she didn't have any boobs! In chatting with her though it turned out she was 23 - she looked more like 13!!

The body scrub was first and this was just the application of a herbal smelling and roughish paste over my body. It was fine, but nothing special, however it did give opportunities for flashing as it necessitated a shower to wash it off before going into the steam room. However Minnie wasn't into the flashing game and every time she had a chance to look at my tackle she very deliberately turned her head away. When I was in the steam room she just called out to ask how I was, no opening the door and looking, and she also made me wear the robe rather than the sarong when moving around. The robe of course regularly came open but she would always turn her head away.

Her massage was very good, but not as sensual as Sine, and she was very careful about keeping me covered at all times.

Minnie was very friendly and nice but very serious about the massage. She told me she had only be working there a few days and only worked Thursdays and Saturdays. On other days she works as a barrista somewhere!

Charles, I just noticed during a cruise about today, that there is one of these massage chains in Blacktown too. I'll report if I get to visit soon. Located near Kmart behind Westpoint.

After a punt in the area (Jessica - Private), i was in the mood for a good massage. And this place fit the bill. As my above post, i had intended to check out the Blacktown branch first, but this was just too close to where i had parked to pass it up. Not to mention the fact that when i was paying for my parking ticket, a hot little thai hottie drove into the rear carpark (on her L's with an instructor) and walked into the back entrance. I gave it a few minutes and went in.

Hottie was indeed working there, and didn't find out her name until later on. She gave my feet a wash and prepp'd me for the massage, which as it turns out was fully legit massage, but i concur with the comments above, that the quality of massage here is excellent. My masseuse name was Nancy, and simply put, everything was spot on. Mind you, she whispered in my ear "is everything alright?" and i damn near barred up right there. But alas, i knew from the start nothing was gonna eventuate because i was told strictly to keep the undies on, and no tickles on inner thighs that would suggest or prompt anything else.

The hottie outside was Mimi. Now it could very well be the Minnie that Charles saw, but Nancy's pronunciation was Mimi. But what really got me going, was when i was sitting having the customary post-massage tea, in walks an even hotter chick in the short denim shorts and walks straight thru to the back as if her shift was starting. 

Pity no other stuff going on, but great legit massage.

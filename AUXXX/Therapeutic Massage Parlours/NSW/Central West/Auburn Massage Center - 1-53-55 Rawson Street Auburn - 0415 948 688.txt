My experience/comments : 

In the area and needed a rub, so Locanto search found this place. Just across from railway, with standard LED OPEN sign on street, up stairs to screen door and press bell for entrance.

Parking was tough, as its a busy area but got one about 2 blocks away, so a good pre massage rub.

So buzzed into a short corridor and ushered into a nicely set up room, with a good table, and couch and air conditioning. Proper room with walls to the ceiling.

$60 for 60 mins and mamsan heads off. I strip and in comes Edna, and she starts with "No English". 

She is cute, short about 5' 2" but nicely shaped. I managed to get her name but that was it. She shows me a bottle of oil and then down to the massage. Quite competent and worked out some knots. Good work on the arms and time spent on the hands and palm which is good, she did the legs but no feet. No Tackle tickle, the obligatory roll over and HJ gesture, and nod from me and hint to take her close off, 5 fingers shown and Pineapple handled over.

Nice young and firm body, natural boobs, and soft curves, bit chubby but nice. Gentle HJ and a bit of a cat bath on nipples, I was sucking her boobs, mimed DATY but a shake of head, a bit of outside stroking of her kitty and I could feel the wetness but nothing further. She then slid me across the table and cuddled up (hard to do on a massage table) and kept the rubbing up, which was a nice touch.

An ok experience, and ok for a first time visit. No chat as she really didn't have any English, other than good, ok and  thank you.

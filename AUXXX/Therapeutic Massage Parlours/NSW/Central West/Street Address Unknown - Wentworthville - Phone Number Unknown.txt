I stuck my head around the corner to see if it had opened, and was beckon in by a tall Chinese girl.
Fitted out with two rooms. Took everything off lay down on table.. Candy came in - $30 30min, gave her
$50 she returned with the change $20 put on table. No attempt to cover my posterior with towel,
and gave a good and sensual massage. When asked to turn over, Candy signaled the expected question
and took the $20. Really good empty - so much so my girl friend was puzzled two days later 
She stayed fully clothed, but didnt pull away my hand between her legs..

Partitions don't go to the ceiling - and an Indian female customer was in the next cubicle. Nevertheless
I'll be back.

Value 9/10
Massage 9/10

visted this place a couple of times now,

$30 for 30 mins, $50 for the hour, $20 tug

havent been able to get the girl topless both times ive been there.

On my first visit i was leaving the premises to see a young lady waiting to go in for a massage, so im guessing their 'trying' to make it look like a legit place.

tryed this place again last week, I think her name was sue but not sure, the massgae it self was ok but at turn over no touching no topless, I have tryed this place three times now so will not return, 
maybe im being a bit hard on this place, but with the service on offer at different places in the seven hills area it is hard to think of why one would return

Thanks,

BAB

Just to remove any potential confusion, there are two massage shops in close proximity here. There is the garish pink shop near the corner, and a few shops up is a Thai massage shop at No. 7. It appears that all the reports to date have been for the Chinese shop, so when I get the opportunity I'll toftt and try the Thai place (although it looks pretty legit).

Is there any way to edit posts? 

Anyway, I was in the area so dropped by to pick up a brochure (no time for a massage). The address is actually No.8 and it's called Ton Hom Thai Massage and they have a website at tonhomthaimassage - Home. Apparently they only opened a few weeks ago.

It's a very small place with just two rooms that look to be fitted out nicely - trying to look a bit up market, although they're in the most downmarket area of Wentworthville. It all looks pretty legit, although I was intrigued to see on the website that the MLs are "independent contractors". Not sure how to interpret that. There was just a single lady there when I popped in. I'll give an update after I've had a chance to get a massage.

Hi Charles,

Thank you for the information.

Do you mean this thread should split into two,

1 Chinese massage -  7 TheKingsway, Wenty - 02 XXXX XXXX
2 Ton Hom Thai massage - 8 The Kingsway, Wenty - 0435 953 460

with your posts in the second one ?

Hi Fartichoke,

Yes, I discovered the 20 min option after typing the last post. I was going to start a new thread for this place after having a massage there, so probably no need to split this one.

Cheers,
Charles

I finished work earlier than expected today so took a trip back to Wentworthville. The Thai place appeared to be closed so, to save a wasted trip I went to the pink Chinese place. However, the tall Chinese woman who came out was just so ugly that I couldn't bring myself to get a massage from her, so I left. It was fortunate that I did as the Thai place was now open. I'll do a separate thread for it, but the short story is that it is a completely legit place.

By the way, I notice there's another thread about this pink chinese place which is at 4 The Kingsway, so they could probably be merged.

I suggest this thread can definitely be merged with the 4 The Kingsway thread.

My experience/comments : This was a strange one. I'd read about this place in a bronze review which mentioned that an Indonesian girl worked here. This piqued my interest and I decided to try it out. It's located in the back of a small arcade with easy parking out the front, and so is quite discreet (there's also parking out the back I subsequently discovered). I arrived just after 10am to find a lady just opening up. She did look Indonesian and invited me straight in and into one of the rooms (I think there were three, none with floor to ceiling walls). She asked how long I wanted and I asked for an hour, as I do like the massage technique that all the Indonesian mls are trained in. I paid her the cash and she left while I got undressed and onto the table. I heard another bloke come into the shop at this point and she told him that she was the only one there but another girl was due soon. He said he would wait. The other girl came in about 5 minutes later and took him into another room for a 30 minute session.

Jenny came back into my room, but was quickly interrupted by another bloke coming into the shop. She went out and told him he'd have to wait half an hour. He agreed! She came back into my room, but then another bloke came in and she told him no-one was available, so he left. She came back in, but then another bloke came in! She went and sent him away too. I like to go to these shops early because they're normally quiet, but this was the busiest I've ever seen a rnt at this time of day!

Finally, after about ten minutes she was able to start the massage. She had an interesting technique, some of it was good, some wasn't (effectively just rubbing rather than massaging). It definitely wasn't the Indonesian technique I'm familiar with though. I asked her where she was from, and she said Indonesia, so I started chatting with her in Indonesian. She didn't appear to understand anything I said though! Either she isn't Indonesian (but she does look Indonesian) or she just doesn't want to speak Indonesian with a bule (which I've encountered before with the one other Indonesian wl I've been able to find in Sydney). I asked her (in English!) where in Indonesia she was from and she said Bali. It's possible also that she only speaks Balinese, but that would mean she hadn't been educated in Indonesia, as all Indonesians learn Indonesian in school so that they all speak Indonesian beside their own local dialect.

I kept on throwing some Indonesian into our conversation but she would just say 'yes' and smile, no matter what I said. It was very strange, but her English was good and she was perfectly friendly. Her massage of my back and legs included plenty of casual touching of my balls and dick, but not anything I would call tackle tickle. Quite early in the massage she asked me to turn over and continued the massage. There had been no towel from the beginning, so my hard cock was immediately on display, but she appeared to ignore it. She massaged my chest and then my legs, again with only casual touching of my cock and balls, but plenty of it. I was wondering if anything more was going to happen, and then I heard the unmistakable sounds of wanking from the room next door, and then a groan from the bloke in there as he obviously came. 

Jenny must have heard this too, but just continued with the massage. The other bloke left, and she called to the other girl to go into the third room where the third bloke had been patiently waiting all this time! Finally, she leant over and whispered if I would like a nude hj. I said yes, and she asked for $50. A bit expensive, but she was attractive and I was keen to see her naked, as she seemed to have a good figure. She then did something strange. She went over to a mirror that was hanging next to the door (which had a bolt to keep it from being opened from the outside) and turned it over. Naturally I asked why she did that, and she said because of the camera!! She then went out and turned the lights off and came back with a wet towel. She stripped her top off, revealing smaller breasts than I expected (obviously her bra had significant padding) and pulled her jeans and underwear down, to reveal a very nice smoothly shaved pussy. She handed the towel to me, obviously wanting me to wash my hands with it, so I did so, and then she started to masturbate me. 

Her technique was good, playing with both my cock and my balls, and I reached over and started playing with her tits. I then moved my hands further down and started playing with her pussy, but access wasn't good as she had only pulled her jeans down to her thighs, so I pulled them all the way down and she was able to spread her legs and give me better access. We played with each other, and it was fun watching her face as she smiled down at me, obviously enjoying the pleasure I was giving her as she was doing the same to me. All this time though, she was urging me to be quiet (even though it was obvious that the other ml had just wanked off her first client without any concern for the sound it made!) She then did another strange thing. She shuffled around, jeans around her ankles, and got her phone and then shuffled back. She appeared to be pointing it at my cock, and I thought she was about to take a picture(!), but instead she started a loud song playing. She then started the hj again, even more vigorously, and I realised the music was to mask the sound of her wanking me!! This was all pretty weird, but her hj was good and I was soon spurting all over her hands and my stomach.

She then got dressed, cleaned me up, and said the massage was over. I got dressed too, gave her the fifty and she showed me out the door. I gave a farewell in Indonesian, but again she didn't appear to understand.

Jenny works Friday and Sunday only (she said she works as a cleaner in a hotel on other days). This whole experience was strange, but certainly not unpleasant, and I intend to go back again and try to suss out exactly what the story is here, not to mention seeing how far Jenny will go!

Chas, thanks for review, FYI -Jenny is Philo, not Indonesian.

"She then got dressed, cleaned me up, and said the massage was over. I got dressed too, gave her the fifty and she showed me out the door. I gave a farewell in Indonesian, but again she didn't appear to understand"

Seen her there on a Friday also and at also at 106 Main in Blacktown, same routine. Tells you to be quiet, rushes the ending. She will do FS- but I would not recommend.
Cheers, DB

Thanks very much mate, that explains a lot. I wonder why she says that she's Indonesian then? So strange.

Yes mate, weird. 
Maybe it's done for privacy or marketing....I've seen the MLC girls try to say they're Japanese sometimes. 
I mentioned Jenny in my post on this place back in June 15. Then, she was telling the other shop girls she was Malay. Go figure... here's a link to the post:

Separately, you're a hero for all those great maps. Thanks and well done!

Thanks mate, but I apologise for not realising that there was a thread for this place already started by you. I did look but must have missed it. Perhaps the mods could merge them?

Value for money/recommend? : Not for me.

Was off to see a regular in Toongabbie but found out the last moment she was having the day off, so scout around for somewhere that I had not been before and this place popped up. 

Pretty easy to find, it is in a small arcade down the back into the right with the obligatory flashing open sign. Doorbell out the front, but the doors unlocked so I just pushed in to be greeted by two middle-age but reasonably well presented masseurs. The closest one to the door pops up flashing her bright smile at me and guiding me into the first available room.

She introduces herself as Jenny and asks if I have been here before, I am forever at a loss as to why this question is asked unless it is to flush out I that I am seeing someone else in the joint on a regular basis, who knows.

I disrobe and lie on the table as instructed, Jenny scoops up handfuls of axle grease consistency massage oil and generously applies it to my body, at this stage I feel like a piece of meat being prepared for a good roasting. As the massage proceeds it is clear that Jenny's second job is a bricklayer obvious why her course hands and great strength, axle grease aside it was one of the better massages that I've had. As we got closer to the prescribed time Jenny asks me whether I'm interested in a hand job, I agree and she quickly ups the anti by offering to disrobe during this task all inclusively for $50, I agree. Whilst on a roll she then asks if she can wrap her tongue around my old fella, hmm what's the price another $50, nope not interested at that price.

She disrobes at her body meets expectations (I did not have high expectations), but it's okay. She's very cautious about where hands go, nipples are sensitive but not out of bounds, as my hands go lower "not inside not inside", okay but that was not my intention. The delivery of the service was very mechanical to the point I started laughing she's a bit put off by this and asked her why, it wasn't fair to tell her. Anyway he had been long time since I had this type of massage things inevitably came to a conclusion.

Will I return: I don't think so, too much axle grease for one.

Really? She must have some Indian genes in there somewhere, I was going off appearances, next time I should ask.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Ellie from Westmead told me she now works here on Wednesdays, so popped in hoping to see her. Unfortunately someone had just gone in before me and taken her. May was the other girl on so thought why not. She is pretty with a nice set of boobs. Into the room and stripped. May gave a very good massage. Towards the end, started a more erotic massage, getting me hard. Turned over, and the usual tug signal, $20. Of course I said. She proceeded to give a nice, slow hj, lifting her top up so I could have a play with her boobs. Eventually sped up the pace until I came hard. Clean up and left satisfied. If Ellie is ever busy next time I go there, I would be happy to see May, although I don't think Ellie would like that.

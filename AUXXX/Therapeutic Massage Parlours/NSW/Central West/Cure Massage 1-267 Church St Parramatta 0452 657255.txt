My experience/comments : There's not a lot to say. It was a standard good massage in a mixture of Thai and Chinese styles, with hot rocks included, but completely legit. I was strategically covered by a towel at all times.

I arrived about 10:30am and I could hear another bloke already there in the room next to me (the walls don't go to the ceiling so you can hear even a whisper next door). Two other blokes arrived after me so it's a popular place. I didn't feel comfortable talking much as I knew everything I said would be heard by the other blokes, so I wasn't able to get much information from Angie.

I did hear one of the other blokes ask about their Wentworthville shop and, when I asked the receptionist about as I was leaving, a youngish Asian bloke who was sitting in a corner of the waiting area said it was in the one in the Wentworthville Mall. This surprised me, as that shop's a standard shopping centre, Chinese husband and wife, setup. The young bloke seemed to be the owner, or have some sort of controlling influence, as he was clearly monitoring what was going on. It was all a bit strange.

Good place for a reasonably priced legit massage though.

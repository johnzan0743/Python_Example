My experience/comments : Was on my way down to CL Health Massage at Meadowbank to see if Melisa was available, as a top massage (only) is always guaranteed.  Stopped off at Ermington to get a coffee and as luck would have it parked right in front of Siam Health Thai Massage.  Had never seen this place before and then guessed by the sign on the door it was a new opening.  Up the stairs and knocked on the door, answered by Wannisa who was very pleasant, attractive and all decked out in a traditional thai massage outfit.  Wannisa said the shop had only beeb opened for 3 weeks.  Thought to myself this will be a legit place with no extras (and I was right) but I do enjoy the thai attention so I opted for 90 minutes which was offered at the opening special of $85.
First had my feet washed in warm water, off the the gear (told to leave underwear on), then onto the table in an absolutely clean room and linen.  Started off Thia style and then on to the oil massage (covered with towel) which was damn good. Finished of with head massage and then some stretching before into the shower (brand new and very nice) before hitting the road, although I did tip Wannisa $15 as the 90 minutes was very enjoyable.  There would be no extras at Siam Health Massage, as is the case with Melisa down the road at CL Health Massage, but in both instances the massage from these 2 ladies is worthwhile.

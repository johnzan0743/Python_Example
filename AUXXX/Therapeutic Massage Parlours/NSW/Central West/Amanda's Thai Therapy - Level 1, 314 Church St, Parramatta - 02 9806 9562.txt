My experience/comments: I noticed this place had opened recently and was having opening specials with an hour's oil massage for $50 (until the end of May). At this price I thought it was worth a go! It's upstairs above a hairdresser in the restaurant end of Church Street in Parramatta, so there's just a single door at street level. Upstairs is fitted out quite nicely with around eight or more rooms. The rooms have floor to ceiling walls but only a (thick) curtain on the door. As I was about to enter I was preceded by an attractive Thai woman in her early forties and I followed her up the stairs. It turned out she was Amanda. She explained how they were having an opening special and took me down to a room at the end. Then Sweet came in and told me to undress but leave my underwear on (sigh).

Sweet lived up to her name. She was sweet and very easy to chat to and told me how she had come to Australia 2 years ago to attend business college, and worked here and at a market in Sydney. Her massage was above average, but not the best I've had, although she managed to be quite intimate even with my underwear on (nothing deliberate though). 

It's difficult to see how they'll compete with so many other Thai massage places in the immediate vicinity and places like Wei Kang 30 seconds up the road offering a better massage for cheaper (when they start charging full price).

I enjoyed the massage, but it left me incredibly horny so I then went around the corner for a certain wank at Parrathai Spa. But that's a separate review!

This place has been open for a long time and Amanda is actually Chinese.  There was a time when a HJ was a reasonable chance however they have gone legit.

She was the previous owner of Wei kang. Went there onve as having noticed a new massage shop and found she was the owner and she recognised me from wei kang. It is pricier than her former shop but if you like a nice setup and environment for a straight massage.

Ah, so she's just moved down the street (and gone a bit more upmarket).

Advert in the Parramatta Advertiser.

Basically a private apartment arrangement. After some confusion about street and flat numbers I arrived. Had been told that there are normally two girls but only one that night, a Sunday. Cost was $130 for one hour – sold as b2b massage with hj.

Well both mamasan and girl were very pleasant. Was not offered a shower before or after even though there would be one in the apartment. Girl was a nice chinese student type. She outlined the price and service and indicated that it was not full nude, she left her shorts on.

Massage was too soft but she had been trained and it was fairly pleasant. B2b consisted of her rubbing her body (breasts) over my back. Turn-over time resulted in a routine handjob – no encouragement of touching though. Head massage to finish.

Basically the price is way too high for what’s delivered compared with other 1 hour b2b. Having said that it was pleasant and had it cost $80 or so I would have been reasonably happy. Much more private than a lot of places and girl was good looking and nice to talk to.

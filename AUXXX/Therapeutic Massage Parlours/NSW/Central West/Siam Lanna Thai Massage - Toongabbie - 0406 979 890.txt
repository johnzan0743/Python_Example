My experience/comments: I'd noticed this please a couple of weeks ago and decided to try it when I had some time to spare. I wasn't sure of it would be legit or rnt but, of course, there's only one way to find out and so, having some time this morning, I decided to check it out and, if necessary, toftt.

It's opposite the station and, to gain entry, you have to ring a doorbell, which I considered a positive sign. I was greeted by an attractive late 20s Thai woman and, upon entering, I could see that the place was fitted out nicely with three large curtained massage areas (no walls) with large tables in each one. We discussed their various options and prices and I chose an hour long oil massage. There was a large sign on the reception counter saying not to ask for any sexual services but, of course, we all know that can just be for show. She took me to the first massage area and another, plainer, woman appeared from a door at the back. It turned out that she was the one who would massage me, rather than the first women, which was a little disappointing. 

The first woman told me to get undressed, but to leave my underwear on, so I knew straight away that I was unlikely to get more than massage.  While I got undressed and got onto the table the ml, whose name was Pat, went away to change into her massage outfit and when she came back I was pleased to see that she was wearing a very low cut top that revealed some great cleavage and showed off her quite large breasts nicely. My hopes went up a little!

Her massage was perfectly competent, if not exceptional, and she was careful to keep me strategically covered with a towel at all times. However, she moved my underwear as far out of the way as was possible and was quite intimate in massaging around my groin. Not enough to be called deliberate tackle tickle, but enough to make me wonder, and it certainly was pleasant enough to start me growing. I was wearing boxers that I can easily pop out of so when I turned over my semi-hard cock did indeed pop out. She would have clearly seen it and she seemed to delay a little in covering me with the towel. Her massage on my front was quite enjoyable as she concentrated on my lower half and so I was constantly provided with a very good view, down her gaping top, of her impressive tits. Once again she was as intimate as possible in my groin area, without it actually progressing to something that could be called tackle tickle, and when she was tucking the towel in between my legs her hands did seem to linger against my cock. My cock continued to harden and soon made a tent of the towel, however she didn't take it any further and I didn't want to push things, at least not on a first visit, so I let her continue with the massage without saying anything. 

This was a perfectly good, if not outstanding massage, at a slightly lower price than other Thai massage shops in the area, and would be worthwhile going back to. The premises are professional and inviting, and the hints I got made me just wonder if a regular customer might get more than just the massage, particularly since I was the only customer during the hour I was there so they don't appear to be busy.

Nice review Charles! The titillation in such sessions is always a turn-on... I'd reckon regularity might reap rewards here.. despite the mere curtain divisions. Definitely wouldn't be the first place to have fun amongst the drapes!

Thanks Charles for your efforts.

Have seen this place to and wondered.

Only problem is that it seems to me that you haven't been able to positively confirm what is or isn't on offer which probably means it will stay on my to do list. Think I would have made some comment on the changed outfit and the improved scenery. Funny how a bit of fun makes you have to go elsewhere and spend more to tame the beast

Hi Mabza,

I'm sorry if it wasn't clear, but my conclusion from one visit (and I plan to have more) is that this is essentially a legit place but has the potential for more with further visits. It would certainly be informative to see how someone else goes, so I encourage you to also tofft, as Wotan suggests. The massage alone is certainly good enough, particularly at the price.

Cheers,
Charles

Should have considered my post wording a bit more - regrets.

What I was getting at was that your visit didn't result in a goal, with an AFL slant maybe a behind was scored though. Your story suggested it was worth the visit, goal or no goal and hence why it stayed on my list.

Anyway had been planning on having some busty Thai as advertised in the Tele (Harris Park) but went to Toonie instead this morning.

Door was answered by a cute slight short Thai girl who I guessed was not to be my ML.  She was as it seemed the other taller girl had just arrived.  I didn't get to keep underwear on and instead was handed a set of grey pants, not shorts and if they had been blue I would have said Homer had left then there.

My ML called herself Tee (?) which was an abbreviation of her Thai name that I didn't catch and didn't ask her to repeat.  Tee does a great massage but there was no cleavage for me.  Massage was a Thai massage, Charles must have had the aroma oil massage which is the extra $20. Tee actually had me on my side, she did both sides, for various procedures, some which I had never experienced. Tee has strong hands and does a good massage.  I had the odd opportunity to touch her and there was no pull away and at one stage she had my arm stretched out towards her and my hand was on her boob - no reaction + or -. Anyway thought things may be picking up as Tee left the room for a minute and on return the flash of colour from the corner of eye while still face down suggested she had changed to a skirt on instead of the pink jeans she started with. This was not to be as she had changed in to pants, on the way out the girl at reception had an identical pair on.

Both Tee and the girl at the reception asked if I had been there before and I had lied saying yes, last year.  The girl at reception said her name was Vivienne and she told me that 5 girls worked there. She also suggested that if I had a sore back I should come every two weeks. As Charles said you just get a hint you could get luckier on return a visit.  Didn't think to ask Vivienne if I come back in two weeks could I cum then?

Great to see you toftt Mabza! 

Yes, you're correct, I always ask for the oil massage at a Thai place as I learnt years ago in Thailand that this offers the most likelihood for extras. In my experience they get you to wear the special baggy pants only for traditional Thai massage, and having these on reduces the potential for extras to pretty much zero. Traditional Thai massage can also be a bit brutal!

I suspect the cutie who answered the door is the same one who answered the door for me, so she is probably the owner/manager and most likely only massages when the other lady is already busy. You got good info finding out that they have five girls there - presumably they each work a different day of the week, I doubt they would get enough business to have more than two ladies there at one time, so Pat may only work Thursdays.

Your visit makes it clear they wish to at least appear completely legit and so any opportunities for extras would presumably only be likely if you establish yourself as a regular (and thus not some sort of undercover inspector).

I anticipate having an enjoyable time finding out!

A quick update. I returned today and saw Pat again. I arrived shortly after 10am and it was much busier than last time. Shortly after I arrived another bloke turned up who enquired about the prices, whilst I was sitting waiting to go into the booth, but then left. After I went into the booth I heard another bloke arrive, who seemed to be a regular, and Vivienne took him into the third booth at the end. Shortly after this, yet another bloke arrived and I heard Vivienne go out to him and tell him they were full and to come back in an hour. This confirms they only have the two ladies on (at least in the mornings anyway). It's also telling, I think, that everyone who turned up was male!

I undressed and left my underwear on, like last time, even though Vivienne said nothing about it, but I presumed that was because I'd been there before and should thus know the ropes. However when Pat came in to start the massage she seemed quite surprised that I had my underwear on, so next time I think I'll take them off and see what she says.

The massage itself proceeded the same as last time, but was even better if anything. 

The one occurrence of real note though, was that at one stage I heard the unmistakable slap, slap, slap of a vigorous wank coming from the other booth! This confirms my thinking that there is more on offer for regulars!

This morning Pat was "at school" so another lady, Tip, was filling in for her today. She is a tiny little nut brown lady who looks more Indonesian than Thai. She had no problem with me stripping off completely and her massage (which was awesome!) included plenty of quite intimate touching although never strayed to outright tackle tickle. Whilst she used a towel to cover me she wasn't overly careful with it and some of the positions she put my legs in would have revealed everything. Naturally on turnover there was quite a tent, but she was completely unconcerned and worked quite close to my dick although didn't actually touch it. Very pleased with this massage on every count!

I've continued to visit this place each week and it's become clear that, despite my initial impressions, there's nothing on offer apart from good value therapeutic massage. Well worth it for that though.

Have been meaning to post - I have also returned given the lure of forbidden fruit. Alas it seems to be a successful business strategy, leave an impression that things might get better for continued patronage but doesn't happen. I sensed with Vivienne that while she was friendly enough she kept her distance and there was this 'business' vibe. Maybe they have invested too much in the business to risk council intervention.
Not a good punting strategy for me though as the lack of fruit to be plucked means I end up going elsewhere to spend more money. Ends up costing $115 for 1.5 hours massage and having the boat tugged while having a bit of a grope - not happy Vivienne!
Have to ask - who is being exploited here?

My experience/comments: (Here you must have at least 1 full sentence - "Ill be back" or "good value" is not a sentence or review. 20 word minimum please):

So took one for the team and tried this place out the other day. Drove past it a couple and had called once and it seemed legit.

back was really playing up and Hope st was booked out so figured might as well.

Met the owner Coco who was with a client. 10 minutes later she showed me to an empty cublicle (low walls curtained off on 3 sides) while she escorted the previous client out.

moved into her cublicle (first one from the door) and even though it was close to closing time, she agreed to an hour. $50 and off with the clothes. 

The massage was the one of the most lacklustre ones i've had in some time. Think it was the end of the day and she wasn't up for a medium massage.

Anyway, after moving my skin around she got a hot towel ( i had to ask because she was asking me turn over without any tackle tickle) and then turn over time. 

She went straight into the hj and i was surprised but remembered mentioning a softer massage on my lower back due to th epain. She must have mistaken that for the rub 

well the rub was everything the massage wasn't. her silken hands felt great and she paced it really well. I didn;t ask about any nudity or attempted to touch her. her body language was saying hands off so i respected that.

The happy ending was achieved and i handed her a $20 as i got dressed. it was way past closing time now but there was another customer in the other booth. i asked to use the loo before i left and as i was coming out of the privy, the other WL came into the back area to grab a towel or wash her hands. 

i noticed her jeans top button and zipper were undone as she went back to her cubicle. two thoughts ranthrough my head then. 1. Nudity may be on the cards if requested. 2. The second WL is old and pretty rough looking. I'm thinking the customer needed the nudity to get over 

Either way, i chalk this up as taking one for the team. Doubt i'll be going back

6/10 (HJ savedthe day)

Hmmm tried it once and won't be back, even if you are going to get them to remove their gear you can't expect to do too much because you are seperated from the next booth by nothing but curtains that don't close to well at the front.  At least you might get some value for money if you want to get off on listening to what's happening next door !  Lots of hushed whispers and hand actions makes for no excitement for me I'm afraid and to top it off the massage was lack lustre at best. Give me Lalor park any day over this joint.

My experience/comments: I went to this establishment just to see if it was any different to the usuall quick hand job place. When I went to open the door I was met with a chain lock. Apparently I was supposed to stand outside on a busy street and wait to be let in.
A lady who was talking to an old chinese guy let me in. She asked me if I wanted a massage. I wasn't there for groceries!! She led me to a cubicle curtained off from 3 other cubicles. 
She gave me a soft massage for a short time and then came the usuall.
If you want hand job you give me tip.
That immediately put me off. I know I should expect it but it still rubs me the wrong way (pun intended).
All in all, a pretty average cheap venue with nothing to make me want to return.

My experience/comments : 

Was on the train out to Blacktown when I spotted this place out of the train window - thought I would take a gander after coming back into the city. The place is right on the main drag and the entrance is very public - might not be suited to all you shy types here. 

Met with a lady whose name now escapes me. She was petite and about mid 30s with A cups. Opted for a massage and see what happens. THe massage was ok and on the flip, massage my front with some accidental brushing on the front. I asked if there was any extas and she said what I was expecting. I said, how about a HJ - which set me back $20. Her HJ was pretty good and she was pretty eager to make me blow. I obligd and slimed her hands 

It was an ok experience, but nothing worth coming back for.

The SeaRay has to drive out to the Central West for a car inspection and is feeling like a RnT massage with a flabby & filthy old Mature Chinese may try CoCo as she sounds old & filthy for a tug.

I have been to this establishment a few times principally to see someone else who used to work there, but of late I've been dropping in to see Coco.

Coco is your typical MILF with a very happy demeanour and keen to please. Coco will only offer a clothed hand job, she is happy with a little bit of playful wandering which will sometimes yield small results but often not.

The quality of the massage is certainly worth the visit and the money that you pay for it, I have always found the quality and effort put into the finish is of superb quality, enough for me to happily return on a regular basis.

The SeaRay finally visited "CoCo Massage" shop as she has a $30 1/2 massage and was greeted by a Chinese M.L. who looked about 40 and had her hair in a sort of neat boob. I was expecting an old hag but she said she was CoCo. I gave her a $50 and she gave me back $20 and hoped onto the massage table. Halfway thru the massage with no tackle tickle, she put her hand on the back of my Balls and asked if I would like them massage for extra and as soon as I said yes, she started massaging my Bum Balls and Cock as I rose to my knees, then the flip. Although she didn't insert a finger into my Ginger, she was rubbing the outside with zeal whilst she pulled me off. After giving her back the $20 change, upon leaving, another quite attractive nerdy Chinese Lady with glasses and long black hair had been sitting out side and I would not mind going back to have her fiddle with my Piddle

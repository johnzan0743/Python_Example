Comments:
Stopped in this "newly opened" shop for a back rub and saw Tina, a slim, Chinese girl from Harbin. The shop is recessed inside a little strip mall near the rail station in Pendle Hill. Tina said she is 25 (maybe true, maybe 30+). While not pretty, she has a pleasant personality and a ready smile and laugh that I found attractive. Tina has good English, and gives a good massage. 
The place has walled rooms and curtains for doors, with easy parking across the street which parallels the RR tracks on the "city" side (west side) of RR tracks running thru Pendle Hill. I was 5 minutes away in the industrial area on east side of tracks when I called and I was glad to get Tina as there is also a Filipina there named Jenny on Fridays (who I've seen a few weeks prior with rather bad results ...I hope to write a proper review soon). 

Tina gave the type of FBM I was after, and seemed happy to let me constantly caress her, and with a little TT prior to the flip, she finished up with a nice 2 hand technique. I did not ask for or get offered a nude option, but with calibrated hands I can tell she has a slim little booty and I would guess "a" cups. Tina is easy to talk to and has been in Oz 5 years. She works Wed and Fridays and I would ask for her again when next in the area and time permits.

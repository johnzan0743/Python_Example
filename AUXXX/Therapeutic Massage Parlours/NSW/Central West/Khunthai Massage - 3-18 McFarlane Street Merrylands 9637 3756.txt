My experience/comments : Not much to report here I'm afraid. Strictly legit, undies on, girl in uniform, Thai massage. The massage was good, the room was large and so was the table. There are sliding doors on the rooms with no locks and during the massage I heard someone else looking in one of the drawers next to the table. I hadn't heard them come in so the doors are quite silent. This would make it pretty hard for a girl to provide sly hj if she wanted to since she could be interrupted at any time.

Anyway Oi was nice, we had a good chat and her massage was very good as well. A good place near Stockland Mall if you're doing some shopping and want a decent massage.

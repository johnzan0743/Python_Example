Comments 
Saw a Locanto ad for a new Parramatta MP; I called and spoke to the minder "George" listed in ad who said come right over. Greeted by a friendly, heavy set Thai receptionist named Natalie who showed me to the room and said another girl would be in soon. A very friendly and pretty Amanda walks in wearing professional style massage clothes, which hid her shape. 
Amanda proceeds with a nice, Swedish style massage, not too much lazy elbows and allows the light touches I give her allowing me to check the attitude on any extras that may be on offer. She speaks good English having been in Oz for 5 years and says it is her first day at this new shop, soon stating her verdict is still out if she will stay. She explains that she travels out west from the city because there is too much competition in the city from the younger, slimmer girls.

Some TT prior to the flip and negotiations follow, teasing me with a view of the cleavage on a massive rack. No FS available, but she was offering only the cashy CBD/Gold Coast prices for extras, but accept for the 50 nude handy and wanted 100 for the body slide. She is still clothed, while I'm foolishly thinking with the little head, and we get to 80 for the B2B body slide option (yep, no brains there, caveat emptor and I'm spoiling the market for what should be included in the $50 option). 

Unfortunately, her naked body disappoints, with significant excess Shar Pei birthing skin, but did I mention the natural DDs? Amanda used those mams to good advantage and they still looked great. Lots of Spanish service followed, with her supporting and squeezing her tits around my unit, which could almost disappear between those 1 litre jugs. I concentrated on that view, rather than the less appealing midsection. She did wriggle around a lot on top of me on the table, reversing in 69 style, making sexy faces and noises the whole time. Clean-up and more pleasant chat and goodbys. 

Good service from Amanda, but no real VFM  IMHO, as the negotiating and price left a bitter taste. While I'm always up for trying a new R&T shop, for comparison, some nearby brothels are offering great day time FS specials with good mid-20's talent that are hard to pass by for FS (i.e., half hours at: 45 George Granville- $70, 22 Brodie, Rydalmere -$65, 185 Military Guildford- $80). If I visit this shop again, I'd get the massage after a FS visit to allow more clear headed thinking!

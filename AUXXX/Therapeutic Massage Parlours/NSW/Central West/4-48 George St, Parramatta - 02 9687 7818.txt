Now working in Parramatta it's time to check out the RnT's and today I tried out this shop at 4/48 George Street located in an old building for a 1/2 hour massage for $30 and a $20 tug. Julie the M.L. did a quick rub with some tackle tickle then upon the turn over lifted her top to reveal a nice set of firm B Cuppers with no bra and after she allowed me to slide her pants down to reveal her shaven Cunt, not a bad $50 half hour RnT

"Busyboy" The M.L. was 37, a great body, slim, too much lipstick on, her Breasts are very firm, didn't really like me sucking her Nipples, I think RnT with happy ending is the majority of their business, pop in and try them out.

Hours of Business :  Don't know

Rates :   $30 half hour + tips

Age :   mid to late 40s

Size/shape :   Size 12

Nationality or Ethnicity :  Chinese

Services Provided : Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? :  Average

My experience/comments : 

After reading recent posts on this place I thought I would give it a try. I had a vague recollection of visiting a place around that spot on a Sunday morning 5+ years ago and indeed it was the same place. I walked in and I see the Boss who looked very familiar. She recognised me as well but if I have seen her somewhere else she wasn't letting on where. Her name was Betty.

Both ladies were busy so Betty said she would start the massage and another lady would come in and finish. After about 10 minutes Cindy comes in - slightly plump but friendly milf in her 40s. Massage was ok (Betty's was better) 
and just prior there was tackle tickle but it was brief. On turn over the usual gesture and nod and a clothed HJ followed.

Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad service it was just a bit mechanical. Usual $20 tip was given and I was on my way. I could come back to this shop if I am looking for a good cheap simple RNT. Otherwise there are plenty of other options around. Ladies are probably going to be a bit more mature, I saw the other girl on shift as I was leaving. Cheers.

The SeaRay now working in Parramatta had been building a weeks worth of Seaman with intention of fucking either a Asian MILF or Lady Boy in Merrylands or Guildford and by Lunchtime the urge was to great to bear and whilst walking past this well known dodgy Chinese Massage & Cock Pulling Joint could not resist the temptation for an old smelly hairy M.L.C. mature to play with my Penis, man it was terrific $40 for 45 minutes with left 15 minutes to grab a sandwich before heading back to the office was well worth the $40.... when she asked if I wanted hard of firm, I just said sexy and the tackle tickle started straight away and soon her huge heavy Breasts were pooping out of her Bra and her big thick nipples ended in my mouth but what was best was the tight thighs she was wearing were not so tight after all and soon her big round belly that had a massive C Scar separating the rolls of Chinese Fat revelled an increasable smelly hairy pussy into which I fingered her old loose hole, the smell of her old cunts was like what YoKo fries up for her Girls, there was no way I was going to sniff her or get close to her cunts, but the smell was quite exotic. Thank GOD she had a good hot towel to wash my fingers before I left to buy my Lunch.... this joint is cheap and nasty and just what Parramatta needs

The SeaRay loves this little Chinese RnT, popped in this Afternoon for a 30 minute $30 Massage and handed the MLC Mature $20 upfront and enjoyed a great Happy Start in which the MILF bared her Breasts and for an extra $20 she removed her Pants and Panties for the HJ then followed by a good 30 minutes of a great firm massage...

Person's Name : Susan

Establishment : Remedial Massage

Date of Visit : 02/10/16

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 4/48 George St Parramatta

Hours of Business : Don't know, but was open early on a Sunday

Rates : $30 half hour + tips

Age : Late 40s

Size/shape : Medium sized, Milfy lady

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Good

My experience/comments : 

Found myself in Parramatta early on a Sunday morning around 9:30. First tried Wendy's at 181 Church St but they weren't open yet. Thought of this place which has been a bit hit and miss for me, but worth a look. For those that don't know this place is in a small older style arcade in George St. Looks like the arcade does not open Sundays, but there was a sign out the front prompting customers to ring a door chime if they wanted a massage. I push the button and after a few seconds a lady comes out and opens the door, 'Massage?' she asks and shows me into the shop. I have to wait 10 minutes as both ladies are busy. But I have to say full marks to the Boss here- for the investment of a few dollars in a wireless door chime and turning up to work a little earlier she has pulled in a few customers she may not otherwise have got.

The lady who showed me in was Susan, a pleasant looking more mature lady from Fujian. Has kept in pretty good shape (maybe slightly bigger in the rear but only by asian standards, by western standards she is still trim). Anyway I think her massage is where she seems to know what she is doing. I went for medium and only a half hour, but from what I could tell maybe going for an hour and asking for a firm massage might be worth it next time. Susan was quite chatty as much as this place allowed (no sound proofing here- rooms with curtains and walls that don't go to the ceiling, basically 2-3 cubicles side by side).

I was sensing that Susan is quite experienced so I made sure I touched her leg a couple of times during the massage hoping she would get the hint. I wasn't disappointed, as unprompted she started the tackle tickle. On turn over a decent happy ending and I was on my way happy, making a note to try her hour massage next time. Forgot to ask what days she worked, but presumably Sunday is one of them. Not sure about if there were any other extras available, but got the impression maybe not. 

This shop is a decent option particularly if you are wanting a morning massage.

I visited here in June 2017.

It is a small shop with curtained off rooms. It is staffed with older Chines ladies. The day I was there there were three ladies. One was pretty. One was average the other looked a little like a dropped pie.

Lucky me. I was given the pretty one. Her name was Mary. Her English was not bad. She was short, slim and wore glasses (bonus!!!).

Her massage was good and on turnover signalled the usual. I signalled how much? $20 for a HJ. I nodded my head and smiled. Her HJ was good and she took off her top. Small breasts but nice nipples. She just kept feeding me her breasts and kept jerking away. I came. We hugged and kissed and I was cleaned up. I said my goodbyes and went back to the motel for a shower.

A good, cheap punt. Nice lady. Not a great looking store but good value, if you get the right lady. If you don't. Insist, or leave.

Now that I am working in Parramatta I would say this my favourite for a lunch time getaway.
There are normally 2 girls and the mamasan, I am old enough to find the mamasan sort of cute and she gives the best massage.
I would say the place is not what it looks like and is pretty consistent.
I find the curtained rooms a bit exciting.
Angela is on Monday and Wednesday and does great TT.
I do the $40 for 45min with the $50 option

Person's Name : Sassie
Establishment : Remedial Massage

Date of Visit : 15 Jan 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 4/48 George St Parramatta

Hours of Business : 10am to 7 (?) – as above arcarde is closed on Sundays but the owner seems to let someone else run it over the week end and you need to ring on Sunday to be let in

Rates : Cheap $40 for 45 minutes

Age : Hard to say – mid 30s

Size/shape : Medium with a bit more bust

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage + more

Value for money/recommend? : Good

My experience/comments : 

Hard to find secure time to sit at a PC and write a review ...

Would recommend this place. Looks are deceiving, from the outside looks like an older style traditional shop. Inside you have 3 stalls with curtain access from the corridor. The mamasan does do massage and she has the slightly larger stall at the back.

I eventually tried this place some time ago, with not too much expectation. It was a Friday and had a large lady who worked up to some excellent tackle tickle and ended up with a glad wrap BJ (GWBJ). Since that day I have routinely taken my own protection (BYOC).

I went on a Monday where there is a girl called Angela normally on. Angela is a bit of a fire cracker. Anyway, Angela was busy and ended up with Sassie who is a bit older.
It may be more for the return customer but the girls here give a massage bordering on a GFE. What I mean is the suggestive touches from the start. The girls here, in my opinion give excellent TT and don’t mind the roving hands.

There is the usual warm towel wipe down to soak a few minutes but this period can also be quite exciting – what to next? With wipe down completed I tend to make my expectations a bit clearer. I like to sit up to watch the lady under and I will retrieve my protection and whisper in her ear exactly what I have in mind
Next is CBJ and FS in various positions. It is funny that the lady will not want you to make too much noise and I always thought that was because of the boss. But having dome exactly the same thing with the boss the concern about the noise is other punters and they do get mixed clientele. The difference with the mamasan is that she gives an even better massage but you won’t get her naked as she has to be ready for walk ins

You will get a nice scalp massage to finish but having brought your own - you will have to also take it with you and put it in a bin far away

It is not set up with luxurious rooms, privacy and showers, but for the money this shop must be up there

Date of Visit : 10/11/18

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 4/48 George St Parramatta

Hours of Business : Not sure, probably the usual 10am to 7/8 pm

Rates : $30 half hour, $40 45 min, $50 hour

Age : 40s

Size/shape : Size 12, plain but friendly

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, friendly service

My experience/comments : 

Every time I come here the mamasan pokes her head around the corner and says "long time no see". She is usually right as there are long gaps between visits. This joint must be one of the last with the $30 half/ $50 hr prices so excellent value for money. Downside is the rooms have little privacy as they are crammed next to each other, have curtains for doors and walls do not go to the ceiling. But nice if you want cheap and cheerful.

Sasa's massage was not bad, and she pretty much went into the tackle tickle without prompting so light extras seem to be the norm here. She also 'accidentally' pushed her boobs against my hand when she was massaging my hands before the turn over. Maybe due to the shop setup I have never asked for more than a clothed HJ here and today was no exception. Sasa delivered a slow unrushed HJ with plenty of eye contact and encouragement. 

There is a nail salon which trades on Saturday right next door to this shop, so a tip is you can enter the arcade from the rear laneway which means you don't need to walk past the nail salon entrance. Cheers.

My experience/comments :.

Had some time to kill before my first meeting, so decided to pop in at bout 930am. The door was open and there was 3 ladies on- the mamasan and 2 ladies.

Shown into the middle cubicle and dealt with the finances for 1 hr.  Stripped and onto the table.

The massage was not bad, plenty of tickle tackle and teasing of the sack. During the massage, a dude came in and was treated by the mamasan. The dude sounded indian and a regular, judging from thw conversation. He was complaining about tightness and the mamasan was massaging the area, using tiger balm oibtment. 

Turned over and negotiated for a nude hj. She warned me the keep quiet because of the dude in the next cubicle. She gave some b2b before giving a pretty decent hj. The indian dude left just as the tadpoles were being released.

A quick clean up, and a head and hand massage to finish off

Dell Street at West Guildford is littered with Asian and Italian food shops, cafes, burger shops, fish and chips and a party shop. The pastry and gelato shops are worth a visit. After a bite and a coffee I noticed that at the end of the row of shops is a massage place. I headed over for a closer inspection.

On the outside the place looks like a so called legit massage shop it is quiet and reasonably discreet. The signage on the outside read "Healthy Body Massage". The shopfront has (02) 9632 9363 as a phone number but I think this may be the previous shop's phone number.

The door was slightly open so I made my way inside. As I entered I was greeted by an Asian MILF. She is slim, long jet black hair, small tits, early to mid forties. She smiled and seemed glad to see me. She was wearing that obligatory navy blue lab coat that legit massage joints tend to use. I reckon she didn't have much on underneath - probably a black G-string and lacey see thru bra.

There seemed to be only one room and a massage table. Place looked relatively clean and recently painted. The obligatory poster of a male with acupressure points was pinned to the wall. I asked for a 30min massage. Other services are on offer but on this occasion I settled for hand relief for an additional $20. This shop has only recently opened and business must be slow so this MILF will do anything for a fistful of dollars.

The massage was firm and good and she managed to remove all the knots. I was relaxed and ready for the ending.
As for the tug it was a bit bland and loose and so I gave her some instructions to get me across the line. I says to her - with your left hand grab the warrior by its throat and with the palm of your right hand, in a clockwise direction begin to vigorously polish the helmet. She followed the instructions to a tee and before too long I let loose and exploded. 
Trying to contain the load she cupped her right hand and covered the head of the warrior of love but left it too late - there was spillage and plenty of it. She had that surprised "fuck me!!" expression on her face and exclaimed "too much...too much!". As I grinned I gave her a wink and patted her on the arse for a good job. She cleaned me up and I was on my way.

Yes. 

Dell St sits between Woodpark Rd, Vivienne St and Fiona St. There is council park directly opposite to the shops.

Age : 50's

Size/shape : Painfully thin

My experience/comments : I discovered this place from their ad on Cracker and so wanted to check it out. It's located in a very small local shopping centre and parking is easy right in front. Inside, it is quite large with three rooms that have doors, but the walls go nowhere near the ceiling. The fit-out looks very new so this shop clearly hasn't been here very long (and google maps shows it used to be a Sara Lee Factory Outlet).

I arrived about 10:30am and was greeted by Coco, a painfully thin lady who may have been attractive once but is so gaunt she looks cadaverous now. Their didn't appear to be anyone else available so I let her take me into one of the rooms. I took the half hour option and she told me to get undressed and left to get change of the fifty I gave her. While I was getting undressed I could hear noises from the room next door, with giggling from what sounded like a much younger woman. I laid down on the table and Coco came back with the change and started the massage, beginning by basting me liberally in baby oil. Her massage was extremely ordinary, more just rubbing her hands over my body, although when she moved to my legs there was plenty of quite skilful tackle tickle. 

Shortly after she started my massage another punter came into the shop, so she went out to greet him and told him the other lady was almost finished. She indeed finished very shortly after that and so he went into the other room after the previous punter left. Coco was very talkative and wanted to know everything about me, which was a little disconcerting given that it was clear the punter next door could hear everything that was said with ease. I replied with as short answers as possible! While she was massaging me another punter called on the phone and said he would be there in about ten minutes. A busy place!

On turnover she gave the usual sign asking if I wanted a hj, and I nodded yes. She indicated $20 and I confirmed my agreement. I didn't ask her about getting nude as I had no particular desire to see her ancient waif-like body. She started with a reasonable tug and also sucking, and then biting, one of my nipples (but not too hard). I ran a hand up her leg to see if a bit of pussy play might be allowed, but discovered she was wearing some sort of plastic frilly panties(!) so I retreated. Her hj was skilled enough and so I soon got over the line. She cleaned me up with a hot towel, both front and back, and as I was leaving gave me a hug and said she only works on Mondays, so I should make sure I come back on a Monday.

I may go back again, but not on a Monday!

I think it's still worth a visit uncle, to see if any of the other ladies are better. I'd be interested in your experience as a comparison.

Sup People,

So I saw this place driving along, looked new - or at the very least, never noticed it before on Newbridge.

 							Person's Name: Honestly NFI - Yin Yin or something, I can never understand through the accent, sorry. 

Contact Details/Address: In the title, plenty of parking on Rickard road - really quiet side stress. Also a servo next door, good for cash from the ATM. Only downside is the road is super busy in peak hour and there are bright lights out the front. It's not very discrete. 

Hours of Business: Open 7 days. 9am - 10pm. Yep - 10pm! That's the latest time you'll find for anywhere in the Liverpool

Prices: This is where things suck - it's $80 for an hour, $50 for 30 mins. Tug was an extra $40.

Age: Bit confusing - lady who did the massage was older, girl who gave me the tug was younger, maybe mid 20's. 

Size/shape: Meh, irrelevant in the massage bit. For the tug, younger, tight, but clothed - couldn't really tell.

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai.

Services: RnT - other than that not sure.

Value for money/recommend?: New place, may get better - but it is pricey for what it is. $80 is pretty standard fair for 20 mins FS around the corner. Depends on what you want I guess. 

My experience/comments:

Anyway, wondered into this place. Parking was easy either side of the road - although crossing over would be tricky in peak hour, pretty busy road. The lady at the front took my dosh, lead me through. Place looks pretty bad. Sort of half done work, no actual rooms, but curtained off sections within rooms. There were also gaps in the curtains where I was, so I could see other punters heading in/out to other sections and they could (sigh) probably see me also ... ick. Surroundings not ideal - there's a common basin where the other girls went to get hot towels, so my ML kept chattering away on and off, and it was distracting.  

The tables look new and there's a fresh clean towel, rather than paper tower and plastic - which is nice. They're also leather, but stiff, so a bit uncomfortable in some ways, but also comfortable in another. Wide and broad too, for us heavier fellows ... one cool thing I've never seen, is that the tables here have a hole for your junk. Yeah, that's right, a big ass hole in the middle of table so when you lay down your cock flops through and doesn't get squished. Actually felt quite good - although conversely, when you roll over, your ass hangs out and that feels quite weird. 

Anywho - decent massage, the older lady was quite good. Very thorough, genuine massage that felt very relaxing and, had the setting been nicer (like in a Spa or something) would probably be what you'd expect for $80. At the front desk there's an official looking piece of paper that says at least one of them has a degree in massage - so maybe I got that lady? I dunno. Towards the end hot towel down, and the old 'happy ending' question. At that point a different girl came in. She was much younger and prettier, tight body. But - wanted $40. That's a bit stiff, but I was like wtf, try the place out - maybe there's something special to it. Sadly, no. Her technique was quite good, very patient, slow, no rush etc - enjoyable, no doubt, but not worth $40 when that would normally get topless, nude or sometimes even a BJ (see Shirley, 62A Moore Street). On top of that, both the girls I saw wore clothing that didn't look easy to change in or out of ... suggesting that extras are either going to cost a fortune, or just aren't on the table. I always love seeing a slutty dressed ML, cause you know she's popping her boobs in and out all day, 

All in all, a pretty disappointing punt. The ladies were very nice and friendly, and the actual massage table/towels were clean, soft and new, but the building, location and general surrounds just didn't match up to the asking price IMO ... not when you can follow the same road in either direction for about 10 minutes, and find the same service, with the same hot young girls, for about half the cost with double the extras.

Still - perhaps it's just early days and they'll learn to adapt to the other places around them. :P 

Cheers,

Jim

Thanks for the comprehensive review, I'd been wondering about this place whenever I drive past but haven't ventured in as I'm relatively local.

drove over to FS place at kelso moorebank, came in saw a really old ugly asian lady asked for price was $75 for 30mins said i will go to my car to get it, drove home. quite disappointing night.

@Hyperguy55: Heya man, there's a few places up the road from this. I can't speak for all of them, but I've stumbled through Unit 47, Numer 5 Kelso Crescent Moorebank once or twice before. If you keep following Newbridge Road for another 5 mins or so after that, you'll hit Liverpool proper - and from there, well, there's a lot of places; Rio, Angels, Casablanco and so on - although I've never tried any of them, so I can't speak to their quality. Go in the opposite direction (towards Bankstown) for about 5 minutes and you'll hit Cottan & Excelsior Avenue - pretty sure there's a 24/7 place in there some place.

@Jude99: I noticed that they have a mobile number, not a fixed line. Makes me think this will be one of those places that will be 'closed' from time to time, because the 1 x ML is busy with a client. Supposed to be open until 10pm every night ... but then, it probably won't happen on quite nights. Sorry to hear about your disappointing punt.

Arrived just after 5pm entered and was greeted by 2 ML's One older but looked quite attractive the other younger (May). Paid up front for massage. Massage was good but used a bit too much oil. About a 6/10.
A bit of tackle tickle while lying down. On turn over proceeded with massage and little more tackle tickle then asked if I wanted extras. Paid and convinced her to strip. Touching allowed but limited down below, enjoyed having her nips sucked and started to get wet. She got me over the line but the tug was very poor. Needs more guidance in this area. Tug 5/10. Over all and average experience.

 Date of Visit: 28 September 2013

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink: Parking available on side street but the man road is busy and very public.

 Hours of Business: 10am - 9pm

 Rates: $50 1/2 hour

 Age:24 (same age as the last girl)

 Size/shape: 10 - A cup (quite attractive)

 Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai

 Services Provided: massage offered happy ending

 Value for money/recommend?: No

 My experience/comments: Not with Ling

Was a bit pushed for time opted for 1/2 hour. Surprised when asked for $50 prices must have gone back up last time might have been an opening special.
The massage wasn't bad 6/10 and went for the full 1/2 hour, on turn over ask if I want HE I ask how much she quoted $40 & I asked does that include the strip her reply was no and no touching.
I don't have an issue with the HJ only but not at $40 total of Massage & H/E $90 could get FS for that. I declined the offer she justified her claim saying the 1/2 hour was up. I no problems but and no thanks. She seemed very peeved and surprised I turned her down. Jimmy you were right they charge premium prices for an ordinary massage. There is an older M/S lady there I would like to try her out her massage may be worth while. Happy to pay good money for a good massage HE or not. But I want my moneys worth. Ling works Saturday thru to Tuesday.

Regards

Will

 Age: Early 40's
 Size/shape: 10 - c cup older with a good body

 Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai

 Services Provided: massage 

 Value for money/recommend?: No

 My experience/comments: 

 Went back to try the older massage lady who also appears to be manager opted for 1/2 hour. $50 as per last time. The massage wasn't as good as Ling 4/10 but went for the full 1/2 hour. A bit surprised that she patted down my back and declared she has finished no turn over or HE. I enquired about a happy ending and she reply she doesn't do that which I accepted (disappointed) that's the risk and joys of punting. The downside was the massage was ordinary. I don't think I will be returning and I would be surprised if they last too long at the prices they charge and location isn't the easiest to get to especially in traffic

My experience/comments: Expensive for the quality

Was looking for good massage with happy ending in and around liverpool - found this place.
Booked for an hour oil massage, two girls on arrival - younger girl may offered to do massage other ML - in 40's and not attractive.
May is mid 20's pleasant personality, average massage skills. Turn over in 30 min and indicated with universal HJ sign - yes please. Negotiated for $50 for top off. Did not like to be touched below. Average HJ technique, did manage to get me over the line.
Overall average exp given the price - likely to get much better service if travelled further....

Hours of Business: 10am - 9pm

Rates: $50 1/2 hour massage plus $60 for full service

Massage Lady - Early 40s, size 6, A/B cups, remained fully clothed; 
Cindy - Mid to late 20s, dark complexion, size 16+, excellent D tits with very large dark nipples

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai

Services Provided: massage and separate HJ, CBJ, full service (eventually)

Value for money/recommend?: Haven't really made up my mind. With nearly an hour spent in the place it probably wasn't bad value for money, but I don't think I'll be back.

My experience/comments: 

I have driven past this place dozens of times, but today I decided to stop. 

I had read the less than enthusiastic reviews, but curiosity got the better of me. Anyway, sometimes it is better to go in with low to no expectations!

Opening the very exposed sliding door I walked into a spacious reception area. The whole atmosphere would have been very peaceful if it were not for the din of the passing traffic, which remained obvious all through the session. An attractive very slim Thai lady in her 40s, wearing striking tight yellow pants, asked if I wanted an hour for $80 or half for $50. I chose a half hour.

She led me though to a spacious and quite professional massage room where Chinese music was playing in a futile attempt to drown out the noise of the traffic. In the centre of the room was a two-hole table, although the middle hole was covered by a towel, somewhat defeating the purpose. She told me to take off my clothes and lie down, then she left the room. Although her English was good, she was far from chatty.

When she came back the massage commenced with cleaning of my feet with a damp towel. This was odd but also quite nice, although she did manage to tickle me a few times. Fortunately I did not kick her! What followed was a competent and enjoyable massage with a towel on my back, only folded back to reveal the area she was working on. At the beginning she "walked" down my lower legs, then upper legs, then back with her arms while she was kneeling on me (she was very light - I could barely feel her). This was followed by a  fairly soft oil massage. 

As nice as this was, I wasn't getting any vibe that even an HJ would be on offer. This was confirmed at the half hour point when she simply said "Okay, we're finished", without even a rollover.

As my expectations had already been set I wasn't terribly disappointed and I was about to sit up when she said, almost as an afterthought, "Do you want happy ending?" "Yes" I beamed, and rolled over. She quickly added "I have other worker". Huh? "How much?" I asked. "You'll have to ask other girl", said anonymous massage-only lady.

Other Girl arrived after a minute or two. She was also Thai, shorter, younger and stockier than lady no.1, and of darker complexion. I could see her busty figure quite well under her suburban clothing. Here name was Cindy.

Negotiations were not promising. "$40 for hand job". Bit expensive I thought. "How about $40 for hand job and you take off your clothes?" "No, $60 for take off clothes". "Do you suck cock" I asked. "No, I'm no good at suck cock" she replied cryptically. At this stage I was thinking that $110 for a nude hand job was really too much so I told her not to worry and got up to leave. "No, no" she said, "You stay. $40 nude and HJ".

Cindy peeled off her jeans and top to reveal a trimmed pussy and wonderful set of big firm D cup tits topped with large dark nipples. Bonus! Without further ado she started to oil me up and wank me. Not much in the way of technique but not bad. She did not mind me stroking her tits and actually seemed to be offering me her arse for access to her pussy. She asked me something, which I had to ask her to repeat a few times but eventually worked out that she was saying "Do you want sex?" "How much?" I asked, bracing myself. "$60" "$60 total?" I asked. Yup. Okay, pretty cheap upgrade, so I said yes.

"You use a condom?" she asked, indicating that this might be optional for her. "Yes please" I replied. "You want me to suck first?" She started with a decent covered blow job. Despite her earlier protestations several times that she was no good at sucking, she went deep throat almost from the first stroke. 

I then lay Cindy across the table, which was the perfect height for me to stand flat on my feet and penetrate her nice tight pussy.The view was fantastic, watching those big tits bouncing around as my cock slid in and out of her. She seemed to be enjoying it. 

The condom was doing its evil deflating work though, so I eventually asked Cindy to finish me by hand. She did so with lots of oil and not much imagination, but it did the job.

This was not the worst experience I have had by far, but it was a bit odd on a number of counts. The tag team situation was strange. Cindy seemed like a bit of a princess, and came across a few times as grudging. Maybe I'm just better suited to the Chinese and Caucasian establishments. 

Still, happy to chalk it up as a different experience!

Great review hyperguy. BTW, the cleaning of the feet is quite common in legit Thai places.

My experience/comments : 

Popped in week before last. Jenny (I think) was my ml and gave a lovely massage. asked me about extras early in the game. HJ was 30, and she wasnt up for nude. I agreed on the 30, and this woman was a firecraker. Great handjob and had her tits out and pants on the floor, while letting my rub her pussy and ass through her little gstring. The nude would definitely be on for my next visit, considering she might as well have been. 

Will go back for sure

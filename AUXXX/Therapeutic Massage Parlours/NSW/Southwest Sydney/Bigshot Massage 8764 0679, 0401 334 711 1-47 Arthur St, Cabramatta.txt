Comments:

Strolling thru Cabramatta I saw a shop I wanted to try if only for the name "Big Shot Massage". I hoped that just after a prior session I had enough left to live up to the name. I called the number to check availability and later walked up the stairs to be greeted by an experienced mama-san who assigned and introduced "Cindy" to me (nice touch to see your girl first to get approval). She looked good, so I paid the toll and was shown to a large room with walls to the ceiling and a proper door.

Onto the table, draped the towel across my rump and Cindy soon came back in, dressed for success in a sheer little silky short cocktail dress looking more like a date than a ML. She also looked experienced, clearly older than the 27 summers she claimed, but still quite pretty and wearing a form fitting dress to good advantage. 
A passable, but forgettable massage followed, and she seemed just fine with my caresses on her bare legs and across her silky dress. Clearly she knew this as a preamble to the better tipping to follow. Some TT, followed by the well rehearsed whispers and my favourite Mandarin phrase, "turn over darling".

Alas, no FS was available, but a nude and limited B2B slide was painlessly negotiated for the standard 50 with a happy ending skilfully delivered. Wet towels and cleaning, limited but friendly chatting and I said goodbye. 
Mama-san had a keen sense for marketing, attempting an immediate customer feedback survey and even asked me for my number for future notices of new girls. Nope, thanks anyway, but I don't do. Warning for the security conscious: This shop will call, text and send pictures- repeatedly. I make a point to call the land lines, but would recommend you go to private mode on your outbound calls for this one if you're concerned for your privacy.

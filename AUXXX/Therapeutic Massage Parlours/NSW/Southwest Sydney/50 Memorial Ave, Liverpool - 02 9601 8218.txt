So,

I'm stuck in Liverpool with a couple of hours to kill on a hot afternoon. Taking a wander around I see the massage sign leading upstairs, I take short dart into the entrance and at the top of the stairs is locked door with bell. Answered quickly by single Asian Girl, quire tall tall strongly built says her name is Rebecca, leads me into one of the many rooms, how long do  I want? 1/2 for $35 and an hr for $50, as I said time to kill so an hour it is. Lots of the reflexology posters and NO SEX signs that hints at seriousness, and there followed a very through massage deep into all my vertebrae! After around 50mins I'm asked to turn over, and straight to the point, asked "you want happy ending" well who am I to refuse I request that at least the top comes off, "top off $25" she replies, nice cranking action to completion then head (on shoulders type) massage to finish.
So another real massage with a little extra for those who are in the mood.

If mods want to move this to a better location, please do

Why would we want to move it? You've placed it perfectly and informed us of a hitherto unknown (on this forum) massage parlour.

Brilliant.

s.o.o.

im sure this is the place that has "no sex" sign on the back of the door, however handwritten underneath states "otherwise you take responsibility".

experience:

was feeling frisky so i decided to try out a place i havne't tried before in liverpool, saw this place looked suss but went against my gut feeling anyway, its in  a door way that leads up to a set of stairs. rang the door bell and it was really dark, someone came ot the door and it was still dark asked for massag ethe prices said $30/30mins i stupidly gave her the money without see her, then she turns on the light... oh god what a mistake that lady was like 60 years old at least old skinny and very ugly.

if i had given her the money which she tricked me into i would have bolted. anyway went into the next room and i swear she lives here all her stuff is here with personal photos and all could tell she was vietnamese by the writing on the posters and calendars. anyway this place is like dirty told me to take off my clothes but i reluctantly did so but left on my undies.

had the worst massage of my life this lady is angry about something because all she was doing was pushing me with all her weight even worst when she got to my arms she was gripping it so that her nails was digging into me.. i had to tell her to stop it was really bad that when i got home i realised it had actually cut my skin and there were these marks all over my arm i took out the dentol and sanitised it like hell.... 

anyway at the end she was talking to me about my bad back whihc i know and that i should come to her again so she could fix it (... yeah right) she also was telling me other massage places around here are bad and that you should not go to them because they are not massage places they do something else... i'm pretty sure she provides extra but i didn't want to go there at all.. also she was wearing a coat i'm pretty sure she wasn't wearing anything underneath..

as soon as the session was done i put on my clothes and ran away from there.. eventually want to 173 bigge st to wash that experience from my mind.

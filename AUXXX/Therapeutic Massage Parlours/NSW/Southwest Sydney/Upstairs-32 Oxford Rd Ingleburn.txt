I remembered seeing this establishment on a previous visit to Ingleburn so I thought I would try it out.(Apologies for not providing contact details as I just walked in off the street).
Walked up the stairs and into a very small suite to find no-one there but then a chubby asian lady appeared behind me and asked if I wanted a massage.I almost walked because she didn't look like much fun but I decided to take a chance and stayed.I paid my $35,got nude and assumed the position.The massage was quite good and after some teasing I turned myself over.I was offered a tug and asked how much I wanted to pay-$20 I replied and she accepted.Eva is a larger girl but has the curves in all the right places.She was wearing a short summer dress which allowed great access to her ass,which I enjoyed for the remainder of the session.She was quite shy and wouldn't turn around to show it to me but was quite tolerant of my wandering hand.I think with a longer session I may possibly have got further with her but time was not on my side this day.The tug was good,Eva is a nice lady and the session was cheap.If you like skinny asian girls you won't like Eva but if you like them chunky she's worth checking out.I would like a follow up session with her to see if her shyness can be overcome...

Hey team, has anyone tried this shop as yet, I was walking through the arcade the other day and noticed it, I didn't have time to stop but I do like an adventure so when I have time I will try it.
I thought I might ask first anyway to see if anyone has been there. The address is shop 8/ 247 George St, Liverpool it is in the arcade and called Liverpool chinese therapy and herbs.
I will probably give it a go next week, cheers

Well I went to this place today Wednesday 1/4/15 April fools day and I was the fool lol,, one for the team, bugger. The cost Sophia wanted was $80.00 per hour, I got her down to $60.00 she was the only lady there. After I give her the money up front she leads me into this tiny room with walls 3/4 the way up to the ceiling asks me to get undressed and she will return. I get naked and she comes back in, no cover up I am thinking I might have got lucky here. But no, it was only therapeutic massage and the worse massage I have ever had, what a waste of $60,00 bucks. NO tackle tickle, no turn over just an oil rub softly into the skin not impressed, she then wipes the oil off with a damp cloth and I am outa there. She had no personality and I did try to be nice to her hoping it might help the situation but that also was wasted. For those who want to know Sophia is about 40ish, chinese with ok body nothing to write home about. But honestly I would not waste my money or time even if you wanted just a therapeutic massage. So that made my day NOT lol. Cheers

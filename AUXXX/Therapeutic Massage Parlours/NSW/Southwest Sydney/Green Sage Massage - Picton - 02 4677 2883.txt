My experience/comments : 
This was my first visit, I think it is pretty new, so I thought I would give it a go, went in and saw Anna, Chinese I thought this is promising, usual go into the room, with a door but walls aren't all the way to the ceiling. I strip of to see what happens. Anna comes in and throws a towel over straight away. Bugger lol. But a really good massage I must say, no tackle tickle what so ever. On the flip she left the room and came back in with the towel still over the old fella. No chance of any HJ here I don't believe but if you want a really good decent massage this is the place to go.In summary: location is convenient and next door to bendigo Bank

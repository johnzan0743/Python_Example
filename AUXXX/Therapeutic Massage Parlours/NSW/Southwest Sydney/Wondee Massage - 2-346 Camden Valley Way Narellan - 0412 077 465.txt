My experience/comments : Hadn't see any reviews from here so thought I would TOFTT. Stopped in and Nat (who is the owner/manager or similar of the place) was available so I paid for the 1hr oil massage. On the front desk/counter near the price list is a sign saying no Sexual offerings (also on the wall in the room). The place is nicely set up and gives the feeling of a Traditional Thai Spa. Into the room and asked toe disrobe and get on the bed, there was a towel there but I put it to one side. Nat came in and put the towel across my back and proceeded to work me over with a decent Thai/Oil massage with absolutely nothing beyond the massage. She held up the towel for the flip and made sure it covered me up before working on my legs, shoulders, etc. At not point in time was there anything beyond a Massage happening. The walls of the rooms don't go all the way to the ceiling and I could here clearly the massage happening in the other room (there was soft background music as well as a fountain) and nothing extra happened there as well. If you are a fan of the Thai Oil massage then this is the place for you, but I got no feelings of anything extra at this stage. 2 people came in for massages while I was there and were turned away, so only 2 girls working, she was friendly and mentioned I should book in future if I wanted a massage, I was simply lucky to get in today.

I can also confirm this is a legit massage joint. Nothing suspect when I had a massage here. I even claimed private health care rebate

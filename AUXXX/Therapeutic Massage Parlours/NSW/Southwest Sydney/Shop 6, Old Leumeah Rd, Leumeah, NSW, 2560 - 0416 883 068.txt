My experience/comments : 

Was in the area for other reasons and decided to look up backpages to see if there's anything to make my trip worthwhile afterwards. Stumbled upon this ad and the place looked fairly new so I decided to give it a try. 

The shop is located at the end of a bunch of doctors and physio clinics across from campbelltown stadium. When i popped in i first saw the male owner and he told one of the girls next to him to attend to me. Yumi as i later found out her name is quite a small asian lady, i would say no more than 150cm tall. She had a thick jumper on and tight jeans. 

Anyway into the massage and i thought it was going to be a crap time, being such of small stature i could tell she was struggling at the start however then she started to put her whole weight into every movement and the massage got a lot better. It was pretty decent however i think it went for only 20mins until she told me to turn around, while tickling my balls. i turned around and she offered hj nude for $50, which i accepted. Yumi took off her top and reveal a marvelous set of fake tits. 

she liked to tease at the start with stroking and licking the nipples and then on to dfk. she had no issues with me playing with her pussy and it was really wet. her hj technique is great and she did not rush me at anytime. 

Also to note this place does not have hot towels.. there is no sink inside this parlor so i was only wiped down with tissues. Surprisingly though Yumis hygiene given this was quite good, so i'm not sure if she goes to the bathroom later to clean herself off.  

All in all, if i was ever in the area again i might visit it again. Its been the best experience i've had around her for a while especially the 2 new other places that opened in recent months being real duds (the ones at glenfield and minto). Yumi says she works sunday to wednesday.

[COLOR=#000000]  [/COLOR][COLOR=#3E3E3E]Been twice this is the account of my second visit. Walked in shown to a room told to strip no mention of keeping on undies. Girl comes in and gets into the massage. Friendly enough but doesn’t say much. The massage overall was ok but she spent too much time on my back and not enough on my legs. At times the back massage was good if a little repetitive and lacked variety. On turn over proceeds to massage the front as the old fella gradually comes to life. On the face down part of the massage there was no tackle tickle at all. Once he is at attention she offers a hand job I accept no discussion of money. She does a good HJ lets a little touch but no strip. At completion I give her $30 she then says it is $50 I pay her the additional $20 but it wasn’t worth the extra. Massage 5/10, HJ 5/10 Looks 6/10.[/COLOR]

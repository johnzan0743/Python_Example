My experience/comments:

Saw this new shop advertised on crackers a couple of months back and was in the area last month, found out no reviews has been made, so TOFTT!
The shop is conveniently located right across the train station, the entrance is highly exposed and I don't think there's any rare entrance, but I just head down and walked in.
the shop is quite spacious and there're three partitioned rooms which the wall go only about half way up to the ceiling (very high ceiling and low partitioned wall), the shop is clean and tidy.
Took the one hour option, paid and Suki came in and proceed to give me a medium strength massage, her techniques is good but it's just too light for me, half way through the message I felt quite bored and hoping that the 2nd part would be better and I should have taken 30 mins only.
With 10 minutes left on the clock she offered hj for $20 and nhj for $50, I opted for the $50 option because of her attractive face and smooth skin.
The nhj was average, limited touching is allowed and it's too mechanical, nothing much to write about but she did get me over the line easily.
Typical Chinese massage joint here, standard price and service, I Will not return in a short time or until someone has reviewed a better experience here.

My experience/comments : 

Came across this shop when I needed to change trains at the train station, there has only been one other massage shop around here and i'm pretty sure its legit (plus the lady there doesn't appeal to me). Decided to go in for a try. Got greeted by a ~40 year old asian milf wearing like revealing sleepwear however her body is average at most i.e. flat with no curves it wasn't going to get my heart racing. Anyway got ushered to the room and took the 1 hour option. 

Massage was average nothing to write about, after about 40mins i was asked to turn over and was offered NHJ for $50. Took the option, nothing memorable about the HJ very mechnical - she engaged in DFK and eventually I blew.

Sorry this review isn't that detail but honestly it was a forgettable punt and I might return and try one of the other girls if i'm bored and in the area.

My experience/comments : 

Was in the area and decided to give this place a try again, when i was about the enter the shop I realised there was a sign from lawyers which looks like there is a lease dispute and that no one can enter the shop even the tenant. Anyway I entered and there was an asian gentleman at the desk, which i assume is the owner which i did not see last time. He called out for the lady from the back and she came out. At first glance I thought she was rather attractive when she ushered into the room. 

Anyway I got my gear off and like my previous experience at this store that massage was average at best. Time to turn around and I realised she wasn't as young as i first thought and that she was wearing quite heavy make up to mask this, also you could tell from her aged hands.

Agreed to a nude HJ, she even offered FS but I politely declined as its not my thing I think she asked for $80. HJ was average too and she loved licking my nipple which produced a lot of saliva the was dripping down the side of my body which was starting to gross me out and told her to stop. finally blew and parted with my money and left.

I will most likely not return to this shop as it has been two average punts given what looks like they are having lease problems not sure if it will still be around for long.

My experience:[/COLOR][COLOR=#000080] Saw this sign for remedial massage, it claimed health fund rebates. So I thought what's up with it. Walked in, got some lady, she gave OK massage then gave a HJ..while looking at the ceiling. Got me over the line. Then when I asked for a receipt, they said they dont' do it anymore. But when I asked them as soon as I walked in, they said they do all health fund receipts. Why they lie for. Idiots.[/COLOR][COLOR=#000080][/COLOR]

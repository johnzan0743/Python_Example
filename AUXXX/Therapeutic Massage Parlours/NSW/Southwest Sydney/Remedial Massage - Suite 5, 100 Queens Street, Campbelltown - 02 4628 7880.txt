Person's Name: KayKi

Establishment: Remedial Massage - Unit 3, 19 King Street Campbelltown

Contact Details/Address: Unit 3, 19 King Street Campbelltown    Phone: 4628 7880

Hours of Business: 10am to 6pm - 7 days

Prices: $30 for 30 mins  $50 for 60 mins; $40 for HJ and strip

Date of Visit:  10/04/2012

 Age: 30

Size/shape: Not skinny, medium build, B cup, slight pot tummy

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Massage and Nude HJ

Value for money/recommend?: I guess so

Thought I'd give this place try.    In a small commercial unit block, upstairs.    Plenty of parking in adjacent showground carpark.
Several rooms, partitioned but not to ceilng height.    You can hear everything going on next door.   Quite clean.    The tell-tale tissue box and massage oil on a side table.    I took the 60 minute option.

Kayki (thats how it sounds) has limited English and I would guess she is a recent arrival.     Massage was just ok, she has had no professional training IMHO  .     Covered my butt and legs with a towel while she worked on my back.     Then moved the towel up when she worked on the lower region.    No massage of inside of upper legs and no tackle tickle .    Whilst still on my front asked me if I wanted HJ and clothes off.    Quoted $40 (reasonable) but wanted cash up front which spoilt the mood a bit, so I had to get up, find my wallet etc.   Then lay down on my back.   Straight into the HJ,  no tease or tackle tickle.   Quite a nice body, bit of a pot belly, I wondered if she was pregnant but she said no.     Pink tattoo between the navel and pussy.    Nice pointy nipples, B maybe C cup, and nice bush.   Allowed me to feel clit but forbad me from going inside "not clean" .   I didn't ask whether that was her or me.  

HJ was very ordinary, stroking gently without oil.    I had to tell her that I liked a bit of squeeze with oil.   Said she would be a good fuck (even though I was not interested) and she said "more money", so its probably there if you want it.    Got me over the line eventually.      Then produced a hot towel and cleaned me up.   Quite a good scalp massage and then some rubbing of my legs and chest (I dont call that masaage).    At the end she told me it was her first day.

Massage 5/10
HJ  4/10
Body 6/10

Thanks bent_leg,

Since I live near the area I've got to wonder how you found this place as I've not seen it advertised in the local rags.

Anyway since I had last Monday off I thought why not.
In the morning I stopped procrastinating how I'd spend my day & decided some self-indulgent whoring was the way for the day. I'd worked interstate all weekend so I deserved a treat.
I popped half a Levitra tablet that my Doc suggested I try a couple of weeks back & there was no going back from that point of time since they're so bloody expensive!

I'd already done my main whoring for the day in the late morning (see my new post for Lincoln St Minto) but got a bit toey as the afternoon started to fade so wondering if the new performance standard was still in place but also mindful of the remaining contents of wallet I thought RnT is a low pressure, low cost endeavour so that's now the firm objective. As much as I enjoy Leumeah I decided to do a Captain Kirk & seek out new life as we know it so to speak so the only new venue around I found was a result of the previous post.

Up the stairs we went to see what highlights or lowlights would happen over the next half hour or so. I hate the crap experiences but it's always intriguing to find out about a place not previously experienced.

I was greeted by Sophia at the door. 24yo, darkish skin but definitely Chinese and with reasonable English. She took my hand as soon as I entered & led me to the typical temporary walled partition type room that seems to be the popular way to go in RNT places. Since I figured the hand hold was probably an invitation I thought I be a bit more risque with this one & see what's offered when its turnover time.

I took the 30 mins option for the industry standard of $30 ($50 for 60 mins).
Sophia gave me a pretty good massage I must say. I pointed out a couple of lower back areas that needed special attention & she treated them well.
Sophia let me touch her legs & fondle her bum with no objections during the massage. She often rested her crotch on my elbow so I got a pretty clear message this could be more than a RNT if I wanted. 

When it got to "you turnover now" time I had one hand on her nice backside & another caressing a breast with no objections at all whilst she asked me if I wanted a HJ & telling me it would cost extra. This of course was no suprise, the question is firstly will you do it naked? "YES". "How much?" YOU MAKE ME OFFER." "What else can you do for me?" "YOU TALK TO ME NICE & VERY GENTLE SO YOU WANT FULL SERVICE?" I was hoping for a CBJ at best so was a little surprised.  Again "How much?" YOU MAKE ME OFFER." The old fella had been much harder than usual due to a combined reaction of my attraction to Sophia & the final effects of the Levitra taken some six hours ago so that should been at final ebb however I pressed on hoping a softcock worn out by the unusually overly strenuous demands I was expecting of it would not eventuate. So I blurted out $70. No one else was there besides either a mammasan or another WL & no other punters turned up the whole time I was there & this was around 5PM so end of work time when things can get busy. I probably could've gone as low as $40 & got the same deal but that remains an unknown. What I can say is as short & sweet as it was it was money well spent.

Sophia gave me a reasonable CBJ before lying down on the massage table after requesting I stand up & said "I LIE DOWN, NOW YOU FUCK ME" Hard to argue!

Visited again today, this time met by Linda, 40, petite, Chinese, quite good English.

Excellent massage, will take an hour next time.   At turnover went straight into a great handjob and allowed feel of perky breasts without any mention of extra fee.

Offered her $40 tip - too much took - $20.    So $30 for half hour massage wit HJ + $20 tip.

Great value.

Hours of Business: 10am to 6pm - 7 days

Prices: $30 for 30 mins $50 for 60 mins; $20 for HJ and strip

Date of Visit: 07/08/2012

Age: 30's

Size/shape: Not skinny, medium build, B or C cup, quite reasonable english

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Massage and Nude HJ

Value for money/recommend?: Definitely

Cherry greeted me at the door and showed me to a room, took my $30 for 30 minutes outside. On her return she spotted the $20 I left on the table and asked if I wanted HJ, Yes. I admired and touched her breasts on the outside and asked if I would get to see them. She then removed top and bra without any request for more money. I lowered the pants and briefs without protest and then we had some body to body cuddle standing. She fondled my tackle during this. 

I then offered her a "Blatchford" massage which she accepted and I think rather enjoyed. Several big O's and she wasn't putting it on. She eventually asked me "Stop!  I keep coming!" 

Then it was my turn. Lay on my back and she delivered a nice slow HJ and held me on the edge for quite a while. Eventually I had to let go. 10/10. Then back massage, head massage and the 30 minutes was up.

Excellent value for $50. 

Cherry only works on Tuesdays.

Had another session with Cherry today.   Full description in previous post.     30/30 + 20 HJ + 20 nude, all paid up front.

Gave her a massage and again she had a few big O's then it was my turn.    Reasonable HJ and then a nice back massage and 30 mins was up.

Cherry works Wednesdays only.     $70, $20 more than last time - she has woken up that a strip is worth more money!

Prices: $30 for 30 mins $50 for 60 mins

Age: 24 she says, might be a little older.

Size/shape: Not the usual skinny Chinese, but not too fat, B cup, trimmed

Services: Massage, Nude HJ, FS

Value for money/recommend?: $70 for massage and FS – you bet.

Took 30 minute option and stripped. Gave her a full frontal when she returned to the room and admired her breasts “Will I be seeing those”. “Yes extra”. Amount not discussed. 

Stripped her off without any resistance and commenced a massage of her back. Got her seriously relaxed, then turned her over. Started on the tummy and circled the breasts for a while, then started brushing the nipples which hardened and she closed her eyes. Good sign. Then teased the puss, and after a few minutes of that went for the clit stroke, and she sure did respond.    Said she would be a good fuck. “How much you pay?” “$40”. "OK".    Dommed up, then cowgirl and a HJ to finish me off.

After that a seriously good massage of my back followed.   Not the best I have ever had, but way ahead of most.   Pretty sure this is the same Sophia as tested by chancler earlier in this thread.    

Sophia is good value.    Works on Saturdays only.

Took 30 minute option and stripped. Gave her a full frontal when she returned to the room and said to keep the $20 change. Admired her breasts "I'd like to see those" so she lifted her top and took it off. No mention of money. Undid the bra without resistance. Petite A cup with nice perky nipples.

Offered her massage and followed my usual routine - Got her seriously relaxed, turned her over. Started on the tummy, circled the breasts for a while, then started brushing the nipples and had a suckle. Then teased the puss, and after a few minutes of that went for the clit stroke, and then a deep finger of her sopping wet pussy. Said she would be a good fuck. No response. During the clit tickle she started BBBJ. She sure knows how to do that. 

As I wanted to enjoy the BBBJ, I laid down and she continued the treatment to my climax. After that an acceptable massage of my back and legs. Gave her an extra $20 tip ($40 altogether) for the extras.

Linda is value. Works on Monday to Friday.

The massage place upstairs is the only business left in this centre.    The owner of the premises must be going broke.    

Took 30 minute option and stripped.   Gave her the $20 change and a full frontal when she returned to the room.   

Admired her breasts “I’d like to see those”. “OK” .   She then stripped naked.   I gave her my usual massage but I think she was enduring it, no signs of pleasure.     When I stroked the clit I said she would be a good fuck.   “You want full?”   “Yes, how much?”  “another $20” "OK".   

Saddled up, then she laid back sideways on the massage table with her legs in the air and I entered her standing.   Quite tight.    Fucked her quite hard and the slapping would have been heard by anyone else there, but she didn’t seem concerned.   A fair to middling massage followed, including a hot towel clean up.    

Gave her the extra $20 as I dressed.      Fi-Fi works Saturdays only.

I don’t get why others have not reviewed this place.    The extras and massage are good value.

Hey Bent_leg, 

I called yesterday 17th August in the morning was told Linda & Sophia is working never mentioned the name Fi-Fi at all. So i headed to Campbelltown arrived in the afternoon called again to double check who was available Linda & Sophia available no mention of Fi-Fi so i don't know what time you made your visit to this place on Saturday?

When i arrived on that Saturday only Sophia was available i did not see her as i wanted to see Linda i was told she went out to do shopping, this happened to me last Saturday over the phone Linda & Sophia is working, made the visit & was told Linda went home sick.

So i believe there is only Sophia working on Saturday & when you call you are made to believe Linda & Sophia are working on the Saturday.

Just my 2 cents.

I was there from about 1200 to 1230 on Saturday 17th.    I suspect Fi-Fi was the only one there as I heard no other chatter or noises while I was there.     

I was hoping to see Sophia again, but got Fi-Fi  -  maybe Sophia was at lunch?    I have seen Sophia (see earlier post), she is a different girl (with a brighter personality).

On 6/8 (above) Linda told me she only worked Monday to Friday, so either they are spinning a yarn to one of us or Linda decided to work an extra day.......      I think Linda and Sophia are "old hands" at this place.     

I never ring first, I just drop in and take my chances.

    Value for money/recommend?: not really as better value is around 

greeted at the door by lisa in her 30's b cups medium build , what i like about this place is its very discreet u park your car in the car park and no other business operates from this building besides the massage parlour.no indication of what business is inside and the street doesnt really have any lurkers around either.

was given a rather standard massage nothing to ride home about then asked if i wanted to massage "this one" while pointing to my penor i said yes ,what followed was a pretty standard tug nothing special .

Could hear old men in the background talking and ive heard the same  old mans voice here talking before ,so hearing a middle aged deep voice which overpowers the music isnt too relaxing .

il return to try other girls,does anyone know of any busty women working here???

Interesting  bent_leg, well 2 weeks in a row i received the same story Sophia & Linda are working on Saturday, just before i turn up i ask who's available, the lady says Linda & Sophia not busy never mentions Fi-Fi. Then when i turn up it's always Sophia who answers the door & says Linda went home or has left somewhere.

Unless Linda is there & Sophia is spinning a story saying she is the only one available. I will be heading to this joint again this Saturday to see what happens.

I have been going to Queen Street since they moved there from King Street Campbelltown. There are usually two ladies working there and they do really good massages with HE, the massages are the usual $50 dollars for the hour and $20 for HE. So if you are after a cheap but good massage go to this place. It is nearly opposite the Court House and the cop station I suppose in between both lol, and just upstairs sorry not sure of number I will get it and let you all know.

Person's Name: Anna

Establishment:   Linda’s Remedial Massage

Contact Details/Address:  Upstairs, Suite 5, 100 Queen Street, Campbelltown - Phone: 4628 7880

Hours of Business: 10-6 Seven days

Prices: $30 or $35 for 30 mins, $55 for 60 mins

Date of Visit: Sunday 17 November 2013

Age: 26 she says, I’d say 30.

Size/shape: average height, B cup, landing strip, waist line starting to vanish.

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Massage, Nude HJ 

Value for money/recommend?:   Not really.

This place is the relocation from 3/19 King Street, although I’m pretty sure Anna never worked at the old place (which was closed on Sundays).    Located to the right at the top of the stairs.     Reception area and two small rooms, partitions not to ceiling, lockable folding door, quite clean.      Fresh linen.

Massage was rather ordinary, all pushing through a towel (it was a cold day) with no stroking or oil.    Nothing sensual.     

At turnover wanted $60 for a full strip and $50 for a partial strip.    I said no.   Got the full strip for $50.     Offered her massage and she lay down on her back.     Would only allowing “pushing” type massage like she did on me, with no touching of breasts or lower deck.   Quite nice natural B cups, probably bordering on A cup.   The “no touching” declaration rather turned me off and the old boy sagged in disappointment!    

Next she tried to administer a handjob which was too feathery for me.     I like a reasonable grip of a firm pole with a little oil.     She also kept rubbing the tip before I was hard which became over sensitive.      With some guidance she achieved the aim of the HJ.   I have to say it wasn’t the expected pleasant experience!

There was no-one else in the shop at the time, Anna works Sundays only.      All in all I felt a bit ripped off for the $50 toll.    

I want to see Linda or Sophie next time

Name: Lulu

Address: 5/100 Queen Street Campbelltown

Date of visit: WED 30th July

Rate: $35/30 minutes

Age: late 30's?

Shape: tall and slim

Ethnicity: Chinese 

Value of money/ recommended: yes

Went there on a Wednesday afternoon, got assigned Lulu who I think is the younger one, there was another average looking milf sitting on the couch. 

Paid $35 for half an hour and strip and laid down on the table, Lulu asked if I like soft medium or hard and I opted for hard.  What followed in the next 20 minutes was just what id call soft massage however that was extremely sensual so I didn't complain an just enjoyed and almost felt asleep.  Every 5 minutes shed check how I feel and if im happy.

On the turn over time Lulu asked what I want and I said up to her then she offer a hj for $20 which I agreed.  Didn't ask for more and she didn't offer more.  She then applied oil and started to work, the hj was one of the best that I have had for a while, slow and firm long stroke with both hands.  There was also a lot of encouragement from her words.  I also had my hand running up and down her slim body and she didn't seem to mind at all. 

Overall a good experience and lulu has a good service oriented attitude so id recommend her.

If your visits were in the last three months, a review would be nice xkook1.

Just as much as you can remember about the experience and the lady to convince others that Linda's is pretty ordinary is all that's needed (blanks on the template for the bits you can't remember is fine).

Well I thought I would give this place another go, Linda wasn't working and I should have left then but I thought I would give Yumi a go. She was nice enough and I stayed for the half hour, well that turned into 15 minutes with the HJ, not impressed so the only one I will see here is Linda and thats it but I won't be back in a hurry. Yumi works Sundays and Wednesdays. She was the only one working on Sunday but still rushed the massage and no one else was waiting, I couldn't bother complaining I just won't see her again. She didn't offer nudity and I didn't ask, and she kept well away when doing the HJ from me so there was no touching what so ever, the HJ was 5/10 the massage was 6/10 but way too short.

 Contact Details/Address: Upstairs, Suite 5, 100 Queen Street, Campbelltown - Phone: 4628 7880

 Hours of Business: 10-6 Seven days

 Prices: $35 for 30 mins, $55 for 60 mins

 Date of Visit: Sunday 24 May 2015

 Age: 28 she says, I’d say 30's.

 Size/shape: tall, B cup, bush neatly trimmed.

 Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

 Services: Massage, FS, HJ 

 Value for money/recommend?: OK.

Paid for 30 minutes and she delivered a 7/10 massage.    At turnover she offered HJ for $20 and nude for $40.  Took $40 option.   Massaged her for a while and when I explored the lower deck she offered FS for an extra $10, $50 toll overall.     Did her in mish (covered) for a while with some FOAM apparent, finished off with a 9/10 HJ.

Reasonable value but I thought she was a bit mechanical throughout, although she was pleasant enough and delivered to her promises.   I thought the massage table had a used look (creased sheets) about it when I arrived, although there were no tell tale stains.    As I dressed I said it should be changed for each customer.   Yumi said she always changes it.   I am not convinced.

Yumi works on Sundays only.

Was in the area so paid another visit.     Nice clean shop, two rooms.

Sophie greeted me with a plunging neckline and denim shorts.    I signed up for 30 minutes and tendered extra $20 up front for HJ.     She made no attempt to up sell.

Delivered a very competent firm massage and found some of the kinks I had after spreading a ton of sand yesterday.    Cleaned up with hot towel then some teasing and tackle tickle.     Turned over and the HJ commenced.     She allowed my hands to wander and I felt the nipple on both b cuppers.     Access downstairs was not prohibited but my attempt was thwarted somewhat by the shorts.    Said that's all I get for $20, did not upsell.      A competent HJ was executed with the usual result.

During cleanup I enquired if she did FS, yes for $50 toll.      A pleasant facial massage and massage of the legs and abdomen followed until time.

Sophie works Saturdays only

My experience/comments :
Had been here before and seen some shockers but not on a monday so i thought why not try.
Greeted at the door by lulu and thought yep this will be good.
Asked to wait 10 minutes as she was with another punter.
Into the room and asked for one hour but only given the option of half an hour i was good with that.
Stripped off and sat on the bed and luku came in for a hug and grabbed my cock while i felt her ass.
Lulu stripped and said massage after you cum ok?
I replied fine and lulu asked if i wanted a cbj i asked for to be naked and duly allowed me to help her undress.
Laid down for the cbj with my hands allowed to roam freely just not allowed finger insertion.
The cbj was good with plenty of ball play and just the right amount of suction.
After ten minutes the dom came off for a hj finish.
Lulu then cleaned me up and herself before finishing with a reasonable massage.
Lulu works mondays here with a different girl each day.
Usually only one ml on each day.
No shower facilities either.
Posted elsewhere.

Comment:

This is the same Juju from Maroubra and Kensington whom I visit regularly.  She gave me her number ages ago, so I texted her on a Wednesday to try my luck.

Juju has always been very adamant not to mention any other places she works and it's sometimes difficult for me to get to Maroubra and Kensington on her working days.

Another punter on this forum had mentioned that she works elsewhere, so being badly in need of a Juju fix, I sent her a text asking if she works somewhere else on the day.
I was pleasantly surprised when she texted me the Campbelltown address.  I made a booking by text and made my way out there.

Campbelltown is quite a hike for me, but there's no distance that can deter a horny man with a car... LOL

On street parking was easy. The place is opposite a park near the council chambers.  There are other offices in the complex upstairs (accountants and finance brokers?), which can be a good or bad thing.  People can see you entering and may assume you're there for your taxes, but if you were to bump into another client in the building, they'll know you're there for your 'sore groin'.

The place has two cubicles with gyprock walls but not all the way to the ceiling, and they're quite small. There is a sink but no shower and the toilets are communal ones for the whole floor.  If you need to use them, the ladies give you a key as they're not public toilets.

I always get extra excitement from seeing a regular lady at a new place, and this was no different.  The sound proofing of the cubicles wasn't great, I could clearly hear the punter in the next cubicle chatting to the other ML.  However, they efficiently turn up the music when delivering part 2 of the massage. 

Unlike Maroubra and Kensington, Juju was wearing a nice summer dress and make up.  Seeing her all dolled up made me even hornier... 

I didn't waste any time getting down to business and after her trademark bbbj, it was on with the dom and I was fucking her in all positions.  It was great...

The harder she was trying to keep her noises down, the harder I was fucking her.  She soon worked out what I was up to and gave me the biggest glowing smile.

The obligatory CIM followed by a massage, and then her trademark 2nd BBBJ to completion to top off a fantastic session.

It's probably a bit too far to travel for me, but when an urgent Juju fix is required it's great to know she's available there on Wednesdays.

Cheers,

cato

A quick hand and on with the dom for various positions with honey enjoying herself getting wet requiring no lube but natural juices.

Honey has return value.

Recommend: Yes

Comment: Out this way so stopped in at one of the places I remembered from the Forum. Easy to find, ring the doorbell to have someone answer, Lisa was the one, there were 2 ladies working. Into 1 of the 2 small cubicles and after the payment onto the bed. Lisa's massage was actually quite good. A similar process to most Chinese places, after the hot towel wipe down the soft touching and tackle tickle started. On the flip I was offered a HJ or FS, I took the second. Straight on with a cover and a enough of a CBJ to get my cock hard before she popped on for some CG. She was at it for a while and was sweating before she asked me to take over with some standing Mish. The rooms are small so she had one foot on the wall while I did the work. She would occasionally pulse her pussy and tighten it around my cock, that was interesting. After some minutes we switched over to Doggy, and her butt still had some good grip firmness. Back onto the bed and the cover came off for some Hand action to get my load released. Outside the 2 little rooms there was a sink and she motioned me to use it to wash down before hitting the road.

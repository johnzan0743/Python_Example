Sup People,

Don't have time for a full review just yet, but wanted to spread the word - the Natasha Day Spa people have opened in Camden. 

It's hardly legit, got a sweet RnT + topless HJ just this week (review to follow).

But most importantly, up until October it's $50 for an hour. That's a bargain for the quality + the location (i.e., nice clean Camden, not dodgy, dirty Bankstown), but it's only until October ends.

Details @ http://natashadayspa.com.au/ - check it out! 

Jimmy

I was in Camden today (Friday) so decided to give this place a run.      Greeted by Tam, small, Thai, typical A cup, aged about 23.     Questioned me how I knew about the $50 per hour deal in her broken English.     Told her "it's on the website".      Set up is in a house, the massage room was at the front with blinds drawn and a large flat Thai style massage bed.     A stupid little u shaped pad for my head which I swapped for a pillow.      Fresh towel on the bed, quite clean.

Massage proceeded, quite good actually, I'd give it about 8/10 for technique but wait, there's more.    When she finished my front and I suggested HJ, she quoted $50.   I managed to beat her down to $35 which I think was a bit over the top but I went with it.    The HJ consisted of the old boy being drowned in oil and then her hand sliding up and down it which I could hardly feel, with some groping of the sack with the other hand at the same time.    Not sensual at all and didn't produce the goods.    When I said I'd had enough she said it was all finished now and left me, leaving me with an oily back, oily front and oily old fellow.     No attempt was made to remove the oil with a hot towel.     I managed to towel myself off but was rather p'd off with this gap in the service.     If I had sprayed I probably would have had to clean that up too!

I would recommend the massage if she had finished the job with a hot towel, but alas she didn't.    

Tam needs to learn how to do an acceptable HJ - I won't be teaching her!

Seems to be one of four shops  ( others in  Bankstown, Cabramatta, Casula) 


Was in the area today, as the gestapo was going to visit someone so had a few hours to kill to explore the town.

Opened AXR on the iphone, read this thread and called the shop.   Thanks Jimmyboi84!

Booked an hour and found the house nearby the  town main strip.

Had an hour massage with Bua, an attractive Thai woman,  slim, yet firm body.
She has been her two months and her English is  limited. She works at the sister shops as well.

I tried to coheres Bua to receive a massage from me,  but she didn't want to because it was her job to massage me.

Ok so I struck out,  and decided to let Bua give me a one hour massage, which I really was looking forward to.

I received a very good  firm  professional massage from lovely Bua.   No nonsense or teasing, by the book.
Probably best massage from ML in Sydney in a long time. 

I tried a few times to caress a thigh or her firm bum, but she giggled and moved my hand each time.

At the end of the massage she allowed me to give her a short shoulder and neck massage. She seemed quite happy and asked if I could massage her next time I visit ( unlikely for  me to be in Camden in the near future).

I noticed she was caressing my arm and leaning against me.. more relaxed and she started to ask me a few personal questions.. 
We chatted and I was caressing her hair and back,  and she was smiling. She is quite pretty and gentle.

 If I had time I would have extended the stay and see what kind of massage Bua would like me to administer.

She asked if  I want a HJ.  
 I said yes. 
 She said $50.. 
 I suggested $30. 
 She said $50 is the price the girl will want...


Wait a minute..


Bua was  suggesting another girl come in to jerk  me off, as she doesn't do it herself, only massage.

  I hesitated .. but said Ok.

Wasn't real happy at this point. WTF  was I doing.


In comes a young slim attractive Thai girl.. think her name is Mina.

She is Bua's HJ for hire.

I asked if she will take off her top ...  she said no.. just a HJ.

At this point I decided forget it, said I would have preferred Bua to do it.  
Also  too expensive  (and also too weird.... by the number mechanics..)

I had a sublime HJ/CBJ from the mother of all cock  teasers (Hannah, ex 104 Hamden,  now at Harmony) at no extra charge  a few  days earlier, and this was only downhill.

 She shrugged, walked out, and  rattled off in Thai to someone outside the door.

 I dressed and stepped out to so Bua looking a little  embarrassed. She took my hand and said she was sorry.
I apologised to her,  and she gave me a little hug and peck on the cheek.

Said goodbye and on my way to pick up the gestapo ( ....where were you??) 


So the shop may have some legit ML and and others who may play the game.

Clean premises,   nice size rooms.. Shower was an awkward walk across the house.


 WAK  ( spoilt from recent KL trip)

What an experience, Wak. 'HJ with that order sir ?', "No thank you". "Mina, hold the HJ !"

A cool, calm and collected Wak to walk out on the HJ handover. A sucker like me would have taken it and left feeling disappointed (and silly).

Nice job and nice review.

Sup Fellas,

Not going to worry re: details of the place, all up above. Have been to this place three times now (lol), apologies for not getting on earlier - but time being what it is, just no chance. Anyway, why three times you ask? Well my first experience was fantastic, can barely recall the girls name, but she gave a great massage and I got the HJ extra for $30 - which I figured was a pretty good deal, given the quality of the massage and the fact that's it 'historic Camden' and not the usual Cabra-dive. 

That brought me back a second time, which (sadly), lead to a rather unhappy affair which seems more consistent with what others are finding. I dropped in perhaps 2 x weeks back, it was a Thursday - can't recall the girls name (sorry) but she only works Thursday and she also works @ the sister place across at Parra. After a 7/10 massage, she offers HJ but for $50. I tried to negotiate and was met with a flat response. Stunned, I took my dick and headed elsewhere - have never had a girl say to me 'I'd rather have NOTHING than give you a HJ for $30', but w/e.

Naturally, driving past today I had to stop in - 1 x fantastic experience, 1 x horrible one, clearly needed the tie-breaker ... lady I saw today was nice, older, slim, not curvy or attractive in that 'young hot makes you want to fuck the shit out of her' way, more your quiet WL who lets her skills do the talking - and fuck me, talk they did! Paid $50, got comfy, and what preceded was a most relaxing, thorough and enjoyable thai/oil massage. Interesting, there was no deliberate tackle tickle, but a lot of sliding and rubbing and tickling of sides, thighs and stomach that had the same effect.

Halfway through I roll over, she begins to plying her wares on the front side - which I always enjoy, followed by ye olde HJ offer. Again - met with flat response re: $50. This lady explains they're trying to go for a standard, same across all workers. Enjoying myself I go with it. HJ starts slowly, oiling up my chest, down my legs, balls etc. Technique was arguably the best I've ever had, slow and gentle, building up, then relaxing, tickling, teasing - might sound stupid, but when I closed my eyes and lay back, felt virtually the same as oral. 5 x minutes of this and it was all over, fantastically so. Massage continued for another 20 mins, very good. Left feeling awesome.

So - good things about this place. Location! Camden is quiet, clean and oh so safe compared to Livo etc. Don't feel like I'm going to get mugged in this sleepy little hollow. Range of girls, polite, friendly, clean rooms. Bad things - basically $50/50 for massage/HJ. I get what they're doing re: standard pricing, but it's just too high for HJ only and it takes away the fun of finding a slightly more willing or engaging girl. It also means some (like the 2nd girl I tried) aren't going to try as hard to please, since they know they can make no more/less. The walls are also paper thin, which can be disturbing at times. Finally - not hot towel, and from what I can tell, no shower. Not an issue if you're heading home like me, but definitely not a place to head to on your lunch break. Not unless you enjoy being oily and wet. 

My verdict? I say we vote with our feet - go, have a massage, offer $20 and then leave if they refuse. Won't take long for word to get round and the prices to drop. @ these prices, I would give this place the flick unless you either really want the comfort of being in Camden, or you live some place far ass away and this is the only option you have. As someone who travels a lot, I probably won't be going back any time soon - not with Liverpool etc just 20 minutes up the highway on the way home. :P

Thanks Jimmy. The reason I ask the name was there was girl working at Casula called Wiki who you to give the best massage and HE but I heard she no longer gives the HE. I know she works at Camden on Fridays so I was curious if it was her back giving the HE.

Cheers

Will

Wiki works there on a Saturday and is giving HJs again but they have been inspected a couple of times by the council so they need to be careful. I was there a while back and met up again with Wiki but the HJ wasn't all that memorable Her heart isn't in it anymore. I didn't leave a report at the time due to focus they were under being newly opened.

I was down in the area last week. 
Couldn't get into the shop as only one lady there,  and she was booked. 
Read elsewhere that rnt  is  more available, so thought another attempt might reap something wonderful.

Ended up at Anna's Massage in Camden.
Older chinese ML..
Legit shop. Had an excellent massage.

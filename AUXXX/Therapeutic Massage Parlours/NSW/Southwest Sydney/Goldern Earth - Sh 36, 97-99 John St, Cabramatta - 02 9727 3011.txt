My experience/comments: Looking for a TOFTT adventure, found myself in Cabramatta. Spotted this place inside one of the small shopping complexes along the main drag.

CiCi was the only lady working as it was nearing closing time. They have 3 or 4 rooms, with walls to within a foot of the ceiling. Sliding door with no lock. Set-up was a little bit untidy and possibly not that clean.

Stripped down to my boxers as I was feeling a bit shy!  She started with a good oil massage of my back & neck. Then progressed to my legs. No bruching or tickling. I was then asked to turn over. CiCi was then kind enough to ask if I would like a HJ for $20, which I accepted. She removed my boxers, and proceeded to provide me with a very compentent HJ. She allowed me to lift her shirt and get her breasts out of her bra, which would have been a B/C cup. She did have a little bit of tummy fat. There was mutual nipple sucking involved.

Overall not a bad experience. If I found myself in the area again and toey would consider returning. Then again, there was a Vietnamese massage place opposite (shop 26) which may be worth trying out.

Cheers,

BAB

First off no touchee here, 100% legit, and they seem possibly a bit nervous at first, incase you may not realise this.

I am often surprised when someone returns from Thailand and talks about wonderful Thai massages but basically describes a shiatsu massage. True Thai Massages are Torture, I am never to sure whether I feel good afterwards because of the effect on my muscles or from all the endorphins released due to the pain.

I have been several times to Sangs
This time it was a woman named Tanh.
Tanh used her finger tips, thumbs, wrists, elbows, knees, toes and  heels to torture every muscle in my body from every angle she could get. Only pausing to wrap my limbs in knots before contorting the rest of my body by using my knotted limbs as leverage. 

I have known people to go on my recommendation only to have them complain the massage was soft.
I suspect you need to explain that you understand a Tradition Thai massage is painful.

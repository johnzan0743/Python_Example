My experience/comments : 

I visited here on the spur of the moment. I had seen ads in the old Cracker and sent an SMS in those days so still had the number. Its a challenging place to get to if you are driving.
I walked in and Coco greeted me. First impression is that Coco is Trans. Not overly masculine but more in form, jawline etc. Not unattractive. Feminine voice and pleasant. 
I opted for the $40 for 30 minutes option. Coco said to take all the cloths off and cover myself with the towel. I covered my ass only.
The massage was good. More sensual than therapeutic. Focused on my back and buttocks. No TT and asked to flip.
I flipped and no inclination form her or me to cover the tackle. She then massaged around the old fella before I commented on her "Beauty".
Offered HJ and topless for $50 and "suck" for $100.
Opted for the $50. No sign of taking the bottoms off. This also feeds my suspicion of the her being TS, as well as her "perfect' D cup enhanced boobs. Too perfect.
I wasnt bothered either way.
The HJ was pretty good with good "back hand" work. I get impatient so helped it along and blew hard.
The cleanup was with paper towels you get in the public wash rooms. She also got some of the oil off with warm towel.
This was all a bit hurried as she said she had a booking arriving in 10 minutes.

General Points
This shop is on New South Head Road, about 250 metres down from Edgecliffe station.
Its a quiet shop.
Its a busy road where parking is a challenge. I suspect thats the main drawback.
Coco says today is her last day.
Coco says the owner is selling the ship by the end of the month.
Coco works Thursdays in Wollongong. Sawadee Massage.
Perfect enhanced D cups. 
Good HJ.

As always , apologies in advance if I have left anything out.

My experience/comments : 

This is my 3rd trip to see Amy. While there does not seem to be a thread here on this place I did go there originally after reading a comment regarding Amy at 115 as being a great massage therapist. So thanks to who ever wrote that as I have had some great visits here. This place is just a few doors down from the thai place at 119 and it is also up the stairs. Just note that there is a bus stop outside the entrance so there could be many people standing there waiting for their bus. 

Amy is a nice friendlly lady who enjoys her job. She is the owner here and usually has one other lady working with her. The rooms have real doors and walls but they don't go up to the ceiling so you can hear if their is another punter there. Today I take the 1 hr option so I take my clothes off and wait for Amy to come back and she asks what type of massage. I ask for firm.

The first part of the massage is done without oil with some great kneading and prodding and also with Amy kneeling on my back which I love. Amy definitely has been doing massage for a long time and she knows what she is doing. After te oil is added she then works on every part of my back, neck and legs. I think that I even dozed off at one point. Her english is not bad and she engages in some idle chat and conversation throughout. At about the 40 minute mark she asks me to turn over and does some light tickling around my balls and asks if I want a HJ. She does some great teasing and a nice slow HJ which has a great ending. She allowed some light touching through her clothes but no offer to get te gear off. After a hot towel for cleanup she then proceeds to give me a nice head massage and foot massage.

Overall, I enjoyed the experience and would rate the massage as good as Jenny at Hornsby.

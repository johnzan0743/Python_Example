My experience/comments : Every now and then, I need a good legit massage and I go here for it. I have had a few massages here and feel better for it. 

I usually opt for $50.00 for the 45 mins and get a hard massage. 

Sue manages to find all the sore/Tight spots and works on them and I leave feeling better.

When U walk in, on the left hand side are the massage tables with curtains. Every time I get a massage there, the girls tend to leave the curtains slightly open to kill off any hint of a HJ. There are boxes of tissues on the corner table so maybe U can get them. I have always left my undies on and never been asked if I wanted a HJ....

Conclude by saying massages are good, place is clean, staff are nice and no hint of a HJ...would be keen to see if anyone has had a HJ here.

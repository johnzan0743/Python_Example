A new massage shop opened in the last few days in Bondi Junction. It operates out of the back of a terrace which is located on the corner of Newland Street and Ebley Streets. Entrance is at the side of the terrace on Ebley Street. I have marked the entrance on the attached capture from google.

There is a sign which simply states

Sydney Thai Massage Clinic 
0422 940 223 
$49 oil massage

Looks to dodgy to be legit.

this place is legit. 

2 very small rooms. The two ladies working there are lovely and hospitable. I was naked during the massage (covered in towels), but nothing came close to even suggesting something more is on offer. I do recommend for a $69 1 hour legit oil massage.

Person's Name : Katie

Establishment : Sydney Thai Massage Clinic

Date of Visit : 23/11/2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 54 Newland St, Bondi Junction

Hours of Business : 10 am - 7 pm (I think)

Rates : $60/50/40 for 60/45/30 minute massage

Age : mid 20's

Size/shape : size 10ish, very short

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

Katie gives a pretty hard massage, I've been a few times and I was sore after each visit but was a kind of good soreness. I like the way she climbed all over me putting in elbows and body weight into sore areas. She's very short and cute looking I guess is the best way to describe and has a pretty good rack (although not sure if she gets naked), I feel like she looks kind of mischievous as well. 

Always a good time as she's friendly and gives a good happy ending (HJ is all I have had).

Most likely will go back. I've seen her there on a few Sundays but think she works there most days.

Also to get to the massage shop there is an entrance as in the photo above but from here you need to turn right and walk down the makeshift corridor. Inside the massage rooms are not proper rooms, it's one of those setups with one room being partitioned by a big curtain.

Person's Name : Kim/Katie

Establishment : Sydney Thai Massage Clinic

Date of Visit : 21/12/2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 54 Newland St, Bondi Junction

Hours of Business : 10 am - 7 pm (I think)

Rates : $60/50/40 for 60/45/30 minute massage

Age : mid 20â€™s

Size/shape : size 10ish, very short

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : R&T ($20)

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

The setup at this place is that Kim does the massage then Katie comes in later to do the second part. Kim gives an awesome massage actually so I think it's pretty good doing it this way.

I've described Katie in a previous post and I think it's pretty good value for money and most likely will go back. I did find out that she does HJ and nothing extra.

This operator has been around in BJ for a number of years haaving operated various clinics in the Junction area including Spring street. She has consolidated her businesess here and I am not certain as to whether this will staay under the current thread or if it will need to go under Purely Therapeutic Massage thread for NSW only. I guess it will depnd upon the experience others have encountered here.
It has all the signs of a R&T but just not quite offering the final finsh so to speak. Only time will tell and if you guys have the time please tell.



Person's Name : Karina

Establishment : Allys Health and beauty Centre 2 Waverley Street Bondi Junction.

Date of Visit :October 2013 

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : www.wellhealth.com.au 


Hours of Business : 10am to 7pm or by appointment Different girls different days.

Rates : $60 per hr massage.

Age : 24

Size/shape : Slim size 8 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Brazil

Services Provided : massage therapeutic

Value for money/recommend? : Yes for the massage alone well worth it. 

My experience/comments : Karina works Mon Thurs and Saturdays.
She is a student on a student visa. Rather pretty with dark hair.

I wasn't sure as there was no reviews for this shop and I am sure that there was a reason for that and there was. The thread 2A Waverley Street BJ was an old buiding with a Thai R&T in it. Long since closed and Ally decided to move her operation into this building. Refurbished well set out but a little cramped. the room has a shower but there are other rooms without.
Made a booking to see the boss but she was busy when I arrived at the booking time and so was given another lass a Brazillian girl. I thought this cannot be that bad at worst I had booked in for a $35 half hour session.
I got undressed there were tissues on the counter but this girl looked fairly straight. So expectations were rather low.
Undressed onto the table commando and no comment by the lass.
She covered me with a towel and started what i thought was a rather lame massage. I say what i thought. However as the stretching became more intense I settled into what was one of the best massages I had encountered for some time.
The massage was in no way sensual but it was extremely relaxing not to mention very good. Did i mention the massage was very good well in case I failed to mention it it was fabulous. As straight massages go you drift off and really relax and immediately I said to her I would like to extend for the hour.. Bugger it I knew the tackle massage was not on (call it intuition!) but I was just in lurve with this girls hands and the way she was massaging my old bones. I felt like I never wanted her to stop the massage. I could have died on the table a very contented man not having my jewels touched was no problem the massage had won me over. The pressure applied was halfway between ecstacy and agony. But it was just right. Having a massage that is simply great is a rare thing. Sometimes we go for the happy ending to make up for the pathetic massage technique. But when the technique is great we don't need the ending to be happy as we already are.


After the hour was up I was offered a shower but turned it down as the oil I was needing to hydrate my old skin. i was given a hot towel to wipe the excess oil off. I got a receipt to claim back the massage. They are accredited to issue and therefore represent great value for money.

Now I didn't go much into her massage technique but assure you it is really rather good. She was asked the question approaching the end of my allotted time. The answer was a strict no way. I just accepted that and did not push. Another review to come shortly.

BTW If anyone has any intel or any experience at this place/venue please please please share it with us.

That is all for the moment!

Now not being content at having been given another ML at the first attempt I decided to have another go at seeing the bosslady. Out of respect I won't call her the Mamasan as most of her workers ML's are European students/backpackers.
So the only thing to do was to check out the bosslady and the review is as follows.

Person's Name :Ally 

Establishment : Allys Health & Beauty Centre 2 Waverley Street Bondi Junction 02 93877199 


Date of Visit : October 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As above but Wellhealth: Massage, Remedial Massage therapy, Acupuncture, Herbs and Skin Care Products online 


Hours of Business : As per website and above but Ally will take booking and after hours if she knows you will turn up. They also do mobile.

Rates : $60 p/hr massage

Age : Late 30's possibly early 40's but who of us can tell without asking?

Size/shape : size 10 decent 'c' cups but well hidden.

Nationality or Ethnicity :MLC 

Services Provided : Massage kind of sensual

Value for money/recommend? : Yes great massage with possibility of more perhaps.

My experience/comments :

Now this lady is a very experienced TCM practitioner. Unlike most who claim to be TCM and cross the line straight away I have the distinct feeling there is more on offer than meets the eye.
I was shown to the room and asked to place my clothes on the hooks and chair. I undressed placed my clothes on the rack and clothes hooks. Now the room was different from the previous session. A little more room but not much. The table was draped in a cloth covering which was newly placed upon the table. There was a box of tissues and a bin in the corner. All telltale signs. Well I wasn't so certain. I looked in the bin and it appears to have tissues in it but not the usual clumped tissue pile that you see typical of a R&T parlour. There was a hint of total professionalism at this place. But I am almost certain that is a sham.
Nonetheless I undressed and climbed onto the table. 
Now for those who have not read before one of my reviews and I always have the policy of removing the underwear regardless of what I am told. This way I don't have to have the oil ruin the elastic in the reg grundies and I give ample access to a wanton ML to access the boys. Just in case she is wantin to access them.
Well I climbed onto the table giving Ally a partial full frontal. I didn't get any reaction as most of these MLC mature workers give nothing away. So I was perhaps still in with a chance.

The towel was placed over me and the massage commenced. First with full body stretches. An excellent technique that stretches the muscles and tendons and prepares the areas for blood flow which enhances the endorphin release. A great technique observed by those in the know.
Now she did the stretches and then pulled the towel back and started to oil me up. Well was I in for a treat. She pulled the towel down so my buttocks were exposed. I was having warm thoughts and a good feeling about this but was not convinced there was anything else to come so to speak.

Well she spent around twenty minutes on the upper back and buttocks and then placed the towel back over the buttocks and upper back Part one was completed. Part two was the legs. Now there had been no tackle touching up to this point but the proximity of her hands to my speshal parts was closer than my latest haircut. I had a number 2. So close it was. I was enjoying the massage tremendously and again was thinking this is just soo good I really care less if there is a henja to complete. The legs were uncovered one at a time and she went right up into the groin and with plenty of pressure. I was in heaven. She did the same for both sides and I lifted myself off the table ever so slightly as I was now fully aroused. I was absolutely loving this session. I couldn't believe it twice lucky with a massage in the one establishment.

Now the massage continued with plenty of incidental touching but nothing apparently deliberate. The other leg completed and then the question or rather instruction please turn over. Well I did and smiled at Ally.
She did not react. Probably been there more times than you could poke a stick at but didn't flinch.
She continued the massage on the front and did a head massage and then moved down and did the feet. I asked how much time left and was told 5 minutes. Well I knew that this was not to be my day as always in any session the girl if she is going to do the henja starts with at least 10 minutes to go as she has no idea how long it will take to finish the job and believe it or not most want to see the client happy. Happy clients return. Sad or angry ones rarely return without a machete or a gun. Just joking but you never know.
So I figured I would have to ask the question and so did. The answer came back a little hesistant at first but I am fairly sure she has a stock answer of no first time up with you so time will tell.

I was given a hot towel wiped down and had a polite conversation with Ally. She feined embarrassment but I know she wasn't. Not in the slightest.

If anyone has had any luck or has any intel on Ally or this place please review or report it. 

The funny thing is after I received my receipt and was on the way out the door she told me "you come back see girl she very pretty. I asked who she was talking about and she said I have other girls working here who are very beautiful.
Now I normally can read this as a hint but in her case I think she may be lost in translation. Perhaps she is trying to encourage me to become a regular and return.
I have stated what will make me a regular but she has dismissed this but I am not altogether certain this is a forever or a never situation.
The mere fact that she has some good looking girls who can really massage working for her is a hook on its own. I just have to be certain that is not the hook that sucks me in and spits me out. Time is precious and whilst the massage is great I have needs that want to be met.
just uncertain if she understands that! The thing is she may also be worried because she is uncertain about me.  


.That is all.

Oh I have just realised the girl she was referring to she has written on the receipt. I cannot make it out but she has put Frenchie alongside of the name begining with "C" I think. I will probably need to attend again very soon as my back is feeling a little neglected. After all it hasn't been touched in over 48 hours. Dear oh dear!

I forgot that these guys of course run after every ten massages you get the 50% off the tenth massage on the card. That means you get a 5% discount across the ten massages. Or better if you make the first nine 30 minute massages and then the tenth an hour. Saving 10%. 

BTW French girl name Amy very good looking. Karina spelt by bosslady with a C instead of a "K" is what was written on card.


That is all.

Yes lads, this joint is now on spring street. I came across it several months ago. I have pretty much been through the entire roster of girls there. I'll be honest l am no good with names, but l have had a few sessions from foreigners - backpackers - and although l am yet to get a tug, l have gotten one of the backpackers girls to get her tits out and l gave them a good licking. There are some REAL lookers here, but sadly many will not do anything. I had one little Cambodian??? girl give one  me a massage recently (I had seen her twice) and l asked a few times for a HJ but she refused and said l can do it myself, so l proceeded top while she rubbed my upper thighs, gracing my balls on each stroke. 

Keep in mind, this joint is a as strong a YMMV as you can get. Better off checking the other joints around Bondi Junction. 

Another tip, there is a chinese joint a few blocks down spring street that offers a very competent massage, and occassionaly a tug, but most of the girls l wouldn't pursue as they aren't the best lookers.

 Zoe  Bondi Junction, NSW  02 9387 7199
				
Post Content: 
Person’s name: Zoe

Establishment: Ally’s Health and Beauty Centre. Shop 3, 175-181 Oxford Street, Bondi Junction (located in Royal Arcade opposite St. George Bank in the Mall).

Date of visit: November 2015.

Contact details: 02 9387 7199; 0411 798 787; Wellhealth: Massage, Remedial Massage, Therapeutic Massage, Acupuncture, Herbs and Skin Care Products ,massage bondi junction

Hours of business: Contact Ally’s (I think it is roughly 10am-7pm 7 days a week).

Rates: $60 for a one hour massage (it says out the front health fund rebates are available – although I didn’t get a receipt this time around).

Age: Early-20s.

Size and shape: Gorgeous. 5’7”, long blonde hair, 50kgs, dress size 6-8, C-cup breasts, really fit body and a cute face. Sexy as all hell accent.

Ethnicity: French.

Services provided: Massage, and Zoe will watch you jack off for a small fee.

Value for money / recommend. $60 for an hour massage is value for money. I would recommend Zoe’s massage as it was one of the best I have ever had.

My experience / comments: Ally's establishment has a thread, here: https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f58/a...highlight=ally

Having been left high and dry by Silvana, here: https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f307/...53/#post201018 I thought I may as well jump back on the train at Redfern and head to Ally’s at Bondi Junction.

I called up and a man answered. I asked what nationalities he had on. He said four ladies. French, Cambodian, and two Chinese. As soon as I heard ‘French’ I told him I’d be there within the hour.

Finding the shop was pretty easy. I enter and am greeted by two Asian women (one was the Mamasan I think – she had a cheeky grin on her face). I asked to see the French woman. They told me two French women were on so I requested I have the best one (i.e., best masseuse). They called out Zoe.

Wow – what a sexy little minx. Zoe was dressed in long black tights and a loose-fitting grey shirt.

Even if nothing else was on offer, I couldn’t wait to have her hands gliding all over my body.

Into the room and asked to strip down and to jump on the table. The massage begun, and to my pleasant surprise, Zoe is actually a great masseuse. What ensured was an extremely firm, yet satisfying, massage.

I tucked my dick down between my legs and unfortunately there was no tackle tickle. Bummer. The back of me was massaged to perfection and I am wiped down with a hot towel.

Flip over and Zoe isn’t too fussed about seeing my cock, but she covers me nonetheless.

Starts on my legs and I move around so the towel falls off me. Zoe didn’t re-cover me, instead she carried on with the massage. So here I now am, hard as a rock, with her massaging my inner thighs, every now-and-again brushing up against my ball sack. Wipes me down with the hot towel again, and I’m still hard as fuck.

Massage over.

Shit?!

I’m desperate. “Will you take care of this” I say to Zoe pointing at my cock. “Oh no. Sorry. I don’t do that” is her reply in her sexy French accent. Shit?! Think quick?! “Can I relieve myself?” Her reply is “you can do whatever you want to do when I leave the room.” Damn?! I want this beautiful young woman to watch me jack off. “I’ll pay you $20 to stay in the room.” A smile crosses her face “sureeeee.”

So I’m going hell for leather with her watching on. I ask if many guys do this, to which she replies “oh sure. Lots of guys do this.” Cheeky girl…

Anyways. I cum, clean-up, get dressed, and give her the $20. She slips it casually into her pants smooth as silk boxers on satin sheets I could tell she’s done it plenty of times before.

We both walk out and the Mamasan and Papasan is also there now. I fork over my $60 and thank them and Zoe. The Mamasan is trying not to piss herself laughing. I forgot to get a receipt for my private health fund but who cares.

Will I be back – definitely!

Many thanks as always for reading!

Excuse me for a moment, as I feel like the odd one out. 

I visited this place for the first time recently based on the above reviews and… I got a HJ. Price wasn't even discussed until pay time. Did I get lucky?

I'm reluctant to name the girl as I wouldn't want her to get in trouble, or have 10 guys calling for her all asking for a HJ… So maybe I can post a review using a pseudonym?

Another note. I would had never visited this place if it wasn't for this forum, so thank you!

not quite a review... booked an appointment yesterday at 6pm. Did not ask for any particular girl.. full intention of just getting one of their skilled therapeutic massages. 

I got a older MLC bird called Monica. 40+ 5'5 and slim build with a bit of covering. Quite a competent massage. 

Actually offered me a HJ towards the end but l passed. 

Not the best looker there but gives a relaxing massage.

TL;DR: If you don't have time to read the full review I'll state here that I did not receive any sexual services. Although, there is some good intel (I hope) in my review about the practices in this place.

Person’s name: Angela.

Establishment: Ally’s Health and Beauty Centre. Shop 3, 175-181 Oxford Street, Bondi Junction (located in Royal Arcade opposite St. George Bank in the Mall).

Date of visit: November 2015.

Contact details: 02 9387 7199; 0411 798 787.

Hours of business: Contact Ally’s (I think it is roughly 10am-7pm 7 days a week).

Rates: $60 for a one hour massage (it says out the front health fund rebates are available – although I didn’t get a receipt this time around).

Age: Early-20s.

Size and shape: Larger girl although she has a pretty face. Dress size 12-14, long black hair, brown eyes, C-cup breasts.

Ethnicity: Colombian.

Services provided: Remedial massage, nothing more.

Value for money / recommend. $50 for a 50 minute massage is value for money, but I would not recommend Angela if you want anything more.

My experience / comments: Having time on Saturday morning to kill and after a shit week at work I was in need of a massage. Ally's price of $60 for 60 minutes with the possibility of a health fund rebate sounded like the best go.

I ring up Ally's and the Papasan answers. I ask how many girls are on and what nationality they are. He answers one Aussie, one Colombian, and one Chinese.

As soon as I heard "Colombian" my mind was made up. Five minutes later I was on the train to Bondi Junction.

Arriving at Ally's the Mamasan is sitting on the chair and the Papasan (I think his name is Johnson?) is on the phone. Mamasan tells me to wait until Johnson is off the phone and he'll help me. The Papasan is having some type of conversation along the lines of "oh long time no speak, yes you come in, we have Colombian for you, ok you be here 5 minute." I'm thinking oh shit someone is gonna take my Colombian hottie. Not to worry, Johnson hangs up and I request the Colombian. He says "no problem", directs me to the room, and tells me an "Angela" will be with me shortly.

Sweet!

I strip down butt naked, jump on the table, and point my dick down between my legs.

Angela comes in and she is a bigger girl than I expected. Oh well, no worries. She says to me "long time no see" to which I reply "uh, I haven't seen you before, but I've been here before" (rookie mistake, I know).

Angela begins the massage and doesn't drape me. Good sign. There is no tackle tickle but the fact she doesn't drape me is encouraging.

While I'm getting massaged three women come into the shop at different times (one quite elderly) and I can hear them all making conversation with the Johnson and the Mamasan. Each of these three women definitely want legit services. I can also hear Johnson throughout the massage answering the phone and saying totally illegitimate shit like "we have three girls Colombian Aussie and Chinese" while these legit customers are in there which I think is quite funny / risky on his behalf. Is this why I didn't get anything? Who knows?

Then a strange as fuck thing happens. Someone "mistakenly opens" the door for five seconds then closes it. I'm facing down so have no idea who it was. Anyways, the massage is never the same since then.

Angela informs me she is going to get a hot towel and throws some draping over me before leaving the room.

She comes back and towels me down then asks me to flip.

I flip over and she drapes me. I kick the towel away and she places it over me again. Damn.

She is rubbing me very close to my balls so I kick the towel away again, and, Angela places it over me again. But giggles, wtf? Damn.

Again, she is now brushing up against my balls, so I begin thrusting my hips up and down trying to give her the message. Angela tells me to calm down and relax. But giggles again wtf? Damn.

I chill and place one hand under the towel (not even stroking, just place it next to my cock to see what Angela says). She asks me what I'm doing. I say nothing. She says you better not be stroking yourself to which I lift up the towel and say "I'm not, see, I've just got my hand beside it."

Angela giggles but rolls her eyes and says I don't do that but I can get another girl to come in.

I tell Angela I'll give her extra money to do it. She says no (and is starting to get pissed). Fair enough. I ask if I can do it. She says no.

I request her to get the other girl (like she mentioned two seconds earlier) to which Angela now replies "we're not that kind of shop". Yeah bullshit?! Then she asks me "who did it for you last time?" Yeah right, like I'm going to rat out the other girl. By now Angela. Is. Pissed. And, so I don't feel like the ultimate creep I request the massage to finish at the 50 minute mark. Angela says she will only charge me $50 and leaves the room.

I walk out, pay, and request 30 minutes with another girl. Angela goes behind the curtain and asks if the (Aussie?) girl wants a massage off this creepy, sexual deviant out there. The Aussie girl declines.

I'm horny as fuck, leave, and walk down the mall to one of the Asian joints to get some relief.

So in conclusion:
1. Were Johnson and the Mamasan concerned extras would occur while there were legit customers in there? Perhaps.
2. If you've seen Angela more than once will she provide extras? Perhaps.
3. Will the Aussie girl provide extras if you haven't just come across like a total creep to one of her colleagues? Perhaps.

All I know is the massage started off so promising before the legit customers came in.'

Many thanks as always for reading! (review of Monique's sensual massage at Kogarah Bay to come soon).

Person’s name: Paula.

Establishment: Ally’s Health and Beauty Centre. Shop 3, 175-181 Oxford Street, Bondi Junction
Date of visit: November 2015.

Contact details: 02 9387 7199; 0411 798 787.

Hours of business: As above.

Rates: $60 for a one hour massage.

Age: Early 20s.

Size and shape: Size 8ish.

Ethnicity: Thai.

Services provided: Remedial massage.

Value for money / recommend. Recommend only if you’re in the area and want a standard therapeutic massage.


Just not sure about this place. This being my second punt at Ally’s, which concluded like previously noted here. Started with a terrible phone conversation with an Asian lady. I called and asked her who was working… I can’t repeat everything as her English was very, very poor and it was a painful conversation. In short, I was expecting to meet an Italian woman named Clara or Tara for my booking – I was met in the room by Paula from Thailand. I asked about the Italian girl as mentioned, “We don’t have”. Brilliant. I only mention this because on both occasions I’ve been here, I’ve over heard a customer walk in and ask for their booking, to be told “they not here”. Pain-in-the-asshole!

So, onto the massage. Paula is very conversative with her massage. In the past I have had great legit massages that I’ve enjoyed, but this falls into the standard, nothing to write home about category. Maybe the fact who I was planning to meet wasn’t there as told to me, got this off to a disappointing start. Paula is a nice young woman and very professional. 

I did ask about a more sensual massage and she wanted nothing to do with it – a contrast to my initial visit. I won't be back for her, but my pursuit to find the stunning brunette I saw a couple of weeks ago will keep me coming back!

Hours of business: Contact Ally's (I think it is roughly 10am-7pm 7 days a week).

Rates: $60 for a one hour massage. $20 for a hand job.

Age: Early-20s.

Size and shape: 5'3", 55kg, dress size 8, short black hair, brown eyes, B-cup breasts, looked a little like Butch's girlfriend out of Pulp Fiction (1994), here: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com...f3f908a550.jpg

Ethnicity: Chilean.

Services provided: Remedial massage, hand job, groping, kissing on neck, etc.

My experience / comments: Rung up the Papasan to find out who was on. He mentioned a Barbara from Chile so thought I'd head in and try her.

Requested a firm massage and Barbara basically interpreted this as sticking her elbows into me as hard as she could. The massage was OK, but she isn't that good at remedial massage.

She moves down to my legs and bum and I lift my hips off the table giving her access to my junk. She got in nice and close with lots of brushing.

I flip over and she gets extremely close to my balls. I remove the towel. She doesn't mind. I begin stroking. She doesn't mind. So I'm stroking away for about five minutes, her smiling, me smiling, just a really good vibe. She whispers to me that she will stroke me for $20. I oblige. She locks the door and begins giving me an above average hand job.

This is where it gets fun. I sit on the edge of the table and she is all like "wtf?" I begin kissing her neck which she enjoys. Things got pretty heated and for more money I think she would provide cbj (if you bring the condom) or even fuck?

Anyways, I blow, give her the $20, and am on my way.

Barbara is a really fun and naughty girl. No good at massage, but if you click with her I think she will go a little further.

I had a 1 hour massage with the young Cambodian woman recently. A standard therapeutic massage was had, no HJ offered nor did I ask as the massage was anything but sensual.

Won't be back for her.

Person’s name: Zoe.

Establishment: Ally’s Health and Beauty Centre. Shop 3, 175-181 Oxford Street, Bondi Junction (located in Royal Arcade opposite St. George Bank in the Mall).

Date of visit: November 2015.

Contact details: 02 9387 7199; 0411 798 787.

Hours of business: Contact Ally’s (I think it is roughly 10am-7pm 7 days a week).

Rates: $60 for a one hour massage. $50 wanted for a hand job (i paid 20).

Age: Early-20s.

Size and shape: 5’7-8?, dress size 8, blonde

Ethnicity: French.

Services provided: Remedial massage, hand job, groping.

My experience / comments: As Cartman mentioned previously, Zoe is an attractive young French woman with the cutest of accents. But, unlike Cartman… I got a HJ   This was first visit to Ally’s Health. I wasn't expecting a HJ, so I'm inclined to think when getting one, made the experience more enjoyable. 

The massage itself is very good and she a lovely person to chat to. Over all the massage is not sensual in anyway. Her hands went down part of my ass crack, but it wasn't erotically done. I turned over as she requested and she kept the towel over the jewels. I was getting bored and asked her to massage closer to my groin which she didn't hesitate to do, however not sensually done. She kept her hands there – more nudging than massaging. Out of boredom, I lift the towel to reveal my balls, and ask her with a smile if she can massage them. To my surprise, she nodded with a cheeky smile, turned around to get more oil and poured it over my balls and softly applied both her hands to massaging them. I sheepishly pulled the towel up further and as I did, her hands followed to the point where her right hand was now fully stroking my cock. She proceeded to give me, sadly, an average HJ. It was enjoyable for the most part due to the surprise and her allowing me to grope her ass, and it's a nice firm ass.

After all was completed. She then said $50 for the HJ. I said 'Sorry, I don't have 50, just got 20'. Thankfully she smiled with no issue, and accepted. Knowing it's $50 it doesn't make me want to go back as her HJ was average, at best.

Person’s name: Anna.

Establishment: Ally’s Health and Beauty Centre. Shop 3, 175-181 Oxford Street, Bondi Junction (located in Royal Arcade opposite St. George Bank in the Mall).

Date of visit: February 2016.

Contact details: 02 9387 7199; 0411 798 787.

Hours of business: as above.

Rates: $60 for a one hour massage

Age: Early-20s.

Size and shape:  Size 10-12, brown eyes, C-cup breasts.

Ethnicity: Colombian.

Services provided: Remedial massage, with teasing.

Value for money / recommend. Yes, however…

My experience / comments: Felt like a legit massage, with the possibility of something more. Anna is a pleasant girl and comes across similar in nature as Cartman described Angela previously. Both Angela and Anna work Saturday's. Now, onto the massage. It was very relaxing with long strokes. Very soothing and when I asked her to concentrate around my groin while i laid face down. She didn't hesitate with slow hand movements close to my balls, yet, without touching them. So, I asked politely for her to get closer – again Anna obliged and massaged the no-mans area between my balls and asshole. I thought time was ticking over and asked for turnover, she abruptly said "ok" and walked out. I thought wtf. She returned with  warm towel and wiped my back. On turnover she covered my erection and proceeded to massage my legs. I asked her to continue as before and she massaged my groin with non stop brushing against my balls – long strokes, to the point she was massaging onto my balls. It was fucking great, until… I asked for HJ. Abruptly she replied 'If you want that, I will leave'. I wanted to say... "you've been massaging my balls for 15mins now, and now you're getting annoyed?" – I bit my tongue and I calmed the situation and made light of what she was doing.

In summary, she teased the hell-outta-me and even said "It was fun" without offering a HJ, cheeky bugger. The interesting part was she said they have one lady who gives HJ each day. The only two she knows are the middle-aged Hong Kong woman (forgot her name) and the very cute French une fleur, Zoe. Which i can confirm – see my previous post.

My experience / comments:

Anna: Feeling horny and reading someone's review above of Anna above on the train I called up and she was on. I thought more may be on offer so I headed in. Anna's massage gets right in close to your package. Lots of accidental brushing of your balls - even massaging your taint. However, when you ask for extras she storms out of the room (wtf?). Anyways, I'm left there horny as fuck so when Anna re-enters with the hot towels to wipe me down I ask her to send in a girl who provides extras. In comes Nada...

Nada: Nada was a hoot. Very fun-loving and cheeky. For the half hour we switched between me stroking myself and her stroking me. Nada tells me time up is approaching so I shoot my load and feel much better.

This was a very ad hoc visit and I was unsure if I had more than $100 cash in my wallet. Anna's massage was 60min/$60, Nada's massage was 30min/$35. I open up my wallet and only had $100 and could only give Nada a $5 tip. She was cool with this. I will be back to see Nada again to 1. Give her more of a tip, and 2. See if she will go further.

Thanks as always for reading.

Person's name: Victoria

Establishment: Ally's Health and Beauty Centre. Shop 3, 175-181 Oxford Street, Bondi Junction (located in Royal Arcade opposite St. George Bank in the Mall).

Date of visit: May 2015.

Contact details: 02 9387 7199; 

Hours of business: Contact Ally's (I think it is roughly 10am-7pm 7 days a week).

Rates: $40 - 40 min

Age: Early-20s.

Size and shape: 5"8, fit and very athletic body, blonde hair. 

Ethnicity: Eastern European

Services provided: Massage


Victoria is a new girl at Allys, l believe she has been there for about a month. Friendly chatty girl and willing to flirt a little. 

Good, strong rememdial massage on my back. No hints of sensuality though. Covered the whole time.

Victoria holds the towel while l flip on to my back so she can work my front. I get a good look at Victoria and she is farking hot. Very pretty face and a athletic, gymnast build - with arms that could probably rip my cock off! 

Towel stays covering my piece while she works my legs and thighs. She gets in close but no touches over the towel. 

She progresses to my stomach giving it slow strokes. I'm now at full mast while she's working my lower stomach just missing my member. It pops from the towel and she lets out a giggle, pointing to it asking if l can move it so she keep massaging!

Funnily enough l did not get a vibe from her that she would be willing to provide extras. I briefly asked if people ask for HJ's and she mentioned people ask for it without actually confirming if she does it.

Worth a massage though and she is quite a pretty girl.

Had a massage with Anna. I don't like reviewing legit services so will give a summary. It was a fully legit massage. No teasing like previous report and not even accidental brushing of balls. I thought her massage was good though and even fell asleep for a second. 
Anna is married so I don't think even regular customers will get extras.

Person's Name : Zoe

Establishment : ally's Bondi 

Date of Visit : April 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 9387 7199

Hours of Business : 10-7:30

Rates : $60/hr

Age : mid 20's

Size/shape : size 6-8

Nationality or Ethnicity : French 

Services Provided : massage, hj

Value for money/recommend? : yes

My experience/comments: 
Zoe is as described above and I was happy to see her. Surprised to see a girl like this working in a small shop. She was wearing tight jeans and t-shirt which showed off the body nicely without revealing anything. 
The massage was very good but more of a Swedish massage that you get at a beauty salon instead of a remedial massage. Just wanted to see how things panned out and didn't want to specify a remedial massage incase she got he impression I didn't want extras. No teasing or accidentlal brushes. Turned over and she started on my legs and didn't seem to be going anywhere soo popped the question of a hj and she said yes for $30 straight up. Didn't want to haggle as noted that she asked for $50 in previous reports. HJ was good with a with double handed action and she cleaned me up afterwards. 
Zoe is nice to chat to and spoke throughout the massage. She actually has a bf. Some guy came in asking for her during the massage and she knew who it was as she doesn't like him but he always requests her. Noise travels through the doors quite easily with all doors very close to rune front desk. You can always Hera female customers too so have to keep it quiet. We finished 5 min early so she could sneak home before he came back. Was paying Johnson and she rushed out saying bye to the boss. She went out and then stuck her head back in to say bye to me. She's a very nice person.
Now to try Victoria

Called up the papasan and got the run through of the roster. Vicky was available so l booked her for a hour. 

Vicky walked in and l had a good look. Average looking, 5'5 and in reasonable shape. Looks too be of Thai origin but she told me she was born in Aus. Probably early 30's. 

Stripped bare and Vicky massaged my back without a cover. Average massage on my back. Flipped over and Vicky left me bare for a good minute while she arranged a pillow. 

No tickle tackle or sensuality on the front as she works my legs. Popped the question at the end and she was a bit sheepish and unsure, eventually l worked out she would do it, but only for a significant amount - $50.

Arranged over the phone a 30 minute session with a Brazilian gal called Claudia. 

Greeted papasan and was led into a room. Claudia rolled in and she was a pleasant looking girl. Probably late 30's with a nice figure. 

I chatted with Claudia while she worked on my back. Quite a pleasant girl who has been in Australia for a few months. 

Flipped onto my stomach and Claudia massaged my legs and groin. A towel was loosely covering mainly my groin. No tickle tackle but she didn't avoid anywhere and got real close to my member which was erect.

On to my stomach and again she was massaging really close to my member without touching. At one stage she was pressing down on my chest with both hands kind of like when a girl rides you on top. I was short of cash so l didn't press for extras but she seems like quite a sexual, hands on person. 

Quite a sensual massage and l'm pretty certain extras would be available!

Thanks. I had a feeling it was her. Might have to check her out as I had seen her gumtree as before and thought she looked alright.
I was there 2 weeks ago to see Zoe again. Same service as I previously reported. Don't be pushy with this Zoe though and don't ask for too much. She mentioned she does like to see some customers and just says she's busy or another reason as they want things other than massage. She has a boyfriend so very unlikely to do more and a hj I think.

 Age: Late 20s?

 Services provided: Remedial massage + HJ 

 Value for money / recommend: Massage was alright, not the best l have had there, wouldn't see Anna again. 


Called in and booked the only available girl, Anna. I'm fairly certain l had seen her before, but l definitely hadn't asked for extras. l had read here that she's a flirt but not inclined for the more erotic activities.

Anna entered and pretty much blacked out the lights. Funny. Legit massage followed on my back and shoulders. Occasionally pressing her groin lightly into my dangling elbows. 

Anna then rearranges the towel so its length ways up my body. She tells me to flip and as you would expect the towel largely fell off leaving me fully exposed! The room was pretty much pitch black now as well after she adjusted the lights. I got her to work my chest and arms all the whilst my erect member was exposed. With 10 minutes to go Anna started massaging my abdomen going very close to my piece, often brushing it. Christ. I kind of notion for her to massage it without blatantly asking for extras. No mention of $. Some flirting back and forth and she then hastily lubes up my piece and gives me an inexperienced, quite awkward, rushed HJ before l blow a 1 week load. Gave her a $20. 

Anna's a nice friendly girl, but there are far better looking gals at Allys who'd l choose before.

Hi guys, I've had a really lean time of late.(financially that is) Based on a combination of Cartmans review, proximity to me and that she's Brazilian I booked to see Claudia.

All pretty stock, standard. Good, competent massage and no sign of any extras. The general formula for rates is $1 per minute.

I think she is attractive in a mature way and the conversation was pleasant. I will see here again for a massage only and to just sus out the general situation.

Oh I left my undies on, as per her instructions. Even with them on she held up the towel on the flip to protect my modesty presumably. No sign of any accidental brushes or tickles etc All very by the book. And yes, she id definitely the same provider (mentioned earlier) who offers mobile massage.

As always, if I have left anything out in terms of detail please let me know.

Age : late 20's

Size/shape : sz 8, thin, nice body but plain face

Nationality or Ethnicity : estonian

Services Provided : massage only

My experience/comments : was hoping to see Victoria again for a good massage but she had the day off. Told there was a new girl Trinna from Europe on but was currently busy. Booked for later without seeing her first. Johnson took me straight to the room and get ready and in walks Trinna. Blonde hair, nice body but plain face. She put the towel over me straight away. Asked about problem areas, any injuries like a qualified therapist before starting. She learnt massage back home and she seems to have a decent technique but wasn't hard enough despite saying I prefer firm pressure when she asked. Hands didn't come close to any fun parts and even used the towel when working on glutes so I would say there is no extras on offer. it was still a nice relaxing massage though.
It was her first day. She is working at another legit shop part time but isn't busy enough as it is very new so came here. Not sure what days or hours she will be working. 
Should have tried Claudia instead. Wouldn't go back for Trinna.

Date of visit: October 2016.

Contact details: 02 9387 7199; 0411 798 787.

Hours of business: Contact Ally’s (I think it is roughly 10am-7pm 7 days a week).

Rates: $60 for a one hour massage (it says out the front health fund rebates are available – although I didn’t get a receipt this time around).

Age: Mid-20s / early-30s? (it's sometimes hard to tell with Asians).

Size and shape: Pretty face, tall (i.e., 5'10"), 60kgs, dress size 10, great arse, A-cup breasts.

Ethnicity: Taiwanese.

Services provided: Remedial massage, hand-job, nude up, French kissing.

Value for money / recommend. Yes / yes.

My experience / comments: Elise was working behind the desk when I walked in. I thought she may have been the Mamasan. I inform her I would like a one hour massage and she leads me to a room.

Ordered to strip and told she will return.

She walks back in just as I'm taking off my underwear and didn't freak out - a good sign (I thought).

Face down onto the table and the massage is okay (nothing special). Keeps my bum and legs covered (bad sign).

Ordered to flip over and tell her my inner groin needs massaging. Elise (finally) started to loosen up a bit now.

Started massaging my balls, then cock, etc.

I asked her to nude up which she did (telling me it'd be an extra $50).

Things got fun here. She had the most awesome tan lines on her beautiful arse (she told me she plays beach volley ball). Lots of arse-slapping, deep French kissing, giggling, etc, a really enjoyable time.

I came, paid Elise, and was on my way.

Elise was slow to warm up but great fun once she did. Highly recommended for a (cheap) playful session.

Thanks as always for reading!

My experience / comments: "I'm a naughty girl" So she claimed, and compared to previous experiences here, I couldn't agree more.

Alice, not Elise, is physically as previously described by Cartman. Tall, very fit and has a great ass. Presumably achieved from her days of beach volleyball. She started the massage with a standard Remedial massage, until I told her I wanted a more relaxing massage – the mood changed instantly. She told me how much she loves giving sensual massage with her "sexy hands". The flirty, naughty girl came to life. $50 for nude was taken revealing a very fit body and that killer ass. 

I laid face down, with Alice climbing on top of me. Her hands slowly worked their way between my legs, giving me a great tease with massaging my balls. What followed truly surprised me – a nude body slide. Yep, at this place. I use to get these, back when i was a young’en thinking it was the shit. Very much over them, until this effort from Alice. After a short slide, she would lay herself flat on my back, rest her face on the side of mine, deep breathing with her one of hands between my legs teasing my balls. Very sensual, but more so, just damn sexy and genuine. I asked to turn over, Alice slide herself along my torso bringing her face so close, she drove her tongue deep in my mouth. She had me horny as hell – I tried to slide my dick inside her, making her laugh “You got condom?” she asked. No, i hadn’t. At least I know what is on offer in the future. I asked her to turn around and sit with her ass in my face while she jerked me off. She obliged, and I stuck my tongue in her ass. She leant back assisting me getting my tongue further into that fit ass, as well as one finger – she never flinched as her pussy got very wet and creamy. I couldn’t hold any longer hearing her moan and seeing her juices getting creamy as now my thumb was inside her pussy, and middle finger in her ass – I blew onto her stomach.

During clean up we had a great chat about life and sexuality . This girl is incredible fun, adventurous, confident and, loves sex.

Just a heads up on this joint. Ive recently seen a new aussie (greek background?) girl called Ravana, average looking. Excellent massage, one of the best ive had here, but declined on extras. Also seen a cambodian girl, Lina, also an average looking girl but another damn good massage but absolutely no extras.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 9387 7199

Hours of Business : 10-7pm

Rates : $60/hr

Age : 40s

Size/shape : Chinese, nice slender figure, ok face

Services Provided : massage + hj

Maggie has been here a while, seen her a bunch of times in the shop but not for a massage. 

She gave an excellent hard massage. Lots of her wrapping her legs around my dangling arms. Fairly certain something else was on offer. Flipped and she wanted to work my stomach. Slowly worked her way down until she was just about massaging my piece. Popped the question and she was happy to accommodate. Very nice hj from her soft, gentle hands. No mention of tips until she sheepishly asked me. Gave her 30 which seemed to make her happy.

Based on Cartman's review and recommendation, I decided to go visit Elise

Person’s name: Elise.

Establishment: Ally’s Health and Beauty Centre. Shop 3, 175-181 Oxford Street, Bondi Junction

Date of visit: Nov 2016.

Contact details: 02 9387 7199

Hours of business:  10am-7pm 7 days a week

Rates: $60 for a one hour massage

Age: Early-30s I think

Size and shape: Average looking face, at least 180cms, slim athletic build, A cup tits

Ethnicity: Taiwanese.

Services provided: Remedial massage, Hand Job in the nude

Value for money / recommend. Yes / yes.

My experience / comments: 
Made an appointment and was shown into the room and met Elise. She was somewhat surprised that I had booked her as she did not recall seeing me before. I mentioned that a mate saw her a few weeks back and booked based on his recommendation. My first impressions was that she is certainly very tall and with an incredible brown tanned skin with long dark wavy hair

I stripped off totally and laid face down on the table and we started a very good chat - basically a bit about me and what bought her to Australia from Taiwan. She is very easy to chat with and found out a bit more about her - beach volley ball is her passion and she plays it almost every day. So, she is incredibly athletic and explains the amazing tan. Her massage was very competent although she hasn't quite completed her course as yet. I was enjoying it and she started working on my legs and backside which started to get junior interested. I asked her if she did something a bit more sensuous - she was kinda surprised but composed her self quickly to tell me that a handy was $20 but I should definitely go for the $50 nude option. Who was I to argue and we went with that. Stripped off to reveal some lovely tan lines and pert A cuppers with nice bullet nipples. She gave junior some attention while I was still facing down and got him nice and hard. 

She then suggested that I flipped over....I was keen to lay eyes on her great physique. She didn't mind me playing with her clit but no fingers inside her and allowed me to suck on her tits as she tugged away. She had a nice rhythm going and soon had me spurting away. As I was leaving I said I should take a pic of that great ass and she happily modelled for me!

Enjoy her lads and treat her well. She also said she has just started working at Xclusive for a more erotic style massage for those that may be interested

Yep.

Her name is Ramoni and she is Italian.

Qualified beauty therapist with a Diploma of massage.

No. Extras. Whatsoever.

In fact she was the most diligent girl re: draping I've ever had at Ally's.

Popped in last Sunday and saw Vicky. Reviewed her earlier in the thread already. 

Didn't pursue extras so l'll keep it brief. Lots of contact and she left my piece fully exposed when she was working my legs. Lots of adjusting my piece aswell. 

Shes a reasonably attractive 30 year old girl with asian heritage and a thick aussie accent. Nice girl but not the brightest spark. 

Queried her about a HJ and she wanted $50 for it. I declined. Mentioned she was short of money aswell so l got the sense she would be down for other extras.

Could be worth a go.

Would have been very pretty 20 years ago. actually works at a legit shop a about 100m down spring street towards the eastgate centre entrance. Was not sure about a giving a hj so i didnt persevere. Quite hands on though and purposely grabbed my piece a few times while massaging

Saw a new girl today named elizabeth, from canada. She must have been at least 6ft tall and heavily built. Long blonde hair and seemed relatively pretty from what l could see in the dark light. I had a feeling she may be trans, could be 100% wrong but her size and height was something different! I didnt pursue or ask for extras and l got the impression they wouldnt be on offer as she was diligent with the towel at all times.

I did not get any extras so will not do a template review (I am happy to convert this post into such a review though).

Lois. Brazilian. Hottest masseuse I've ever had at Ally's.

Early 20s, 5'3", 50kgs, long black hair, C-cup breasts, dress size 8, thick Brazilian butt.

Didn't get extras but she massaged incredibly close to my junk. Even does that weird light touch thing all over your body masseuses do before the hand-job. I asked for a hand-job but she declined.

Not sure if she was cautious because it was my first visit.

Anyways, recommended for the great firm massage and the fact that a cute as fuck young Brazilian rubs her hands all over your body for a reasonable price. (even if nothing is on offer).

Hope this helps. Cheers.

Seen Lois/Lee twice now after Cartmans review. Quite pretty. Short and a curvy figure. Massage wasnt great and she was checking her phone during. Kind of feel like she thinks she can get away with shit service due to being a better than average looker.

As Cartman mentioned, interesting massage style which would give you the idea extras may be on the table. First time l saw her didnt ask about extras. Second visit l did. Not interested at all. Seemed somewhat offended. Wont be back to see her.

Well well old Johnson (papasan) fucked up today.

He owed me some money, so when l booked to see a girl today he upsold me, so he wouldnt have to give me change to the amount l gave him. 

30 mins in, of our agreed 40 min massage, the girl (pretty rank chinese bird) got the hot towel signalling the end of the massage. I told her there were 10 minutes to go which she replied no '40 mins over'. Screw it ill tell Johnson and get some cash back. 

Told Johnson and that it was ten minutes short, and he disagreed, some back and forth. It wasnt till ill showed him my call log proving l had been speaking to him in car at the time he thought the massage had begun.

He eventually agreed and handed some cash back. 

Told him he made a dumb fucking decision as l have been a very regular client over nearly two years. He chalked it up to a misunderstanding instead of him overbooking clients and being dishonest.

Its was only $10 but thats shit business, especially to a regular. Unlikely ill go back.

Date of visit: February 2017.

Contact details: 02 9387 7199; 0411 798 787.

Hours of business: Contact Ally’s (I think it is roughly 10am-7pm 7 days a week).

Rates: $60 for a one hour massage (it says out the front health fund rebates are available).

Age: Mid-20s.

Size and shape: Reasonably pretty face, 5'4, thin, dress size 8, B-cup breasts.

Ethnicity: Chinese.

Services provided: Remedial massage, hand job.

Value for money / recommend. No / no.

My experience / comments: Walked into Ally's and the receptionist said she would see me in 10 minutes. As I'm sitting there waiting Maggie walks into one of the rooms and makes eye contact with me and smiles - good start (I thought). I ask the receptionist can I instead see Maggie. Receptionist was cool and said no problem. Maggie comes and gets me and it's all down hill from there. Average massage (no firm pressure, etc). Flip over. I begin stroking myself. Maggie says she can do that. Lacklustre hand job ensued. I cum, tip her $20, and leave.

I'll of course be back to Ally's but won't be requesting Maggie.

Contact details: 02 9387 7199; 0411 798 787.

Hours of business: Contact Ally's (I think it is roughly 10am-7pm 7 days a week).

Age: Early-20s.

Size and shape: Attractive face, 5'3", 50kgs, long black hair, C-cup breasts, dress size 8, thick Brazilian butt.

Ethnicity: Brazilian.

Services provided: Remedial massage only.

Value for money / recommend. Yes / no.

My experience / comments: I overheard the receptionist say on the phone they have a 'Lois from Brazil' on. I request to see her and am told she will be available in 40 minutes. No problem. I wander around the Junction for a little while and return.

Receptionist shows me into a room and I'm told Lois would be with me soon. I strip down and am sitting on the edge of the table with a towel covering me and Lois enters the room, looks at me, and leaves, shocked (bad sign). LOL WTF? I was covered by a towel??? Anyways, I lay face down on the table covering my bum and Lois re-enters.

She starts a decent massage. Quite firm, just the way I like it. But, she keeps me covered (bad sign).

Lois has me in a position where we hold hands. She flirtatiously tickles them (good sign). When she is almost done with my back she begins lightly scratching all over my body (good sign). Much like masseuses do before they start to tickle your tackle.

I flip over and leave the towel off me. Lois makes sure to have her back to me. Turning around she is quite shocked and immediately covers me (bad sign). Massage finishes up, she does the light scratching on my front, and I ask for a hand job which she takes great offence to (bad sign).

Sounds like her service has gone down hill from Jonlad's post #64 above, so I won't be back to try to establish a rapport/get extras.

Shame. If this little hottie provided extras it would've been perfect for me. Oh well, not to be.

Person’s name: Alice (Uruguayan version).

Establishment: Ally’s Health and Beauty Centre. Shop 3, 175-181 Oxford Street, Bondi Junction (located in Royal Arcade opposite St. George Bank in the Mall).

Date of visit: April 2017.

Contact details: 02 9387 7199; 0411 798 787.

Hours of business: Contact Ally’s.

Rates: $60 for a one hour massage (it says out the front health fund rebates are available).

Age: 30.

Size and shape: Cute, 5'5, very fit athletic and tone. Killer south American butt 

Ethnicity: Uruguay.

Services provided: Remedial massage, slight sensual tease.

Value for money / recommend. Yes & no.

My experience / comments: Called up and only two ladies available first thing. Alice or Anna from Hong Kong. I said Anna as I was thinking it was Taiwanese Alice who i have seen, and wanted someone different. When I arrived there was a cute South American girl outside the shop with a killer ass talking on her phone. I entered the shop, saw Anna – unattractive middle aged Asian woman (with big titties) at the front desk. I asked if I could change my appointment to see the girl outside the door. No issues, all was good *phew*. She was introduced to me as Alice. 

She is a physiotherapist in a hospital back in her home country, Uruguay. And her massage is accordingly – therapeutic. Great girl, fantastic body, cute face and loves a good chat, but unfortunately offered no extras. In saying that she gave me the best therapeutic massage I've had this place. She mentioned, during her 3 months of working here, at first she was offended when asked to do a HJ, but she has come use to it. "Don't mix pleasure with business" she said. We got along really well and late in the massage i asked her to massage closer to my groin and she did with a cheeky smile, but reminded me no more was on offer. 

In summary, I would go back for a legit massage that has a subtle tease touch from a great and cute girl, but I wouldn't go back if I was in the mood for something more. 

On another note, I saw the Brazilian girl mentioned previously, damn she is cute…

Age: Mid to late 20s.

Size and shape: Attractive face, 5'3", 50kgs, long black hair, C-cup breasts, dress size 8, thick Brazilian butt. << As described by Cartman

Ethnicity: Brazilian.

Services provided: Remedial massage.

Value for money / recommend. Yes / Yes.

My experience / comments: I agree with Cartman, Li is the cutest I've seen at this place. To make it better, she is great person. We got along really well but-but-but!! as mentioned previously Li does not offer extras. Her massage is excellent IMO, perfect pressure and very therapeutic. Speaking of which, I did ask the manager who was best for a relaxing massage before arriving – wink-wink, nudge-nudge but he took my question literally with his suggestion for Li. As I was hoping for a sure thing for extra. Nope!

Not much need for details as extras are not offered, and my description of her massage is similar to Cartman. The soft running of her fingers and nails over the body before asking to turn over is the only part of the massage that gave me hope. Hope of a HJ and seeing that ass.... fuck me that's some quality South American booty. I also agree with Cartmans' statement if she offered extra she would be the perfect massage experience.  

That's two legit massages recently here from two damn cute and spectacular physique South American women to of little or no avail. Hands down this is the most inconsistent place I've been to. But yet, I'm not bothered by it. It has an element of surprise to it. I say this because of my (completely contrasting) incredible experience in the past with Taiwanese Alice.

Average looking face, slightly overweight, didnt even have a nice french accent as she has been here a while. Would have gone for one of the asian girls if i had seen her first.
Massage was ok though as she completed cert 4 and is doing diploma. Unfortunately, it was fully legit and not even any accidental contact as she stayed well away from the groin and glutes. She was even wearing the tafe polo shirt as she had to go to the tafe clinic afterwards to complete her hours.

My experience/comments : Got on the table uncovered and she came back and didnt cover me up so couldnt help but get excited thinking that there would be extras available. Her massage was poor even though she said she studied massage back in brazil. I asked for medium and it was still weak and poor technique. Her english is not too good either but knows enough to chat.
She went to get a towel and then said it was time to turn over while holding it up like a legit therapist and covered me up. I asked if it was ok to take it off and she had no issues. Massage continued on the legs and when she was almost finished on the 2nd leg, i popped the question if a HJ was available. She said sorry, she doesnt do that whilst having a bit of a grin on her face as if she was thinking "so you're one of those guys" She kept on going with the massage like nothing happened so that was good. 
She had no issue with me being nude and hard but didnt even work close enough to get any accidental brushes. Only see if you want to be nude Infront of a good looking girl.

On the way out, I got a glimpse of an attractive blonde scottish girl named Rogan who started recently.

The Asian girls do it.  Barbara from Chile is still there and I assume she still does extras as previously reported. 
The euro/south American/non asian girls don't appear to do extras apart from Barbara which is unfortunate as they are the more attractive ones. I think only 1 french girl did HJ in the past but she is long gone.

It's certainly looking that way.

Rogan from Scotland = no dice (and a bad massage).

Jacobine from The Philippines = no dice (although she gave a good massage).

In my opinion (or I'm hoping) when the Summer months roll around they get in some European or Latin American backpackers that provide extras.

(p.s. I'm happy to elaborate upon my non-sexual experiences with Rogan and Jacobine if anyone would like a further description. Cheers).

I picked Rogan for one hour and am shown into a room. The massage was quite poor (i.e., not firm when rubbing me down, or, too uncomfortable by her sticking her thumbs directly into my bones) and I'm covered by a towel the entire time. Flip over and she holds the towel up to cover me. Works on my front, doesn't get close to my balls, and the massage is over. I didn't ask for extras as I didn't want to push the 'scum bag' approach too much that day.

Rogan is an incredibly nice young woman who offers a poor massage. Extras may be on offer (but I personally doubt it) as she needs money to travel around Australia.

Anyways, I'm left with blue balls so ask Johnson to see Jacobine for 30 minutes.

I requested Jacobine to only work on my legs. No going close to my junk at all and I was covered the whole time. Jacobine was also in an incredibly shitty mood (hey, we all have bad days) so I didn't push for extras. However, her massage technique is great - firm without hurting.

I won't be back to see Rogan but will try Jacobine again. Also, as I mentioned above, I won't be back to Ally's until the Summer months are here (so hopefully some new backpackers will be in).

Ally's is a strictly therapeutic joint so scum bags like me can't complain when we don't get our rocks off there. However, the few dud punts I've recently had there do make me realise how much I took for granted gems such as French Zoe and Taiwanese Elise, etc.

Hopefully some new blood starts working here in the Summer months.

I hope the above information somewhat helps, and thanks as always for reading.

Thanks for the heads up Rogan Cartman. 

I won't write a full review as it was similiar to Cartmans experience. Shitty weak massage. Though l did ask about extras and she wasn't for it in the slightest. Has a partner her aswell so l hazard a guess it's a dead end.

Okay, so now the Summer months have rolled around I finished my self-imposed exile and returned to Ally's...

[Please note: Nothing strictly sexual happened below].

Person's name: Indie.

Establishment: Ally's Health and Beauty Centre. Shop 3, 175-181 Oxford Street, Bondi Junction (located in Royal Arcade opposite St. George Bank in the Mall).

Date of visit: December 2017.

Contact details: 02 9387 7199; 0411 798 787.

Hours of business: Contact Ally's (I think it is roughly 10am-7pm 7 days a week).

Rates: $65 for a one hour massage (it says out the front health fund rebates are available).

Age: Early-to-mid 20s.

Size and shape: Dark skin, quite attractive face, long black hair, 5'3, 50kgs, dress size 8, B-C cup breasts, great arse.

Ethnicity: Balinese.

Services provided: Remedial massage.

Value for money / recommend: Yes (although please note Ally's one hour massage has gone up from $60 to $65) / yes.

My experience / comments: I walked in and saw Indie and asked Ally when she would be available. Ally told me 30 minutes so I went and wandered around The Junction.

Upon my return I requested Indie for 60 minutes.

Into the room, onto my stomach, and Indie asked me if it was okay to remove the towel - of course!

Decent massage, flip over, and Indie covered me. I told her it was okay to remove the towel again but she declined - D'oh!

Indie got very close to my tackle when I was both on my front and back (but with no tickle).

I asked if she did extras which she declined. I then asked if I could stroke to which she declined (although she didn't mind me dry-humping the towel).

Longer story longer, Indie and I talked about a heap of shit, i.e., she is new to massage, is a beauty therapist by trade, she cannot believe the amount of guys who ask for extras but can understand why, she loves being a masseuse, etc - in my opinion she is a great young woman who may be open to extras as she becomes more experienced.

We finished up and I left quite happy with the above-average massage and good conversation.

On my way out I saw Colombian Lina kiss/hug another customer very intimately on his way out which makes me think she may provide extras - I'll definitely be returning to find out.

I hope the above information helps, and as always thanks for reading!

My experience/comments : Walked past to see who was on and there was a decent looking girl sitting in the waiting area. Jacobine and another girl were behind the counter. Asked to see Maria and taken to the room. Lied down nude and uncovered and Maria came in and covered me up straight away. There was draping for the whole massage and she was very professional about it. She even had the towel lengthways to cover most of my body. She did move it aside a little when she worked on the outer glutes but made sure to push the towel between my legs to cover the junk. All very legit and she said she worked in another shop which i know is fully legitimate and said she doesnt do any extras. Has only been here for about a few weeks and was a physical therapist in Columbia. The massage is ok. Long slow strokes with firm pressure and quite relaxing. Stayed well away from the groin.
Has only been here for a few weeks and is a physical therapist in Columbia. Got a hot towel to clean up but only did my legs and didnt bother with my back.

Person's Name : Faberini

Establishment : Ally’s Health and Beauty Centre. Shop 3, 175-181 Oxford Street, Bondi Junction

Date of Visit : January 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 02 9387 7199; 0411 798 787

Hours of Business : 10-7

Rates : $65/hr

Age : Mid 20's

Size/shape : size 7-8, attractive face with great body

Nationality or Ethnicity : Brazil

Services Provided : teasing massage only…however

Value for money/recommend? : yes/yes

My experience/comments : I've seen this girl a number of times in the waiting room and always been drawn to her, very attractive young woman always wearing tight yoga pants. I asked the old guy that works at reception for her name, Faberini from Brazil. I checked to see if anyone had seen her in the forum and  yes, one review and it wasn't a positive one… nevertheless, I wanted to give her a try as the women here can be quite inconsistent with the level of service offered to punters. 

In short, I was right. A fantastic sensual teasing massage.

Faberini hasn't the best English. She tries, but her lack of confidence is obvious. Her massage style is not shy. Towel was not used when laying on my stomach and she massaged my groin with a very slow firm strokes, without actually touching my goods. I thought I would wait for turnover before asking for a HJ. On turn-over Faberini placed the towel just covering my dong, revealing my balls. She continued to massage my groin with slow long strokes and some touches under my balls. I asked if the towel can be removed "sure" she replied. With this, she massaged all around my erect ding-dong driving me mental. So, I asked if she could massage my balls. "No, I don't do this." I asked would she for a tip? "No" she replied with a smile. From that point I left it.

Now comes the however part.

While wiping me with a hot towel at the completion of the massage, Faberini tells me she is aware of some girls doing HJ:

DB: some do, some don't, I'm reluctant to ask.
F: Yes I know. I'll do for 100 
DB: what?
F: no less
DB: wait, you will do?
Faberini holds one finger to her mouth directing me to be quite
F: Yes, for 100. It is not my job you know…
DB: why you tell me this now?!
Faberini laughs
F: You want?
DB: Next time.

$100 for a clothed HJ is steep. Yet, i was tempted as her massage strokes are fantastic when asking for a relaxing massage. She is an attractive woman IMHO and if you really want a HJ from a fit brazilian, then she believes you need to pay well for it.

Date of visit: February 2018

Contact details: 02 9387 7199; 0411 798 787

Hours of business: Contact Ally’s (I think it is roughly 10am-7pm 7 days a week)

Rates: $50 for a 45-minute massage

Age: Early-20s

Size and shape: 5’7”, 55kgs, dress size 8, B-cup breasts, long brown hair in a pony tail, fit body

Ethnicity: Chilean

Services provided: Remedial massage

Value for money / recommend: Yes / yes

My experience / comments: I was in The Junction so phoned up Ally’s to ask who was on. They said a few names then lastly a new Chilean girl named Mayana. I requested to see Mayana for 45 minutes.

I arrived and was greeted by Mayana who was wearing grey yoga pants and a sleeveless white top – fit girl and quite pretty.

Into the room and I requested my legs massaged only (I ran that morning and my legs were sore/tight).

Mayana told me to get undressed and jump under the towel on the table and left.

She re-enters with me on my stomach and uncovers one leg, massages, then the other, and requests me to flip over (she got right into the knots in my legs – great massage). However, there was no sign of tackle-tickle.

When I flipped she did grab a glimpse of my cock, but covered me up. She would’ve been able to see up the towel but no funny business occurred.

She did the fronts of my legs thoroughly and that was that.

Told me it was over and I left with my legs feeling like a million dollars.

My gut tells me Mayana will not be offering extras.

Cheers!

Well, we all know where can we get what we want and how much to pay for it. But there are times in life where you have to go against your own sets of values and pay up if you want to play down - if you know what I mean ? There is no way any RnT punter should pay $100 for just a HJ or even a nude HJ for that matter but there are times and places where you just have no choice and let the little head rule. 

Most recently I paid $50 for a clothed HJ in the Cross, no nude no touching, but I had no time to go else where and needed to shoot, that's all. And then there was this one time at Melbourne where the hot hot Korean girl wanted $100 for a part 2 and that was my only chance to have a punt in Melbourne (with my Mrs travelling with me) so paid up, but that was fully nude and BBBJ included, so it wasn't that bad. And then I swear to myself that I would never pay that price range in Sydney and then the KX punt came up and I ate my own words.

So if any one has been eying off to get those Brazilian hands on to your willy, I'll say go for it, no regrets, it will probably be worth it, just to say to yourself, yeap, I got her - it's priceless !!

Cheers

Contact details: 02 9387 7199; 0411 798 787.

Hours of business: Contact Ally's (I think it is roughly 10am-7pm 7 days a week).

Rates: $65 for a one hour massage.

Age: Early-20s.

Size and shape: 5'2", 50kgs, dress size 6-8, B-cup breasts, long black hair, brown eyes, dark tanned complexion, quite an attractive face. 

Ethnicity: Balinese.

Services provided: Remedial massage.

Value for money / recommend: Yes / no (if you are looking for sexual services).

My experience / comments: Nothing sexual happened.

Novi is an incredibly nice young woman who gave an excellent remedial massage. I'd give the massage 9-out-of-10. She was dressed in tight black pants and a t-shirt.

Was draped while on my stomach. Had my dick pointed down between my legs (which she would've seen). Definitely no tackle tickle or accidental brushing.

For the whole hour Novi only did my back, legs, arms, etc (very thoroughly). There was no flip over (which was a shame as I genuinely do like my thighs and chest massaged).

Anyways, great remedial massage with no funny business.

Contact details: 02 9387 7199; 0411 798 787.

Hours of business: Contact Ally’s (I think it is roughly 10am-7pm 7 days a week).

Rates: $65 for a one hour massage (it says out the front health fund rebates are available).

Age: Late-30s-to-early-40s.

Size and shape: Light skin, 5'5", 70kgs, dress size 10-12, C-cup breasts.

Ethnicity: Chinese.

Services provided: Remedial massage and hand-job.

Value for money / recommend: Yes / yes.

My experience / comments: I was in The Junction so decided to pop into Ally's.

I didn't call beforehand and was just allocated Jenny. At first I was a little disappointed as I like to try non-Asian backpackers here, but Jenny was well worth it.

Into the massage room and she begins a incredibly firm (bordering on painful) massage. Really good and got all my knots and kinks out. Her massage was so good and professional I thought she may not offer a hand-job.

Jenny moves to the legs and there's no tackle-tickle but she really gets up in between the thighs (a good sign). I lift my bum and little bit and she got right in there.

Flip over and she keeps me draped, but again, really got into my nooks and crannies.

Tackle-tickle started and she began stroking me.

Jenny didn't ask for a tip/negotiate the hand-job but I tipped her $20 before she left the room.

I'd recommend Jenny simply for her excellent massage. The hand-job was a bonus (and not knowing if I'd get a hand-job or not is always half the fun, too).

Person's name: Julie.

Establishment: Ally's Health and Beauty Centre. Shop 3, 175-181 Oxford Street, Bondi Junction (located in Royal Arcade opposite St. George Bank in the Mall).

Date of visit: June 2018.

Contact details: 02 9387 7199; 0411 798 787.

Hours of business: Contact Ally's (I think it is roughly 10am-7pm 7 days a week).

Rates: $65 for a one hour massage (it says out the front health fund rebates are available).

Age: Late-20s.

Size and shape: 5'8-9", 65kgs, dress size 8-10, long brown hair, B-cup breasts. Quite sexy in my opinion.

Ethnicity: French.

Services provided: Remedial massage and hand-job.

Value for money / recommend: Yes / yes.

My experience / comments: After seeing Julie in the waiting room on my visit to Jenny (see: review above) I wanted to try her as she appeared to be a cheerful young woman (and her French-ness was enticing, too).

I called up beforehand and asked who was on. I was told Julie so booked her in. Julie was dressed in tight black yoga pants and a tight black tee.

Into the room and I stripped and lay face down on the massage table (not bothering to cover myself). Julie entered the room and didn't seem to mind but covered me anyway to begin the massage.

Her massage (with the towel covering my back and bum) was quite firm and felt good. While she was pressing down on my bum one of her fingers was not shy to poke around my arse crack (a good sign that more could be on offer).

She takes away the towel and applies the oil to my back in a slow and sensual way. Her massage is excellent with lots of long flowing strokes  similar to a Kahuna massage. But also at times quite firm which is good for remedial purposes.

Julie finishes on my back and moves down to my legs. She begun by not getting overly close to my junk so I thought that extras may not be on offer. However, when she moved onto my other leg she begun to get up in between my thigh and balls. I lifted my bum and she got right in there, teasing, but not brushing my shaft.

Asked to flip over and if I wanted a hand-job - of course I said yes. I was told it would be an extra $30 which was no problem. Hand-job was decent and she was sure to ask me if I wanted it slower or faster, softer or firmer.

I asked Julie how much for her to nude up but she told me she doesn't do that. Not to worry. As she was stroking me Julie didn't mind me groping her bum but didn't allow any inside touching. However, she really got into it pushing onto my hand, etc.

Blew, and Julie finished off giving me a head massage (always a nice touch).

From memory I was certain I only had a $50 note in my wallet and I wasn't sure if she'd pull the 'oh I don't have any change' line. Fortunately (and in line with her genuine and fun-loving nature) she went and got me change from her purse. Always a nice touch just on principle.

Conclusion: Ally's (unfortunately) has been more miss than hit over the past 12-18 months with the non-Asian backpacker types and I was considering no longer visiting here. My visit with Julie has restored my confidence that there are still European and / or Latin Americans working here who will do extras and genuinely enjoy a bit of cheeky good-natured fun.

I'll definitely be back to visit her.

Not a proper review as no extras were recieved. Read Cartman's report on Julie and called to hear another french girl on named Lucy. I booked her unseen hoping she was friends with Julie and did extras. Walked into the shop and she was waiting and ready. Got on the table nude and uncovered but she got the towel to cover up and talking to her, it was obvious she wasnt going to extras. Holds the towel up to block her view when you turn over and makes sure to avoid accidental contact. She did give a good massage and she has had some proper training.  If i was only after a massage, i would see her again.

Size and shape: overweight,

Ethnicity: Brazil

Services provided: massage only

Value for money / recommend: ok

My experience / comments: Tried to get a massage with Julie but she was not available. Told there was a new brazilian girl so made a booking and turned up but she was running a little late. While waiting, 2 female customers came out and one was also waiting.
Met Lily and first impression was that I wouldn't have picked her if I had seen her. Not attractive and a bigger girl. Seemed nice enough during initial chat. 
Was able to get an undraped massage with no issues. The massage itself was better than average for this place. Used decent pressure and asked if it was ok and if I wanted it harder. I think she has more of a swedish massage background but Johnson has told her to use more pressure. 
Turned over and didnt require the towel to cover. As she got to the upper thighs, I asked the question about hj. There were 1 or 2 accidental bumps of balls when she was working on my back but she said she doesn't do it. As she continued on upper thighs, the back of her hand was brushing my balls. This was not accidental. I am unsure about Lily. Maybe more visits will get a hj but it wasnt happening this time and I'm wasn't impressed enough to try her again.

My experience/comments :
Back to one of my irregular favs, Allys Health. Rang the shop and asked who was on, and thought I might as well try the Korean girl , Sally. I'm sure that was her name as sometimes the owner I can't understand. Anyway, I was happy when she walked in as she is very cute. Really tight body size 7-8 I'm guessing. She asked where to concentrate to which I said my back and legs. Good start with no towel placed on me. Her hand strokes are fantastic, long and firm and slow strokes. I was getting my hopes up. I timed ticks over her hands were not getting 'close enough' to get me confident a HJ was on. I'm never one to push it. It was a great massage with some great subtle teasing. Interesting enough, on the front, Sally placed a small towel over the jewels and rubbed with fast strokes for a bloody long time on the towel giving me a raggggging boner.


In summary, I really enjoyed this legit, yet tantalising massage.

My experience / comments: After seeing, Cartman's review I thought I would give Julie a crack. Maybe her style has upgraded or is evolving because she didn't hesitate to tease me. She is an attractive woman with a tight-toned body. Couldn't help but think she is a regular yoga participant… whatever that means. 

On to the massage shall we. It started very therapeutic with towel placed over my ass and legs while she spent approx 20mins on my back, even though I requested to focus on the legs. Safe to say she has her routine. As described by Cartman her strokes are long and flowing with a sensual touch – not as obvious as the Chinese girl I reviewed previously. Onto the legs and initially I thought no extras were coming as she did the dreaded one-leg reveal towel move. In my experience, when a masseuse only reveals one leg at a time, it's strictly legit. The strokes were firm and long and stayed away from the goods. 

Then, suddenly her pressure changed to being very subtle and just like Cartman mentioned her hands got very close, actually she brushed softly against my balls once she started to massage my groin. I raised my ass off the table a little and her hand got in there – a lot. It was on like Donkey Kong! She took her time with flowing strokes brushing the side of my balls to the point she was massaging only my balls. She cupped them with one hand for at a good 5mins never releasing them, applying amazing pressure. Then, again, slowly using her skills to crawl one finger down my shaft – almost patting it like you do under a cats chin. It was driving me mental, deliberately not going all the way down.

On turn over, she said extra is $30 – sure, ok I said. What I got was a ridiculously insane tantric style HJ. The teasing and pace of it was something else. She massaged my balls with amazing detail before working her hands up and around my shaft long before she commenced the HJ. I can't remember if I have ever received a HJ like this one before. The pace and touch was timed to perfection, not to mention the tweaking of my nipples as well. I placed my hand on her great ass which was accepted, but I didn't ask to take off. I'm going to wait for my upcoming visits to pursue. 

After completion, I asked her if she does tantric massage, to which she confirmed she did. To get that quality of teasing and sensual (tantric) massaged at $65 an hour is incredible value. Julie, works Friday and Saturday I believe.

My experience/comments : 

I had previously seen Julia at Crows Nest and dropped in here and saw that she was free. I asked for more tantric massage but it ended up being similar to her previous massage. Starts off as normal massage with a towel covering even though i lied down naked without it.  Spends a good amount of time spent on back and shoulders. Didn't start getting the "accidental" touches until after half way through. Does the legs and grabs your cock from underneath while still lying face down. Turn over and she doesn't massage the front of your legs and goes straight into the tantric part. Takes her time and doesnt try to make you cum as fast as she can. It was pretty much the same massage i got from her first time even when i asked for more tantric.  https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f60/l...64/#post299964

Appears she has left Ally's and is only at the Crows Nest shop where she seems to charge more

My experience/comments :

Range Johnson the boss man to see who he would recommend for a firm massage as I was in need of some relaxation. He confirmed Julie the french girl had left the shop but had a girl from Chile who was good. So, took a punt and signed up for an hour massage. Was introduced to her and she was quite dark, ring on her nose and reasonable pretty. I went into the room and took off everything and laid face down, she didn't bother with draping the towel over me which I took as a good sign. She has been at Ally's for a month and was trained with a Cert 4 in remedial massage. She did quite a good job and got me to relax but alas, no accidental brushing. Anyway, she then asked me to flip and again, no towel to cover up junior and she commenced on my legs and started to work up my thighs. I got a semi erection at this stage and I asked her of she would provide me with a HJ, but unfortunately her reply was that she doesn't do that. So, I just closed my eyes and enjoyed the rest of the massage....

Worth it if you want a good massage and she doesn't mind you being in the nude.

Note the name "Johnson" and the mob number 0411798787.... funny if it weren't so flippant...

Ally's is advertising on Gumtree for massage workers ....just so you know the Commission is $35/ hour.... that means the extras will be what keeps these girls alive... $35/ hour working is slavery... Closer to the minimum wage of $17.50 an hour.... Chances are looking good for the workers to grab more than the commission rate... btw massage starts at $80/hour so best pack a pineapple and a couple of lobsters for extra opportunity...

My experience/comments: Called Johnson and was told a French girl named Marina was on. Selected her. Into the room and told to strip down. Jumped on the table starkers face down and didn't cover myself. Marina didn't either when she entered. Excellent firm massage but no getting into my nooks and crannies. Flip over and covered but my dick did slip out a few times. As such, an enjoyable CFNM experience but still didn't get close to Junior. Popped the question and got a "no". Such is life.

Establishment : Allys

Date of Visit : July 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As above 


Rates : $55 /45

Age : 30s

Size/shape : Short, petite

Nationality or Ethnicity : China 

Services Provided : Teasing Massage 

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Dropped by to see some mates in Bondi and decided to head for a massage after. Had read some good/mixed reviews for Allys so checked it out. I was a walk in and had to wait alongside a female customer standing outside the shop for her ML as the two inside seats were taken. This is going to be interesting. Johnson (classic) advised only one ML was available due to the other customers. 

Anyway... eventually got in to the room. Took my clothes off while Li waited in the room. I asked about underwear and she signalled take off so I thought righto, we're in. She was wearing short denim shorts and a loose t'shirt too. Always a good sign for hopefully easy access. The room was the small one on the right hand side and so I laid down and she began a firm massage. The massage was actually excellent - great technique and pressure. She spent a lot of time on my glutes, lower back and calfs. She had me covered in a towel which was strategically placed most of the time. I had said it was OK to remove but she politely said it was better to stay on... 

Anyway, as she kneaded my glutes there was a bit of tackle bumping happening and I was rising to the occasion a little though she ignored it at this point.  After 30 she asked me to flip and lent down and whispered in my ear "do you want a head massage"... I was like which head and she giggled and literally started a head massage. Was I getting mixed signals? Anyway by that stage I had flipped and the towel was standing on a tentpole. I slid the towel off twice but she put it back over. 

I asked about extra and she said no, female customer in next room. She gave my member a few squeezes though and lent down and kissed my pelvis before finishing up. So an exercise in teasing but a good massage. I didn't want to push things though as she was nice and friendly. So we cleaned up and walked out. As i walked past the door with the female customer I could hear her moaning... the mind boggles. As I left Johnson winked at me and said come back later in the day when there are less customers from the hairdresser across the hall about! Ha. I'll keep that in mind next time.   I will return.

As the reviews of Ally's illustrate, this place can be hit or miss.

Was passing recently and there looked like a mamasan on the phone and one asian lady seated. On entering, the asian lady quickly stood and led me to one of the rooms. I asked if the massage would be full body with my hand over my crotch and she nodded and disappeared.

I began to undress. She knocked and came in and watched whilst I undressed. As I was getting onto the table she was holding a towel and I said that that was not necessary.
What followed was 20 minutes of medium massage. It was very relaxing; almost nodded off. Plenty of inner thigh work but no TT.

On the flip, she started on my lower legs and gradually moved up with massage of my inner thighs and then my scrotum. This proceeded to gentle massage of the penis with a more forceful grip as I grew.

The great thing was there was no rapid fire tugging with the sole purpose of a quick finish. She massaged at a steady pace with gradations in pressure. There was no resistance to putting my hand under her dress and gripping her small buttocks. She was wearing tights which made any further access virtually impossible. It will be interesting to return when the weather warms up.

At the end she washed me down with a hot towel. After dressing I offered $20 which was gratefully accepted with a smile and thank you and on the way out payed the mamasan $40 for the half hour massage.

I will be back.

Went in and chatted to Johnson who was at the desk.  Sherry was next to him at the desk.  The other girls were all head down on their phones.  Sherry was the only one who looked up and smiled so I chose her.  She has a little bit of a bad complexion but not ugly.

Took me into the room and a i lay down undraped.  She then proceeded with quite a good massage on my back and legs.  Halfway through there started to be quite obvious tackle tickle.  My hands drifter to her butt and there was no resistance.  Started pulling down her tights, no resistance.  So I lifted my butt and she reached under started a HJ.  She asked me to flip over started a nice long slow hj.  one of the best I had.  She let me take off her bra and she had small boobs with perky nipples.  they were very sensitive but she was ok with me fondling her boobs.

The tights came off and I was allowed outside access to her pussy.  A bit hairy but very wet.  Lay her down on the bed and started rubbing her pussy for a while.  She gripped my cock hard as I was doing this and she softly moaned and writhed till she orgasmed.  We swapped places and then she continued her HJ till I blew.

Had some time left so she cleaned with a hot towel and wipes and then gave me a good foot massage.

All in all a good 45 mins - tipped her $35 and she was happy

Value for money/recommend: No/no

My experience/comments: Ailin is a new masseuse here so I decided to book her in. Her massage was okay. I’d say 6.5/10.

I knew nothing would be on offer as even when Ailin began the massage with the large bath towel covering me she didn’t even massage my glutes.

No hint of extras.

Didn’t even allow me to flip over and massage my front (extras or not if you pay for a 45-minute massage you should get your front massaged).

Nice enough girl. However, no front massage sees me not booking her again.

My experience/comments: Was in need of a massage so popped in here. Jan is incredibly cute so I selected her. Into the room and she's happy to provide the massage undraped while you're lying on your stomach. Jan will get incredibly close to your junk without touching it. Flip over and she covers you, again getting incredibly close. I ask if she provides a hand-job to which she replies "no" (but is happy for you to finish yourself). Nice young woman, decent massage, but no funny business by her.

Hi All,
I went to 314 Oxford Street a couple of weeks ago. 
I paid $60.00 for the half hour massage. I went at about 11 am and it was fairly busy but they seem to have enough girls so I didn't have to wait. All the girls are asian (Thai?). My massage was given by an older lady (maybe 40 years old... hard to say). But they seem to have a range of girls of various ages.

It was a fairly basic rub and tug... worth the money but that's about all. The room was dingy, small and dark with thin walls so you could easily hear the conversations in the adjacent room.

Overall, it was a basic no frills experience.

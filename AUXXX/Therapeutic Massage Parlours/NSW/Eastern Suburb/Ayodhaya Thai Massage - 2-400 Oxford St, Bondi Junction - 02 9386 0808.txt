Dropped into this joint last week.

Tried to get in and the front door was locked, buzzed several times to no avail. Ended up calling them saying I was waiting outside (across the road), they apologised and said they were busy. Come in now.
Went in unusual set up reception area (no seats ) a couple of rooms off to each side. Was ushered into a room, and asked how long I wanted. Being the first time I opted for 30 min to suss out the action. Was told to get undressed and was led to a pod style shower set up in the kitchen area ( with obligatory rice cooker).
Returned to the room (Facing Newland - Shop front blocked out by a large sticker & curtain), quite small & stuffy (no air con) but fan on full bore.
The girl who greeted me returned to service me. No the most attractive girl (Thai) hot bod, high heels (tick) asked if I was aware what went on here. I took a punt and said yes. 
She oiled me up and started massaging, as the time went on, she started losing clothes, top followed by skirt- things were looking good now. She was massaging from my head down and I had my hands holding on to the table she then grabbed them and placed them on her ass (double tick). Soon enough it was time to turn over.
By which time bra & panties were on the floor, she then positioned herself beside me facing my legs and bent over enough to set a good view of her snatch. I obliged by massaging her slit while  she was going to work on me, as things progressed she started moaning and it was all over for me.
Jumped into the shower and on the way out saw the other girl who was working there, who was hot. May be another visit is needed.
A little bit stuffy, and right next to the station. $60 for 30 min.
Cheap & Cheerful.

anyone been here lately? went here for a massage the other day. i got a very attractive thai girl - not super skinny, but a good size with massive cans. i didnt go for a punt but when I turned over she was massaging around my groin region in a sensual way. i had a massive hard on. i could see her sneaking some peaks at me to see my reaction. although i did not ask for more i sensed there may have been more on offer. interested to know if anyone else has had a similar experience...

this place is now called Ayodhaya Thai Massage.

Hi james-s,

What was her name? It may be worth testing whether this is really a legit place.

Thanks,
Bartok

I was there a week and a half ago and had a great standard thai massage, though I left the underwear on and didn't try to suggest anything as I had been left disappointed with the massage quality from rnt places and wanted a proper massage. I left quite happy with the quality of the massage so I'd recommend them on that basis alone.

My experience/comments: Having been left high and dry by Ailin at Ally’s, here, I decided to pop into Spring Retreat who had no availability. Horny as all hell wandering around The Junction I decided to see if the Beauty Wax Bar where I’ve gotten a Brazilian Wax before, here, offered massage. They don’t, however, they share an entrance with Thai Massage Time.

I was glad I visited.

Was greeted by Amy who showed me into a quite small massage room. There were a lot of legit Thai massage items lying around so I was unsure if this place offered extras (there were also tissues, baby oil, etc, so there was at least a 50/50 chance).

Amy told me to strip down and exited the room.

I jumped on the table with my cock pointing down between my legs and Amy re-entered.

She began massaging my legs undraped and and her massage technique is excellent. Amy is definitely a qualified masseuse.

About 5 minutes in the ‘accidental’ bumps on my cock began.

Sure enough she popped the question of do I want a hand-job. Her going rate is $50 and she wouldn’t budge down to $20. No worries, she let me finish myself.

Things got pretty heated and I think more could be on offer in the future (at the right price) with Amy.

p.s. It was pretty hot knowing that you are in ear-shot of a 100% legit beauty salon (i.e., Beauty Wax Bar) while getting wild with a masseuse. (The set-up is hard to explain. Those who have visited/will visit this place will understand).

It used to advertise as Body Key also. Have had some good and some frustrating times here! On balance a good place.

Value for money/recommend?: Good massage and happy ending

My experience/comments
Had seen the ad on the local weeklies for this place and planned to visit it. Booked an appointment for an hour and asked if there were extras on the menu. Lady on phone with a Chinese accent states that you come over have very young ladies. Took that to be a positive and worst case scenario might just end up with a good massage.
Rocked up at appointed time and was shown into one of the rooms clean massage table and paid up for massage. other women were all busy so ended up with Coco and don't regret that decision. Lovely body with a little baby fat and big boobs.

So off she goes out and asks me to undress and lie on bed. Starts a really good massage with her hands then puts a towel on my back and using her legs and knees kneads into my back and let me tell you this was fantastic my back was so free and open. Moves to legs and then asks me to turn over. Starts chatting and massaging legs moving up gradually and playfully touching. 

Asks if I want anything else and I ask what else is on offer - offers HJ and I ask her to remove her clothes also for extra. Removes them slowly all the while playing with my erection. Fantastic body and lovely natural tits with nipples pointing up. Ask her for bbbj or even cum on body and she says not today boss is in. Does not mind me touching her body or playing with her pussy with my finger. All this while she has been gently massaging my penis and slowly and gradually she gets me over the line. She has a fantastic technique with both her hands she massages my balls and runs the other hand over the penis and it was just a great feeling. Pipes cleaned and she then dresses up and gets a hot towel to clean me down. 

Will definitely return especially for the massage.

Dropped in today while visiting Bunnings.

Saw Coco, I assume it is the same Coco as above, description matches, except she does not have huge tits, she has tiny tits but to biggest nipples I have seen.

$35 for 30min + $50 for nude and HJ.

Value, not the best.

Great back massage with hot towel to wipe off oil. Rolled over and no massage, just light teasing all over including tackle. Then Coco make the globally recognised sign fi HJ and holds up two fingers, then mimes taking off her top and five fingers. I confirmed that the 50 was for the lot, on top of the $35.

Good HJ and touching was allowed. All in all not a bad experience and I would return if in the area, but better value to be had in the Thai place, $60 for same service and nude from the start.

OK, firstly an apology, i said i'd TOFTT at 165 Canterbury Rd, but having read a few more details about it on syd99 decided against it, and therefore knew i'd have to make it up to my fellow punters by checking out another place.

Its a glorious Sydney day, and there is a $100 note burning a hole in my wallet, "what to do, what to do"....
So after a eenie, meenie, miynee mo... around AXR, decided to give 6/635 Gardeners a whack (so to speak)
Call and find out a Jo-Jo is available, and am VERY pleasantly suprised to find a very attractive tiny pocket rocket wearing 3/4 jeans and a singlet top at the counter asking me if Id like a massage. Being the ever-so-accommodating chap that i am, i agree and am led into one of the rooms, which has 80% height walls, but is clean, tidy and has mattress topped massage table in the center. (im liking this.... a lot, as some of the massage tables around the traps, are in no fewer words.... fucked. I whisper in her ear, how much, she whispers back $30 for half $60 for the hour... i asked Hand relief?.... i get the 2 fingers, so half is $50, hour $80,,,she can see me with a questioning look, how about naked, she says $120 hour $90 half massage  included, and we then agree the $100 would be for 45 minutes, naked with hand relief. 
She leaves, takes the money and i get ready on the table, she returns, cheeky smile, and starts to strip, revealing a tanned cute size 6 body, perky small tits, nice dark nipples and a trimmed, (not shaven) pussy, which after tickling it smelt like honey. Anyway, not to bore you all, my massage went for about 20 minutes, with her walking up and down my back, legs, and arms naked, then she comes down gets the talc and starts the tackle tickle, and crick tickle, while im trying to pry her legs open (its hard when youre face down, and shes positioned hertself at your ass), although she settles for me doing figure 8s over her clitoris while the tackle is getting tickled. 
Time for the flipside. 
I notice she also has a sore neck, and is trying to crack it, and in my usual form (if you've read my previous posts) decided to help her..., this was not as rewarding to me as usual, as it got me a discount on the next visit, and a truly thankful kiss on the cheek for making her better. Any way, she skillfully acted like she couldn't hear me when i asked her to slow down on the Relief, as i blew all the way up to my arm which was behind my head... (she's good)... she offered me a warm towel, finished with a head massage, and we finally were parting strangers... geez i love fridays...

I went here a few days ago and I saw the same coco as svkx and yes there was definitely more nipple than boob, long nipples, if aroused  it could be dangerous. 

Anyway the massage was really good and firm. The ending, happy as it was, was only your average Asian massage parlor experience with not much conversation and only a little enthusiasm. 6/10 overall experience

My experience/comments : I came here for a massage, was presented with MILF lala.

Massage is 6/10

After a massage, lala asked me if I want a HJ for an extra $20. I said yes. then, she asked me if I want her to take off her clothes, she looks busty for a 30 years old, so I said yes for an extra $30. Only touch allowed. no kissing, sucking.

I came in on Saturday at around 2pm, looking for a strong massage, in the past I have been here before massaged by the mamasan. it's a strong massage, which I am looking for. The mamasan, is quite thin and got to be above 30.
But, this time, I was shown Lala. she looks busty altough her face say otherwise.

Okay, paid $35 for 30 mins massage. I get undshe ask for a soft or strong, I said medium. massage was good, hit all the right spot. then she asked for oil massage, I said okay, followed by hot towel massage.
then, she asked me to turn over and gesture for a HJ for an extra $20, I said yes, then, she asked me if she want for her top off, she looks busty, so I said okay for an extra $30.

to my dismay, her boobies is saggy and she doesn't allow sucking, only touching, she play around with my balls and jerk me off. she cleaned me up and left.

Will I come back again ? yes, if I want a strong massage, but not for erotic massage.

overall: nice massage with happy ending. not recommended

Just happened to pass this place today. The place looks nice from outside.and quite discreet. It has a tree fence so people from the main street cannot see us so easily.I don't hv a car and I dont know if there are busses passing this place. So, not so sure if      I will go there. Btw, has anyone got any review on city rose, kingsford?

Sorry boys, resubmitting to meet posting requirements:

Person's Name : Jenny

Establishment : Chinese Massage

Date of Visit : late October 2012

Address : 6/635 Gardeners Rd, Mascot, NSW 2020

Hours of Business : 10am till 7pm

Rates : approx. $35/30 mins, $60/60 mins

Age : 25

Size/shape : C cup, amazing tight but shapely body - would melt in your mouth

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage + topless HJ 

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : This is my favourite massage place in the  Mascot, Alexandria, Rosebery area. The girls have almost always been  clean and enthusiatic. My favourite ever was Vivian. Used to only work  Fridays, not sure if she's still there. Best BJ I ever had!!! She was a sweet little thing with a great GREAT body. 

They very often have new girls trying out. Quality varies but they often will do more than the regular girls.  Ended up in a 69  with one before I even knew it once. All other girls usually have  totally awesome bodies, great massages and usually young. They all vary though as to whether  they'll get naked and allow you to touch pussy and only very few will do  BJs. 

Great place. Best in the area without a doubt. (Reception has asked me a few times if I want a two girl massage - haven't tried that yet.)

On this visit I rocked up on a Wednesday, late October. Reception girl took me into a room, then this hot girl in an awesome summer dress comes in. Her english was very good. She was talkative if I wanted her to be. Massage was actually pretty good, 7.5/10. At the roll over point she asks if I want a HJ. I say ok and tell her to take off her clothes too. We agree $50 but she doesn't want to take off her panties. 

Now she looked awesome in her summer dress, but without it her rack and body were 9/10. I nearly blew my load just watching her undress. I asked for BJ but she wouldn't do it even for extra cash. HJ was very good. She finished me off and then finished the rest of the 1 hour massage too.

Very pleasant girl. Definitely recommend her and the establishment.

Person's Name : Chloe

Establishment : Gardeners Road Chinese massage

Date of Visit : Sunday 20 Jan 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 9669 5581

Hours of Business : 10:00 - 19:00

Rates : 35/30, 40/45,50/60

Age : 23

Size/shape : A little bit curvy, medium tits, firm ass, white skin

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage and nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes if she didn't have her period

My experience/comments : 

Chloe has been reviewed before working at Hurstville and Riverwood. I dropped in last Sunday without a booking and she and another girl were working. The other girl was busy so I got Chloe by chance. Upon first sight I didn't think she was pretty or as good looking as reviewed before. Typical Chinese face however she is mid twenties and speaks English well. Took the 45 min option. Chloe after about ten minutes asked if I wanted extras. I asked if she did nude HJ and the usual reply was "yes" for extra tips - $50. I checked if it meant top and bottom as I have been scammed many times before. Chloe took her clothes off. Body was okay, white skin. Her tits aren't big but match her body well. Her ass is firm not too flat. Anyway Chloe hadn't removed her undies so I asked her to because that was what I had paid for. 

Now this has happened to me before the dreaded period was in place. I told her she should have said so. I lost my hard on because again I felt that she had scammed me and periods put me off too. I don't think these girls should be working during this time. Not fair on the customers if they pay for a nude HJ. Being a nice guy I still continued just playing with her tits and ass. Considering I don't find her overly attractive it was a bit of a waste of money. Time up paid the money and as usual again she said next time I do full nude. I left and went to the city. Other than that I think some customers may like her alot as she has a good attitude and I guess could offer a few more extras. Didn't experience her massage technique.

Person's Name : Not Sure

 Establishment : Gardeners Road Chinese massage

 Date of Visit : Sunday 17 March 2013

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 9669 5581

 Hours of Business : 10:00 - 19:00

 Rates : 35/30, 40/45,50/60

 Age : 30's

 Size/shape : Cute, nice figure. 

 Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

 Services Provided : Massage and HJ

 Value for money/recommend? : No.

 My experience/comments : 

Went in here, mostly actually for the massage. Usually I avoid this place as once you part with the $35 for the half hour, and another $20 for the HJ, and another $20-50 for nude, I might as well have went to 702 and had a ball for $90......but it was mostly massage I was after, so in I went. 

The massage was reasonable, I asked the girl if she did nude, yes for $50, which I declined. Asked about CBJ, yes for $100, I declined.

Get towards the end of my time, flip, and the girl unzips her dress, grabs the old fella and goes to work on it. Weird, as we hadn't talked about this, nor agreed a price. But I figured what the hell. She is quite nice and I would love to fuck her to be honest, but I settle for running my hands over her underwear, whilst she gets me over the line with her hand. 

Get cleaned up and dressed and she tells me I owe her another $50 for the HJ. Whoa. Hang on a minute, so we argue the toss for a couple of minutes and she calls her boss, talks to the boss, hands the phone to me, I tell the boss what happened, we go through this process twice, at which point I have agreed with the boss $20 is the correct fare, which I pay to the now seriously pissed off girl who's face is starting o flush with, honestly don't know if it is anger or embarrassment or what, but I don't think I will be putting my cock anywhere near her again.....

Looks like little Miss Not-Sure is very hungary for the cash, and with you not bowing to her financial requirements, the chancing of fucking her probably went out the window. TBH I would have done the same as you.

Review 1 of 3 – doing three reviews as I wanted to figure out if this place is worth going to anymore now.

Person's Name : Nu-mi

Establishment : Chinese Massage

Date of Visit : 6th March

Address : 6/635 Gardeners Rd, Mascot, NSW 2020

Hours of Business : 10am till 7pm

Rates : approx. $35/30 mins, $60/60 mins

Age : 45+

Size/shape : B cup, very ordinary body – well a 40+ yr old body, wasn’t too good

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean: very basic english

Services Provided : Massage + naked HJ 

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : I hadn’t been here for a while and so was really looking forward to getting back.

Went in and they seemed to have a few punters in already. Went into a room and Nu-mi came in. Wasn’t too impressed, she wasn’t very attractive and was clearly passed her prime. But I asked for a  one hour massage as I really needed one. I also asked for an oil massage like I always do and she started giving me a dry massage. Sometimes they start off like that but after about 10 mins I told her I asked for an oil massage. She said she do soon, she do this first… She actually did a full dry massage before starting all over again and just redoing the full massage with oil this time. It made the whole experience very boring. And the dry massage was very uncomfortable. 

There was zero tackle tickle as well, which pissed me off even more. 

I wasn’t going to ask for any extras as I wasn’t enjoying the experience as well. But I thought I’d take on for the team to complete this review. 

Turnover point and just decided to go for it anyway. Paid the usual $50 for naked HJ, way over-priced given the quality of girl and experience but couldn’t be bothered arguing. She got her gear off to reveal an ok body for a 40+ yr old chick but it was still a 40+ yr old chicks body. Nothing exciting with the HJ.

Finished up and left.

This used to be my favourite massage place in the Alexandra / Mascot area. This experience was so disappointing after not having been there for a while I decided I had to go back to give it another go. Hence the following 2 reviews.

Review 2 of 3.

Person's Name : Mi-mi

Establishment : Chinese Massage

Date of Visit : 10th March

Address : 6/635 Gardeners Rd, Mascot, NSW 2020

Hours of Business : 10am till 7pm

Rates : approx. $35/30 mins, $60/60 mins

Age : 28-32

Size/shape : B cup, great body, tight arse, great looking pussy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese: basic conversational english

Services Provided : Naked massage + HJ and BBBJ 

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : After my last very disappointing experience here I wanted to give them another chance.

Came in and got a new girl, Mi-mi. Very good looking, with a smoking body. Was actually offered two girls but just went with on. Arranged for 1 naked massage from the get go for $50 extra. She was happy to let the hands wander over her body and pussy during the massage. Quite a good massage too, but again, very little to no tackle tickle – not impressed. 

At turn over point, I asked if she did blow-jobs. We arranged for an extra $20 for that. So not a cheap day out but wanted to see what she was like. Very good BBBJ and HJ to finish off. Would definitely see her again. I asked what other days she works and she said she didn’t have any days yet as she was new.

Review 3 of 3 - other 2 reviews just posted here as well.

Person's Name : Can’t remember

Establishment : Chinese Massage

Date of Visit: 7th April

Address : 6/635 Gardeners Rd, Mascot, NSW 2020

Hours of Business : 10am till 7pm

Rates : approx. $35/30 mins, $60/60 mins

Age : 35+

Size/shape : B cup, very ordinary body 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage + naked HJ 

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : After my last experience rekindled my liking for this place I decided to go back again to ensure the quality was there and last time wasn’t a fluke. 

Went in early in the morning. One girl working and no reception. She started making calls, probably to the boss to get a reception chick in. At least the first 20 mins of the 1 hour massage was full of interruptions of her making and receiving calls. It was really starting to piss me off. Couldn’t relax at all. If she’d been a smokin’ hotty, maybe I could give her more leniency but she was very average looking. I’d hve thought if they’d have just one girl working she’d at least be good looking and younger. This chick was neither. There was very minimal tackle tickle.

Again, massage was below average and no tackle tickle at all. Turnover and arrange the standard $50 for naked HJ. Way over-priced for this girl. Body was very average, nothing special at all. She let my hands wander a little bit. Wouldn’t do blow job. 

Left after another very disappointing hour here.

After being a fax of this place for a very long time, fellow punters I have to now recommend you give this place a miss. It’s just not worth it, particularly with 702 Botany Rd just around the corner and getting great reviews – although I don’t go for FS joints. Plus ach time I’ve managed to get back to 382 Botany Rd, that place seems to get better and better as well. There are too many better places around, this place is too inconsistent in terms of quality of girls and quality of experience now. If this changes, I hope someone puts up a review to let us know, until then, go elsewhere.

My experience/comments : Only been into this place once before a couple of yrs ago & got a cold & rude reception from some old bag smoking so I walked .Going past yesterday & decided to have another look . I received a very  warm & friendly reception from a woman very briefly dressed which had my attention immediately .She was no stunner face wise but was dressed to kill!! She was wearing a pink nurses style uniform with a zipper down the front .It was short & just hid her panties but the top is what got me , the zipper was down showing her red bra & a nice small cleavage & when she first stood up & came around the counter ,her legs were high lighted by her high black stilettos . She had me even before she spoke .She was warm & friendly & spoke good English .I took $35 for a test run .Only thing wrong with this place the walls don't go all way up but it is very clean & tidy.
She gave a good firm massage 8/10 . the music was reasonably loud but could still hear a lot of happy noises coming from next room .Had a bit of a chat during the massage &  there was just these slight little tackle brushes that have you wondering ,was that an accident or on purpose ,this woman was experienced & knew what she was doing to keep interest. Flip time & she just started a soft rub on my stomach & then came down close & whispered in my ear ,HJ $20 ,B2b $40 .I went straight for the $40 .She stood in front of me & said ,would you like to unzip me ,done ,then turned around & let me unclip her bra then pull her panties down. All this just added to the mood ,very different .When the bra came off her boobs were only small A's but she had a firm body ,no fat ,she would be early 40 .She slid on top rubbing her nipples all over & was going right down & at one stage I thought she started licking my shaft & nuts ,so I had to have a quick look but she was blowing ,not licking but it was a great sensuous feeling . then she moved off & started a great slow rub & there was no restriction to wandering hands .I was rubbing her clit til she brought me to a great climax . She gave a quick tissue clean up & got dressed & told me she was going for a hot towel then came back & gave a good rub down .She said no one was waiting so gave me a face massage ,10 minutes over time but no worries .All finished ,I got dressed & saw her outside . I gave her $50 for the xtra & she went for change but I said no ,that's for the xtra time .She came & gave me a cuddle & kiss .For a walk in & first time this was my best punt for a long time ,I will definitely return ,I think there could be more to be had from this friendly woman .
Cheers

My experience/comments : Out the East today & on way home my car automatically turned into Bunnings carpark Mascot .So I had to go for a wander over the Rd to this joint. When I walked in & saw what was standing at the reception I thought ,Oh no,a fairly chubby girl in shorts & tee who did not appeal to me at all ,she looked up from her phone then jabbered some thing & out of room 4 came this "China Doll" .She was beautiful ,you want massage ? & ushered me into room 4 ,which is at the rear & fairly dark with a small table lamp on .I gave her $60 for the hr & stripped & lay down .All the usual when she came back in ,soft or hard ?? I asked for hard & what followed was a top massage .It was firm but was more of a Swedish massage ,very unusual in a Chinese shop . She gave a fabulous firm massage with long flowing strokes & although it was firm, after a few minutes it also started becoming very sensual as well .After all the shoulders & back were finished she started a great massage on my arse which went for about 10 minutes & really had me turned on .There was no tackle play but she was going down the outside of my legs ,then back up the inside & back around my arse .All so close but never touching .Turn over please & she started massaging my stomach ,something I really enjoy & I started rubbing her bum .First on the outside of her dress ,then under on her pants .The one thing wrong with this place are the low walls so not much conversation but the old HJ signal ,yes .Then she pointed to her dress & indicated $50 ,another yes .I just wanted to see her body .She took off her dress & bra but left her pants on , Oh well!! A beautiful body to go with the face ,gorgeous boobs all natural about a B with lovely soft pink nipples ,well soft for the moment .She started softly running her nails up the inside of my legs ,then around the sack & along my shaft .I was rubbing her bum then her boobs & pulled her closer & started sucking on those nipples .I put a finger in the side of her pants to pull them down but she took my hand away ,then to my surprise took her pants off to reveal a black but nicely trimmed bush .She let me play on the outside only ,no fingers inside but she got very wet very quick with the mutual rubbing happening .I could not hold for too long & shot straight up my chest & copped a shot on my chin .She kept rubbing until fully drained .
A very beautiful woman with top service .
I went back again yesterday & saw Amy again .Great service again but alas wrong time of the month ,no pussy play today,  .BUT I shall return to see Amy

Services Provided : nude massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

After reading gboat1’s reviews and as I was going to the airport, thought it appropriate to check this place out.   No parking out front, plenty in Bunnings carpark opposite.     Clean rooms, fresh tissue on the massage table.

Angela, quite pretty, nice short skirt and happy personality.   Paid for 45 minutes and stripped.     Very competent massage and allowed touch of the legs.    Medium massage with oil and hot towel cleanup.

Turned over, she offered HJ $20 and nude B2B $50, negotiated down to $40.  Nice body, nice natural A cups with nipples that stood out about 15 mm like cigarette butts.    She enjoyed me giving them appropriate oral attention.    Trimmed lower deck and allowed clit tickle but no inside   .     As the HJ proceeded she got quite wet, which assisted me go over the line.      Good value.

Works Tuesdays and Fridays.

Hi Bent Leg, just confirming you saw Angela and not Amy? Reason I ask is the intro says Amy but the body of the review says Angela (copy and paste error maybe?). I'm assuming Angela because I've seen Amy and her boobs are B cups and coming from the north her nipples aren't like cigarette butts.

Value for money/recommend? : Another vanilla experience...

My experience/comments : Day off, surf is crap so time for another massage, 2nd one this week....Walk into shop, greeted by Yuki early 20's Chinese girl. When she first said her name, I asked if she was Japanese but she just shrugged her shoulders and said No!...Here we go! Opted for the half hr.

The massage wasn't that bad, it was ok and I felt better for it, but she lacked interest and yawned a few times.
I was going to leave it at that but turned over and agreed for a $20 HJ. She offered to take clothes off but I declined..
I must admit that the old fella wasn't really into it but the HJ was ok & she got him over the line, cleaned up and out the door.

I don't think I will go back and see this girl as she just wasn't into it...poor thing, bet she hates doing this stuff...

 Hours of Business : 10/7

 Rates : $35 /30 $60/60 $50/45

 Age : mid to late 20s

 Size/shape : Size 8 b cups

 Nationality or Ethnicity :Chinese

 Services Provided : massage /B2B HJ +70

 Value for money/recommend? : Yes

Picking up a mate at the airport with time to kill so survey AUXXX and picked this place - handy location and reasonably discreet.

Entered and was given Vivian plain looing really but pleasant enough not much conversation but English was so so.

Place is clean enough but only 3/4 height walls and music was close to loud but killed the background noise. Except for the incessant beep of an iPhone incoming message which was constant.

Vivian was presentable in a short black dress and asked for pressure required which I asked for medium and it was close to that.

There were several noticeable disclaimers about asking for and receiving and sexual services and that the girls do not perform any services with the knowledge of management (or words to that effect).

Massage proceeded and was reasonable say a 6/10 and as she moved down the legs there were approaches made toward the groin. That was causing a chemical reaction which has the subsequent response of the hips raising to provide comfort. To that there was a response of some tackle tickle of the highest order and it was having a marked effect.

The eventual turnover and negotiation proceeded and the nude B2B was agreed. The body to body was more like breast to nether region bit still the effect was pleasing. The HJ then proceeded and must say that it was quite enjoyable too.

While her legs remained tight, some light play was not discouraged and all this led to an eventual crescendo. This followed some more massage, clean up and good bye.

Overall would recommend a second visit but would probably prefer to sample others. Beats waiting a Arrivals or even the Maccas carpark.

This is a shop out in nowhere land, but I did visit it two or three times in the past few years:

The opportunities:

1. If I am doing shopping across the road at Bunnings. Well, that's an hour and a half away from work - and let's make it two hours when I squeeze in a 30 min quickie !!

2. To or from the airport - again, if more time permits, I would venture out a bit further and visited Newtown, if time was tight, then a 30 min real quickie was the go.

Other than that, I can't see why on earth would I get there for a punt - and believe me, it was a punt in the dark every time !! which is not my usual way to go, I don't like surprises nor disappointment, that's why it's always best to see your regular MLs or at least visit the shops you know - and if all fails, perhaps the mamasans will make it up - and won't that be NICE !

Thanks mate,


Don't get me wrong, not trying to put anyone down. We have all been in the game long enough to know that there are always plenty of hidden gems scattered all over Sydney and that's why forum like AUXXXReview are valuable in sourcing out all the goodies.

In short, if the punt is pre-planned - I usually would book ahead, it's only the last minute opportunistic type of walking into the great unknown...............lol

My only advantage is, being Chinese, I have never been disappointed for Not getting a happy ending - whether I was indeed very happy or just merely a physical relief, well, that's punting !!

Local knows best, location, location, location !!

Enough said.

Cheers

Lungor  you say you don't like surprises or disappointments ,& only like your regulars BUT how does one become a regular without initially meeting her . Someones favourite in their eyes could be a complete DUD with someone else . We will only find new girls we like by experimenting till we find someone compatible .That's why it's called PUNTING .

Brother gboat1, 


Very wise words, and very true pretty much for most punters starting out., and that's why forum like this is so invaluable that can really help people.

But then again, once you have punted for a little while, you can build up a hand full of regular shops and regular ladies pretty quickly. Once again, I am purely talking about RnT. Things will be a lot less complicated with FS shops!

I am one of those punters who can only visit shops in the CBD without too much efforts, shops outside of the CBD will be a challenge ! However, a lot of brothers would have a lot more freedom especially all those still single brothers who can pretty much go any where and find more challenges and adventures - and I, unfortunately don't have the time nor opportunities !!

Each to his own, so while you can, ENJOY !!

Cheers

Person's Name : Melissa (I think)

Establishment : Chinese Remedial Massage

Date of Visit : 3/5/2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : same as previous posts

Hours of Business : 10am Gil ????

Rates : $50.00 45 min and $60.00. 60 min

Age : mid 30's

Size/shape : slim with a cups but fantastic legs and bum

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage B2B and HJ $50.00

Value for money/recommend? : yes 

My experience: on a previous thread for this place I was quite disparaging about my experience. That was over a year ago and I thought I would give it a try. Glad I did.

Started with a young gi but she had to go. As I am an older gent I think they just swapped with the older girl. I'm glad they did. Her massage was excellent and included continual arse stroking and tackle tickle. I was ready for the final onslaught a long time before the massage was done. 

Melissa as had the nicest pins I have seen on a ML for a long time. Long legs and a firm and slender arse. She also knew what she was doing and offered to get another girl for the ending. I told her no. I will just have you. Best thing I did. I think she appreciated that I did not want another girl and the service I got was great. During the B2B she kept playing with me and the stop. She would place her breasts in my mouth and kept raising her leg to allow me access to her pussy. Only drawback was really meaty pussy lips. Once through them she was wet and accommodating. As I kept going she decided to start the HJ. Technique was great and once I exploded she kept going until I went flax. Marvellous.

My last  post on 635 was not great. But nor was the service. This visit was the exact opposite. I had a great time. And to previous posts on this thread. I did not book. I walked in and took a punt. Sometimes the best thing you can do. The next best is to write a review about your experience.

Establishment : Chinese Remedial Massage

Date of Visit : 3/7/2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : same as previous posts

Hours of Business : 10am - ???

Rates : $40 30 min + tips

Age : 30's I would say but looks younger

Size/shape : Slim with B cups, nice figure

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage + nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes 

I was across the road at Bunnings getting some stuff and thought of this place. Last time I was here was a couple of years ago when I saw the beautiful Amy (who I believe still works here but I have no idea which day). But that's another story. I walk in without a booking and the girl behind the counter looks pleasant enough so I decide to stay, half an hour option taken and Lisa shows me to the front room.

For those that don't know this place it is quite well fit out inside. Decent size rooms which look clean. Only down side is the walls don't go up to the ceiling so sound can carry to the next rooms and to the reception area. Lisa is reasonably pretty and wearing a cute knee length dress and I can tell she is slim. Her english seems quite good and she has an air about her which implies some experience at this line of work. I get the standard medium strength massage (had better, had worse) and after around 20 minutes Lisa starts brushing my inner thighs and the tackle tickle begins. 

On turn over happy ending is offered and nude as an option. I take her up on that as she looks cute. I wasn't disappointed, her body is slim and curvy- nicely proportioned. All natural B cups. Technique is good, Lisa gives plenty of encouragement and leans across me and whispers into my ear (I think this was because of the lack of sound proofing in the room but nevertheless very pleasant). I can't hold out very long as she is looking good and I blow.

All in all a pleasant experience from a street smart girl who is willing to please. I will return for another visit if I get the chance. Lisa works Sundays.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6/635 Gardeners Rd Mascot

Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm

Rates : $40 30 min + tips

Age : Around 30 but looks younger

Size/shape : Size 6, A cups, tiny girl

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : massage + nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes 

Was in the area and stopped by for a bit of relaxation (most of my punts here have at least been ok sometimes better). The boss was actually there this time, first time had seen her. It was Lydia's turn and although I am not especially keen on Thai girls she sure looked ok, very small and a nice smile. In the room she was very cute and attentive, asking if the massage was ok etc. She obviously has some experience doing this kind of work and her english is very good.

I just went for the half hour so the time passed quickly to turn over time. The usual question was asked and accepted, Lydia stripped to reveal a very slim frame and pointy A cups. Very nice if you like tiny girls. Part 2 was very good, Lydia sure knows what she is doing and is not shy. Like I said she has some experience I think. Not sure whether more was on offer, in this place the sound carries a bit and I didn't ask.

I left with a smile on my face, very pleasant experience. Lydia works Saturdays here. As usual YMMV.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6/635 Gardeners Rd Mascot   9669 5581

Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm

Rates : $40 30 min 

Age : She said 30 but I’d say 40

Size/shape :   Size 8, A cup, trimmed bush

Nationality or Ethnicity :   Chinese, excellent English, very friendly.

Services Provided : massage + nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes 

This would be the same Jessie reviewed here by gboat1 three years ago.      Her experience shows.

Greeted by Jessie with short figure hugging outfit and push up bra displaying nice cleavage.      Signed up for 30 minutes and negotiated nude for $50.       Would not take $40.

She stripped and revealed A cups with cigarette butt nipples, fairly bushy, trimmed at the edges.  She started by grinding her backside against my cock which I found quite stimulating.     Lay her down and commenced Blatchford style massage.    She has quite prominent inner lips sticking out from pussy.

She liked breast attention, especially the nipples and allowed clit tickle, she called for some oil so I thought she is not getting with it.    She then said she would take over and cum which she did while I played with titties and stroked the old boy to maintain his interest.     She did not show any interest in FS, although it might be on if one builds a relationship.

Then it was my turn, very capable HJ and allowed me to insert a finger, very damp, and got me over the line.     An 8/10 massage then followed until time.   Clean up with hot towel.

Jessie is an old hand at this game and good value.   She works here Thursdays and Saturdays.      

She also works Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 2/238 Prospect Road Seven Hills.    No posts for this place in main forum but there is one in Bronze.

Person's Name : Bella

Date of Visit : January 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6/635 Gardeners Road, Mascot | Mascot relaxation massage, mascot massage

Hours of Business : 9.30am - 8.00pm

Rates : $65/hr + $50 tip

Age : mid-20s

Size/shape : size 8, 5'7", D cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC?

Services Provided : RnT+

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : I selected this AMP based on convenience and the positive recent reviews above (thanks chaps). The shop is one of several ground floor businesses under a residential/commercial building. I found parking behind the block on Church Avenue, though later noticed a small visitors car park adjacent the building just off Gardeners Road (if you're lucky enough to find a spot).

My first impression upon entering was that it seemed like a clean and tidy legit-looking shop. It was quiet and a MILF type behind the reception desk greeted me. She sized me up quickly and said she had a very nice girl, as she ushered me into the room nearest her desk. The room was also neat and tidy, with the only drawback being that the walls did not extend to the ceiling. I was soon joined by a very attractive young woman in shorts and loose T-shirt. She had lovely long hair, full lips that were quick to smile, and a slim but curvy figure. Her name was Bella and I decided it was an apt pseudonym for her. She could easily be described as beautiful. 

Bella took the hourly rate from me and asked me to undress. I expected her to do the usual ducking out for fresh towels or whatever, but no, she stood there and watched me strip. Any notion this might have been a legit parlour dissipated at that point. Thank goodness. 

I lay on the table and Bella began a pleasant relaxing massage. She checked it was to my satisfaction after a few minutes and I assured her it was very good -- not really remedial, more relaxation style which is my preference. She did my back, arms and legs, her luxuriant dark mane occasionally caressing my skin whenever she leant over -- heaven for a hair fetishist like me. Bella eventually transitioned to a more sensual touch and lingered over my bum and between my thighs, and I ensured there was absolutely no misunderstanding by widening the angle as much as possible. Soon she introduced herself to Little Richard and the Stones with her oily hands and I raised my bum to facilitate access all areas. She clearly knew what she was doing and it felt fantastic, so I got on my hands and knees and let her continue slowly stroking and milking me for a few minutes. Naturally I was rock hard by now so her whispered query to confirm I would like a happy ending, with her offer to be naked, seemed entirely superfluous. (I replied in the affirmative.) 

Bella undressed and displayed her gorgeous body to me with that mischievous smile all hot girls use to let you know they know how hot they are. I was on my back by now and began caressing her silky skin and hair as she kept working on my cock and balls. I had to shift my position a couple of times and guide her hands away once or twice to keep myself from exploding too soon. In terms of touching her, I took my cues from her body language and quickly worked out her boundaries. Bella was cool with me kissing her cheeks, neck and breasts though didn't seem keen on a proper pash, and she kept her legs together so her bush seemed off limits too. She had a peachy round bottom and didn't mind me giving it a good rub and squeeze. She particularly appeared to enjoy me licking her pretty pink nipples, moaning and whispering 'yes' and 'good' at periodic intervals. At one point she asked if I would like her to suck me, but that was extra and I decided to maintain fiscal restraint. 

When time was drawing near, I sat on the side of the massage table and got her to stand facing me between my legs, my feet braced against the wall. As she brought me to the brink with her soft expert hands, she looked into my eyes with a sexy pouty smile and opened the throttle. That was all I could take and a week's worth of cum erupted over my belly and down her fingers. Bella kept jerking me off like a pro and didn't stop until I was completely drained. 

The clean-up was brisk and professional without being an indecent rush, I tipped her the agreed amount, and she reminded me of her name for next time, offering her cheek for a farewell kiss. All in all, a great RnT session with a very sexy lass. The only minor complaint was that the MILF receptionist spent much of the time talking loudly on the phone during my massage, which was amplified by the gap between the wall and ceiling, but fortunately it quietened down when she left the shop for a while before the second part. Otherwise, it didn't sound like there was anybody else around but I expect it would be quite easy to hear anything more than soft moaning and groaning coming from the rooms.

Name: Nikki

Contact Details/Address: Unit 8 635 Gardeners Rd, Alexandria 

Date of visit 22/05/18

Prices:  $40 1/2 hr  $50 3/4 hr $60 1hr IN CASH + extras

Age: late 20's

Size/shape: Chunky with small breasts

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: massage and a hj for $20, $50 B2B

Value for money/recommend so-so

My experience: I had an hour to kill and in the area so a quick "massage near me" search on Google spat out this joint. 

I called the number and mamasan urged "we look after you".  I made my way there in no time. 

The entrance is off a busy road and adjacent to residential and retail premises. There are a few people about so not so discreet. 

The shop has a small reception area with small rooms lined to the right. The walls don't go all the way to the ceiling meaning that you get to hear everything that goes on inside the RNT. I didn't enjoy that too much but I was on a mission. 

Nikki showed me to my room and asked me to disrobe. Minutes later she provided an average massage without many trimmings (ie TT). 

Upon turnover at 30min, Nikki offered HJ for $20 or B2B for $50. 

I had used all my cash for the massage upfront but Nikki suggested EFT so I thought, why not?

While Nikki was rather plain she looked a little more attractive when peeled. She's a rounder girl with generous hips and plump bum. She has small a-cup boobs but big marshmallow nipples. Unfortunately she had garlic breath and this was off putting. 

Anyway, I was there for a purpose and soldiered on. 

Nikki let me play with her cat after disinfecting my fingers. She had huge flaps but I didn't mind. She was wet in a jiffy. 

While Nikki got herself in a lather it meant she was yanking my old fella of its perch. So I asked for more oil and a gentler approach. She got me over the line eventually. 

Nikki cleaned me with wet wipes and towel. 

Finally she came in with a piece of paper with 7-8 bank details for MLs working there. I EFTd the pineapple and she took a pic of receipt.  

Nikki works Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

Would I be back? Only if I'm in the area with an hour to kill. 


Happy punting!

My experience/comments : After a great first visit, I gave this shop another whirl and was similarly pleased with the outcome. On this occasion, a cute and petite China doll greeted me as I entered and ushered me into a room. The mamasan was not at the desk and it sounded like a couple of the other rooms were occupied.

Snow, the ML who was luckily available for me, had long dark hair and was dressed in a pink dress. She had a confident air about her and ducked out to get some change while I changed into nothing for total comfort. Her massage was gentle but firm and included a few brushes in between my legs, which promptly parted further to signal my lack of any inhibitions. Snow was quick to take the hint and returned there as she moved from my back down to my legs and up again.

By now it was apparent I was 'up' for the extra in more ways than one, but she duly confirmed this with me and quoted the standard amount, to which I agreed. She unzipped her dress and joined me on the table, treating me to a bodyslide. Like many petite girls, she had small breasts but they were tipped with nice long nipples. And like most such nips, they were very sensitive and she seemed to enjoy me rolling my tongue around and over them lightly, before progressing to some more determined flicking. Snow stifled her moans and pulled away, panting slightly and fixing me with a grateful and sly smile. She took matters into hand and played with my bits and bobs while she returned the favour by licking my erect nipples, her hair tickling my tummy. My hands roved over her smooth svelte figure but she kept her legs closed and I didn't probe too far.

When it all got too hard, I whispered to her and she stroked me to completion, not stopping until I was spent and the contents were spilled across my belly. Snow gave me a quick peck and efficiently cleaned me up, and I thanked her with a pineapple. As I left, the mamasan checked that all had been to my satisfaction and I assured her with a grin that indeed it had.

Person's Name : Jennifer

Establishment : Mascot Massage

Date of Visit : March 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6/635 Gardeners Road, Mascot | Mascot relaxation massage, mascot massage

Hours of Business : 9.30am - 8.00pm

Rates : $65/hr + $50 tip

Age : 30-ish

Size/shape : size 8, 5'5", B cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : RnT+

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Finding myself in Mascot again at the end of March, I gravitated back towards this tidy little shop. It seemed busier than the previous two times as nobody was immediately on hand to greet me, but soon a smiling Thai girl emerged from one of the rooms and quickly showed me into a free one nearest the entrance. She took the $65 and disappeared to finish off her previous client.

I undressed and made myself comfortable and it was a few minutes before Jennifer, as she introduced herself, returned in a slight rush. She was still smiling and had a cute girl-next-door look about her. Her English was quite good and sounded like she might be a local rather than a visiting student. Jennifer proceeded to give me a massage, which was OK but unfortunately involved use of her forearms on my back. Luckily that didn't last too long and she did my sides and legs with long flowing strokes. There was some TT but she didn't progress to full reach-through.

After I turned over, she confirmed I was happy to take up the optional extra and slipped out of the frock she was wearing. I noticed she kept her panties on. Her breasts were pert and nipples appeared quite excited.  However, Jennifer seemed a bit shy and avoided eye contact while she stroked me and as I caressed her slim figure. She didn't object to my licking her nips though and liked having her cheeks squeezed. As we played some more, she seemed to loosen up a bit and the smile returned along with the occasional glance up at me. When I felt the time was right, I urged her to make me cum and she readily obliged. A quick clean-up and then a head massage to round off the session. I tipped Jennifer the usual amount and left happy.

Person's Name : Yoko (sp?)

Establishment : Mascot Massage

Date of Visit : December 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6/635 Gardeners Road, Mascot | Mascot relaxation massage, mascot massage

Phone : (02) 9669 5581

Rates : $65/hr + $50 tip

Age : mid-20s

Size/shape : size 8, 5'4", petite

Value for money/recommend? : So-so

My experience/comments : This shop has become a regular haunt of mine over the past year, thanks to its steady supply of mostly uni age MLs who are not shy about taking off their kit and having a roll in the hay (or on the table), so I was looking forward to a final hurrah for 2018.

When I arrived, there was no sign of life but the entry bell soon summoned a petite young woman from the back. I was somewhat disappointed that her hair was dyed that reddish brown colour that seems to have become increasingly popular with Asian girls since the '90s -- much prefer the natural jet black look. She barely managed a smile but politely ushered me to a vacant room and took my cash for the hour. I could hear a not-so-muffled word or two from the adjacent room, as voices carry quite clearly over the walls due to the large gap below the ceiling. These voices, male and female, were speaking in Mandarin (presumably) so my comprehension was non-existent other than to deduce the chap was enjoying his massage.

As usual, I undressed in a flash and was ready on the table with the well-practised muscle memory of a seasoned punter. The same girl returned shortly afterwards and unfolded a towel over me. Then began the longest pressure massage phase I have ever endured. Normally, I don't mind it as a 5-minute or so prelude to the main oil massage, but this seemed to go on and on. She worked her way up one side and down the other, over and over, while I kept assuming surely this is going to wind up any moment now... now... now... Until I realised this may continue for most of my booking if I didn't intervene pronto, so I suggested she could probably start with the oil now. "Oh, OK," she said like it would never have occurred to her to do so otherwise.

Her oil massage was only a slight improvement as she used her forearms in that lazy way I find pretty annoying these days. (Maybe I'm a jaded punter.) While she went over my bum a few times, there was no real TT other than a genuinely accidental brush or two of my ballsac. I had already decided this was going to be the wooden spooner of my multiple sessions here, so wasn't expecting much when she asked me to turn over and enquired about the extras.

I confirmed the rates -- $30 for HJ, $50 for NHJ -- and opted for the latter option as usual. As we became more intimately familiar with each other, she said her name was Yoko (possibly Youko?) and eagerly stroked my cock. A bit too eagerly; I had to slow her down a few times. Like all MLs here, she was OK with me fondling and kissing her boobs, but had also removed her panties so I could tease her between the legs (some others keep them on). I kissed my way down to her trim bush before I sensed she was getting ready to put up a roadblock, so returned to licking her erect nipples. They seemed quite sensitive and Yoko was moaning and muttering plenty of "yes"s, but also speeding up her hand action on my joystick. We went through a few positions, making sure I had enough access to her tits and/or arse, and I was enjoying myself enough to forgive her mediocre massage. She returned the favour by licking by nips and it was all over in a satisfying explosion with a few minutes to spare for dressing up.

Not my favourite booking at this shop, and Yoko is possibly a bit new, but she just needs some tutelage in improving her massage technique to meet the grade, as her second part was as good as any.

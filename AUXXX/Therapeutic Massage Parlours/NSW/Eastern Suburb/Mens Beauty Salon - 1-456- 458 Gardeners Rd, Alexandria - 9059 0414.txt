My experience/comments :.

So I've been searching for a new place to get laser Brazilian after the last lady I used sold her business.  For some reason Gumtree threw up the ad linked above last week out of the blue.  I called up to check the pricing and spoke to Jenny (she has pretty basic english and I think we struggled to understand each other), she confirmed it was $69 for a brazilian laser and they have $10 off promotion at the moment.  This was the same price as I paid previously so thought I'd give it a go.  I enquired if I needed to shave before the treatment or if they would do that, she said either but they could do it for and extra $20.  I'd never had anyone shave my cock and balls before - winner!!!!  I said I'd come at the weekend but never made it.

So today I figured I'd see if they were free, I called a few times from 10am but no one picked up until after 10:30.  I spoke with a girl who had great english, she advised Jenny wasn't in and would get her to call me.  Jenny called back later in the day and I made an appointment with her.

In between my initial call a week ago and my visit, I did a bit of looking around online and only found the crackerbee ad, which summed up I may get extras..

I drive over, they have parking in the building which is very handy due to the location.  I enter and Jenny and the girl I spoke to earlier are there.  Jenny is mid 40's I guess, 5 foot maybe 5" 1', she is wearing a tight top, big tits I'm guessing enhanced by the size compared to her frame and a short skirt.  The other girl (I wish I'd got her name)  was about 5"5' very slim size 4-6 but not skinny, must have A cups by the look of the padding in her bra, later 30's and quite cute.

They show me into a small room and wheel in the laser machine.  To my surprise, Jenny blurts out "well get it out, lets have a look", I just looked at her and she said "take down" so I proceeded to undo my shorts and drop them and my underwear to my ankles, she took hold of my cock moved it around, had a look and muttered something in chinese to the other girl who was also in the small room with us.  She then said "you not shave?" to which I told her she said in the phone she could do it, again lost in translation I think.  She asked me to remove my things and lie on the bed.

So I figured there could be more, and took everything off rather than just the bottom half.  I'm lying on the bed waiting in anticipation for Jenny enter then to rub in the shaving gel and shave off my brazilian hair.  I think the shaving was either lost in translation or the chinese shave their balls differently.  She came in with hair clippers, I politely told her they were not going anywhere near my cock or balls, she then pulled out and electric philips lady shaver, I'm sure its great on the taught skin on ladies legs but on a floppy cock and the loose skin of your balls it's not good.  She called the other girl in and one tried to stretch my skin while the other hacked away at the hair with the lady shaver, after 20 mins the managed to get it all off except my balls and I told them I think it will be OK.  Not only was it terrible for the job but also not very hygienic.

They fired up the laser machine and gave me my protective glasses.  Jenny covered me in cooling gel and started zapping away, the other girl held my had and placed another hand seductively on my leg and translated everything Jenny was telling me about the treatment into English.  Jenny was very thorough with her zapping, more than I've had before - not sure if this is a good or bad thing, I'm guessing good as I've found at previous places they have missed bits.

So it comes to the end of the treatment, Jenny asked if I'd like a massage saying the other girl is a great masseuse.  I tell Jenny I'm tempted but don't have time, but I could do with a happy ending - she just laughed at me and carried on cleaning things away.  I'm about to get up and get dressed and she said, I'll go get the other girl to give you a HJ, LOL I didn't think it was going to happen.  She left and comes back 2 mins latter saying the other girl is busy so she will do it, $20 tip OK?  I agree and she gives me a very good slow HJ with ball massaging and teasing the tip, I cum all over her hand she cleans me and gets a hot towel.  I slipped my hand up her short skirt and she had a nice firm ass, but she told me no touching and moved slightly away.

After I paid for my session she asks if I'd like to book a course of laser treatment, she then tells me they have a special on for $29 a session if I book 6 sessions.  I think this must be the cheapest place in Australia for laser...  So I booked up for 6 sessions and now will just need to pay $20 each time for a HJ..  Lesson learned, I will be shaving my own cock and balls next time before I go....

I'm not sure what the massage is like, I may give it a try if I go at a weekend when I have more time.

Great review. Lucky they weren't using a cut throat.

Any further post laser issues?

I'm a wax afficiando and never having done laser wondering around the efficacy and long term gains over wax.

Certainly at $29 a session it's significantly cheaper than a wax 

May have to pay a visit and book

All good this morning, no after effects.

I've had 12 laser sessions before around 12-18 months ago.  I noticed within a few sessions how slow the hair was growing back and where it did it was really thin and soft, after 6 sessions whole areas I had no hair growth at all.

Laser is permanent and kills the hair at the follicles, unlike waxing that just rips it out.

My last laser lady recommended a treatment every 4 weeks and shaving a few times a week in between and depending on hair type 6-12 sessions should be enough.. 

Laser works best on dark hair and skin, if you have grey hair I'm pretty sure it doesn't work.

The SeaRay visited this new and very interesting establishment for $15 Haircut from these very foxy Asian MILF's and whilst having a cut we (the 3 of us) discussed the Men's Pubic Laser treatment at $25. After dropping my pants to show them my Penis, they both had a fiddle and after lying on the Table, the older one put a liquid all over my doodle and balls whilst the other one watched, After the Laser treatment in which I expected to remove the hair stubble (I was actually shaven but let the hair grow back after reading this thread last week for them to check out) noticing the pubic hair on my shaft were not removed by the laser, I then went for the $20 Penis / Pubic SHAVE and fuck it was fun with her Tackle Tickle 
Several hours later, I returned for a MASSAGE @ $40 for a 1/2 hour from the older one and the usual massage shop options which we may just leave it there.

I visited again in early December (I'll write my review this week).  The place has changed names to Laser Moment Medispa and they have changed the front signage.  The new Gumtree add is:

https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/alex...men/1233487082

Last time I went they were having phone line issues but I would have expected that to have been sorted.  They also have a mobile that I found on another Ad months ago that I was able to contact them on in December 0423 229 339.

They also advised me that they were returning to China for a month for Chinese NY, I think they were away 10/01 > 09/02 - if not these dates it was very similar as I remember I wouldn't be able to fit in my Jan treatment.

Dropped in here to check things out in early January.  Got a haircut from the older lady which was ok but as mentioned earlier, hygiene may be an issue as it doesn't appear they sterilise scissors, combs.  I did ask about waxing but they re-dip the spatula.  

They also have a groupon so they don't mind the getting female clientele.  https://www.groupon.com.au/deals/laser-clinic-spa-2

My experience/comments :.

This place has now reopened following their shutdown for Chinese NY.

Headed over for my Brazilian laser that I have purchased a package for.  Rita was on her own today.  The place is clean and tidy and has parking available for clients.

Shown into the laser room and stripped naked and lay on the bed.  Rita entered and had a check of my cock and balls to make sure I'd shaved, we had a discussion around regrowth and areas that were responding well.  She applied the cooling cream and spread it around with a spatula.

Rita is a hot girl with a smoking body, she was wearing a long tight black skirt with a skin tight white t-shirt that stopped about an inch before her skirt started exposing her midriff.  As soon as she took hold of my cock to begin the laser session I hardened up in her hand, a very nice feeling.  The laser here is very very thorough, way more involved than anywhere else I've had laser.

So after I'd been hard in Rita's hand for 30 mins I asked if she had time to give me a 30 min massage.  I had a naked run through the Spa as I moved from laser room to massage room, hopped on the bed and Rita followed.  The massage wasn't bad, more relaxing than therapeutic.  20 mins in and it was time for the flip, on turnover I asked for a HJ.  Rita immediately oiled up my cock and balls and started the erotic part, she has a great technique and had me on edge for a while.  I started touching her ass and it was amazing I told her so and she thanked me, I then slid my hand up he long skirt to her ass and she was happy for me touch her ass and rub her pussy through her gstring. With her ass in my hand and her doing a double hand pump on my cock I was soon being milked and white goo was running over her fingers as she continued to milk me.

A fantastic session, I'm not sure if she would be up for more as it is a "legit" Spa now.

So when you shave below are you suppose to leave a bit of stubble for them to laser? This sounds interesting.

You don't leave any stubble, clean shaven and the laser light penetrates to kill the hair follicles..

I had another successful session with Rita last weekend.  She's obviously getting to know me now as at then end of the laser session she asked if I wanted hand relief and a massage before I left

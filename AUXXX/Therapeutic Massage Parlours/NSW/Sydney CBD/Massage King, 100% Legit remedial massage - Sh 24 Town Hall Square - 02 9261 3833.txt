My experiences:


I have known Kitty for many years, she used to work at the Hygienic Massage at Sydney Central, 1/F near the Zilver Restaurant, since that shop was closed down 5-6 years ago, I have lost contact with Kitty and another big grade Taiwanese massage lady called Eva.

Quite by accident, I ran into Kitty last week at the Townhall station, and she told me she is now working at the Massage King Shop, follow her to the shop and got a card for the phone number. So this week I can't wait to catch up with Kitty.

Now, I must stress again, then Kitty is a genuinely fully qualified massage master, and Massage King is a 100% legit shop, so no monkey business OK, I post this because Kitty is the Best of the Best massage lady I have ever met, so this is purely an information sharing, you need a good strong massage fix, you can see Kitty and she will fix you for sure.

Only have time for 45 min so paid the $50 when I got there, the shop is quite spacious, typical massage king shopping centre set up, comfy big seats in the outside for foot massage, and all the cubicals are separated by pulling curtains only, timber floor, the shop is very clean and nicely decorated with relaxing ambience. Kitty shows me to the space immediately behind the reception, stripped down to my undies and ready for a special treat !!

Kitty put her hand on my neck and have a feel then on my shoulder and she moved straight to using her elbow on my butt, and of course, those were where most of my sore spots are, it is amazing she didn't have to ask, she just has a few touches and a feel and she knows exact where my problem areas are. so for the next 20-25 min Kitty was primarily using her fist and elbow and forearms and pressing down on all the pressure points on both sides of my butt, along my spines, my waist and the points on both sides of my jaws and they were really sore when she touches them, none of my MLs in the past 5 years have even touched those areas, I was totally in Kitty mercy and knowing that I would be feeling much better afterwards, I just let her continue on her routines, occasionally I have to let out a scream when it was really hurting, but most of the times I was standing it.

Then Kitty suggested that she want to do some back walking for me, now, this shop is Not installed with those hand rails above the massage table for back walking, but this room is quite narrow, so when Kitty stands on top on me, and she extend her arms, she can rest her hand on one side wall of the room or using the ceiling as a support. Again, Kitty must be the back walking Queen that I have ever had, she is better than Candy, Coco and Eva, and I think half way through the back walks I had fallen asleep, when Kitty finished, she woke me up and said my session has finished, the feeling, have not felt this good for a very long time, sure, a happy ending right there and then would be great, but I would be happy just to see Kitty for she strong massage and nothing else.

The good thing is, this shop is so close to 1B QVB, so if I need a part 2, I can have it in 5 min, so no problem there at all.

And I have not had a good foot massage for a long time also, so I think I will have to arrange a time where I can have a foot massage, followed by a session from Kitty. then I will walk over to QVB for a little relaxation..........................haha, that would be some treatment to myself.

Once again, Kitty, highly recommended !!

Cheers

Welcome the forum Brother Growl,

Excellent report for a massage session. I couldn't have written any better myself. 

First and foremost, to answer your question, if you want a 100% legit massage with no chance of getting less than 60 min of full body relaxation (NO RnT!!) then you must try the Hygienic Massage at Sydney Central - opposite from the Capitol Theatre, 1st Floor near the Zilver Chinese Restaurant, Kitty (from Hong Kong, M, T, W only and you must book - 9211-8666, other ML are also good as their general standard is very high, eg. Monica from 288 was first trained there!) is the best Chinese masseure in Sydney at the moment - just my humble opinion.
			
		






			
				Dear Brother Splash,

There is a place called Hygienic Massage (9211-8666) on level 1 of the Sydney Central Building (same floor as the Zilver Chinese Restaurant). The building is opposite the Capitol Theatre at the corner of Pitt Street and the Metro Light Rail. 

The cost is $60.00/hr totally legit, no HJ or extras or anything, please respect the staff there and don't even ask. Most of the girls will give you a strong back massage. They have Chinese, Thai and Taiwanese girls. 

You can ask for Kitty (Hong Kong) or Eva (Taiwan), both are excellent. 

Enjoy!!

Brother Lungor, nothing beats a back walk when done correctly. I have a pretty Chinese 40+ masseuse with a medicine degree back home who I occasionally see to put me straight again.. And she fun to talk with... Legitimate massage

So, I did finally see Kitty for her famous massage and back walk. I was mega stressed from work and needed to get my back loosen up before I went home. The shop is conveniently located in Town Hall, however due to its position, there is a lot of ambient noise and the 'rooms' are just curtained off. However, they do try and blanket the noise with some background music.

As Lungor said, she starts of with lots of kneading type moves with towels on my back. Using her thumbs and then elbows, she was able to get in deep into the knots and shoulder blades. Once she was happy that I had loosen up, she got on the table and performed her back walk magic on me. Using the toes to get into the small muscles to the back of the heel, she was able to release a lot of tightness from my back. The hour went quickly and felt great afterwards.

It was actually $70/hr which I thought was quite expensive but you do get health insurance rebate.

Was she best back walker that I have had? Probably not but certainly a black belt. I really enjoyed it when Sasa and her sister at 501 King St in Newtown did it for me. They actually used oil and with the pressure of their feet, it felt fantastic. Also, knowing that they were going to make your balls explode after the magic back walk, it just seemed perfect :-)

Yeah, the Sasa and Jojo sisters acts at 501 !, those were the good old days, both from Hong Kong, both very Busty and sensual, love them. I think it was only Sasa who did the back walk using oil, Jojo did it the traditional way over the towel. There was another MILF there called Cici at around the same time who also did a good massage and back walking, and she only worked on Thursday. Only tried her once, was pretty good!

Cheers

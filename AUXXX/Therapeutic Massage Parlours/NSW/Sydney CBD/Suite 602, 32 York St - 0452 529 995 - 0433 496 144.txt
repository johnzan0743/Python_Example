My experience/comments : 

Was tipped of about this pleace by a mate of mine and desiced to check it out. The place is on the 6th floor of a buliding so a fairly discreet street frontacge wghich was good.

Turned up and had to ring the bell to get in which was a good sign and was greated by Elaine, a cute but curvy thai girl.

As i was still 50/50 on the legitimicy of this place i toolk the hour option and undressed for the massage. Massage was fantastic and of a reasonable quality with loads of incidental touching of the sack.

on the flip i was covered with a towel which i though was strange but again there was touching of the sack.

Then the magic question came to which i answerd yes. i was offered tug and underss for $50. i acepted and it was happy days from there on in.

Good value with a decent massage and standard rates on extras.

WIR: sure for that level of massage with a good end.

We may need ozboy to confirm, as he has quoted Suite 604 which I did find through Google but the link had expired so no further details were available.

i checked this place out. Ozboy is correct. The Sabai Herbal Massage & Spa details aren't. That shop was the previous occupant. As the new people are a HJ massage place, 'Sabai' better update their website asap.

It's Thai girls working, but the setup is very a Chinese HJ massage joint. $60HR with dirty floors and that paper thingy cloth placed on the bench. Won't be going back. Had a massage by 'Summer' a large thai girl who also works at a Chinese HJ shop on sussex street. It was anything but a Thai Aromatherapy massage. Nice girl who loves a chat but not my type of thing as i gave up on the Chinese style massage years ago.

Ventured here today and the place is called Dahar Massage - sorry will have to get the number

Strangest punt I have had so far

Rang the door and Emmy opened the door - cute little Thai lass. She said how longer 30 mintues $40 is the damage
Went into the room and they have the old sliding doors you got in a caravan when I was a young fella - they look like an accordian. Got naked and she came in and
put a towel over the bottom parts. Thought bugger this place has gone legit.

So for the next 20 minutes an average massage ensured. Unfortunately at this time another punter came to the door and yet another rang the phone and Emmy must
have been the only girl around so off she went to help the fellow punters. Directed one to a room a couple of doors down and said I'll be about 15 to him. Bugger again

Ok she comes back and starts to work on the back of the legs and little tackle tickles started happening - I thought mmm could be on here. Turned over and asked if
extras were available - yep $20 for HJ - $50 for nude - bit late for the nude selected HJ. She no worries but I have to get another girl to do it WTF

Said OK and she went and in walked a dumpy Annie and said you want HJ - said OK and off she went - touching allowed outside but that was it - after a not to bad HJ got over the line.

She left and in walked Elaine to clean up - talk about tag team

I wonder if they wanted 3 tips mmmm

Will I go back mmm maybe not

I was meeting a friend for lunch near here,  a fortnight ago.  I arrived earlier and decided to reconnoitre this establishment.  Essentially it is a building with a range of small offices.  I saw a slim young Chinese lady walking past the glass door.  After the lunch I returned.  The same lady answered the door and took me to the cubicle. She left and Annie, a plump, dumpy, bored looking Thai, mid 30s returned.  Bummer. Perhaps she makes up with expertise, I hoped. $40 for 30 mins was the price. Seriously crap massage ensued. Idle strokes.not relaxing, not erotic. Just tedious.  Then turn over.  $20 for hj, $50 naked proposed. Compounding my follies, I accepted the $50 proposal.  Tits or bum she asked, meaning which way should see face.  She latched on with a vice like grip and jack hammered away, demonstrating a strength, stamina and athleticism not apparent  from her dumpy body.   Bruised and battered I staggered out, vowing never to return. Worst ever.

I just tried this place again today.

What a dump. Saw Uma, plumpish thai girl for 30 mins $40. 

Massage was just pushing oil around ny body but the tackle tickle was good and welcomed. $40 for nude HJ but bra was just around waist and pants around ankles.

The place has not been cleaned since i was there last. Filthy floor and god knows what on the sheets.

At the end she was so unorganised she had to leave the room for tissuse for the clean up.

i will not be heading back.

Thought I'd try this place again

walked through the door and this time asked upfront do you HJ and the girl can't remember 
her name said later - i.e. other girl do.
Asked if other girl does massage and she said yes in walked Annie
She said you want HJ and I said yes and asked if nude she said $50 I said $30 and we met in the middle $40
Off go our clothes and on with the massage.
Annie does a pretty good massage - definitely got out the kinks in my shoulders and started with a bit of tackle tickle - turn overtime
and on with the main event. I started to play with her breasts - bit saggy and lightly touched her puss 'not inside OK' - while 
she tugged away at the little man. After awhile blew everywhere and a hot towel was brought for a clean up and a nice drink of water
hard work after all.

My advice is if you do go to this joint and it is OK - ask up front if the ladies do extras otherwise you may get the multi girl deal
I got the first time.

Was wondering around the city and walked past this place and wanted to see if the
service had change. Emmy answered the door - I thought oh crap here we go again - she doesn't do HJ
Asked if other girls avaliable - no but will be shortly. Didn't have the time so took the switcheroo option.
Nuded up and she started the massage - better this time - but still not great.
After the 30 mins were up she left and Laura - I think it was came and gave me a very average HJ

Will not return I have had to many dud punts here

Age : mid twenties

Size/shape : larger, size 10, c cups.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Yes-ish

My experience/comments : 
Pleasant girl pretty face although a bit plump. Fairly young. 

Rooms look pretty clean to me. Far better than some of the places down in china town. About your average Thai standard I guess, but smallish table. 

Massage was really good, started with a towel wash of the feet and no oil on the back. Walked over me on her knees, this was great. 

Bit of that before she started basting like a Christmas ham. Heaps of oil, a bit too much for my liking but a good strong massage. Moved down to my legs and gave them a good working. Hardly any tackle tickle so I was getting a bit worried. 

Turn over time and a towel is placed over my bits, signs are not looking good at all. She works the front of the legs well, but still hardly any focus on my "sensitive areas" just some very light brushing. I can see down her top to her C cups so the towel is seriously tenting at this stage. 

Finishes up the the legs and it's time. Makes the universal sign for hand relief and says is will be $20 extra. No nude is offered. I accept is she starts working on my member like a machine. Not overly pleasant and a bit to hard. Feels like she wants to get me to the finishing like quickly.  But ok enough. No talk or looking at me. 

Still, I blow soon enough and it's cleanup time and then onto a head massage. Not really my cup of tea, as it was a bit hard. 

Might try again another day. 

Facilities 6/10 
Massage 8/10
"Services" 3/10

Person's Name : Teona??

Establishment : Name on the ad board out the front says "DARAH thai massage", but the directory on the wall says "Sabai herbal massage and spa"

Date of Visit : 1 oct (Tuesday)

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 602 (lvl6) 32 York St, sydney. Entrance to the lifts between the camera store and the golf store. Very discrete. Go up the lifts and turn left.

Hours of Business : 10 AM to something

Rates :$50 for 45 min + $20 tug

Age : mid twenties

Size/shape : Slim, A-B cups, nothing special

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : not really

My experience/comments : 
Weird one, i've now experienced the switcheroo. Nice enough girl (with bad breath) started what is a pretty good massage, again waay too much oil. turn over time and a towel is placed on my junk. 30min in and she askes about the happy ending, $20. Sure, ok.

She just dissapears (I assume to get some tissues) and a new face appears. mmmm. anywho, i'll go along with this. New girl starts a very mechanical HJ. No effort, not really into it. Eventually I shoot my load and we're done.

Probably wont be back.

Hey fartichoke. I'll do a recon of the place an let you know. I suspect that 604 no longer exists, the place at 602 has just taken tier signage or have been moved to 602. 

Probably won't get a massage on the recon after the last time.

Ok. Hopefully this clears it. Only massage place is in 602. Two different names, Darah Thai Massage Therapy on the sandwich board out front and Sabai on the building directory. Both say 602. 

604 is some right to life place, from outward appearances it looks like it has been for quite some time.

Darah Thai massage

Suite 602, 
Level 6
32 York St
Sydney 2000

0452 529 995
0433 496 144

How do you get there?
This shop is very well located, halfway between Wynyard and townhall stations. An older office block with a lift

What was the place like?
A basic fitted ex office suite. Large waiting area but 2 small massage rooms.

Were there other girls there?
2 girls, one very young and pretty, the other older and not so.
I asked the youngest upfront who said only the older one provides sensual services. So the older one it was.

What about the girl?
A thick chubby asian girl, some acne scarring on her face small boobs compared to her frame
She said 26 years old, I probably believe her.
maybe a size 12 , plump and very dark nipples, thick stocky legs, said Thai, but looked more Filo with those thick stocky legs

What was her name?
Emma

What days does she work?
Sorry, I didn't ask her

What was provided?
$80 was the fare for a 30 minute hard massage and HJ from a nude asian.

Quality?
Good quality massage & good HJ. She kept her legs pressed so close together I couldn't see a thing, no touching or sucking allowed.

Oil was poured from a gravy boat, nice touch.

Price?
I paid $80 for 30 minutes.

Any extras available?
I think I was given the maximum here, she didn't want to totally remove her underclothes, but finally agreed after I suggested I would come quicker if I could see her "sexy body" properly

Cleanup?
Heaps of linty Tissues
I was not offered a shower, so possibly not available.

Would you go back?
I visited this shop when it first opened and I have only just returned, so I may visit again in a year or 2

Final comments?
Not that cheap really, If you are looking for slim young asian, probably look elsewhere.

I hope this review proves useful for my fellow punters.

I suspect the younger one is the Teona (spelling) that I had, hence i got the switcheroo when asked if I wanted any extras. The girl is ok-ish looking, rather young but she didn't have great breath when i got her.

I agree, not cheap and you can do far far better down the road at Photara Thai, same price, good facilities and a much better massage.

Drove past this place today and decided to take a punt.

$30 for 30 mins

Was keen for some extras but quickly realised this probably wasn't the place to find them.

The tables were sectioned off by curtains, so firstly noise would have been an issue. Secondly, privacy was at a premium, as when I walked past the other tables there were gaps in the curtains and you could see the other punters. Finally, I was allocated the Papasan. So even if extras were free, I wouldn't have taken them up!

Having said all this, the massage was very good, so if you are after a legit massage then it wouldn't be a bad option.

Cheers,

BAB

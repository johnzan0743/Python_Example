Person's Name: Jenny

Establishment: Tang Massage

Contact Details/Address: 62 Erskine St Sydney CBD Ph: 02 9299 6886

Hours of Business: 10am to 3am

Prices: $40 1/2 hr, $60 1hr before 9pm; $45 1/2 hr, $70 1hr after 9pm & weekends

Age: Late 40's???

Size/shape: Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Massage (not sure if RNT is also available from Jenny)

Value for money/recommend?: No/no

My experience/comments: Thought I would give this place a go to break my mini punting drought.

Parking was a breeze, however, this was after 10pm. Any earlier or on weekends I expect it would be a challenge.

Greeted by a lady who had a great rack, mid 30's, and rather attractive. Unfortunately for me she turned out to be the mamasan. She called for the ML on duty, Jenny. Not sure if any others were working, didn't see any others.

Jenny is a pleasant lady. For looks I would give her a 3/10, but she certainly would have rated a fair bit higher in her prime. She has A cups, and was wearing a dress that would not have been out of place for an evening out.

Was shown to a room on the 1st floor. This appeared to be the only one on this level, but there were stairs heading up to another level(s). No shower that I could see.

Room was clean, massage table in the centre, a couple of couches to one side, stereo playing chinese music, and a heater in one corner.

Wasn't asked about the firmness I preferred, Jenny just went with what I would call a soft massage with a hint of 'medium' every now and then. Massage was neither theraputic or sensual. Zero tackle tickle.

If a HJ had been offered I would have accepted, but as it wasn't and the fact that the ML and massage wasn't doing it for me, I didn't ask for one.

All in all I would rate the experience as a 2/10. Would like to have provided a more positive review bearing in mind this place is a sponsor of this wonderful forum, but that would be a disservice to my fellow punters.

My experience could be a one off for this place, as always, YMMV.

Cheers,

BAB

Person's Name: Lucy

Date of Visit: Last week

Age: Late 40's - early 50's

Size/shape: Medium build

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided: Massage plus HJ

Value for money/recommend?: No

My experience/comments: After a meeting earlier in the evening with a fellow punter I had the urge. Was late so opted to give this place a second chance. Lucy was the only lady working.

Paid my $45 for 1/2 hour. An average massage ensued. Was offered a HJ for $20 which I accepted, thinking that her experience should make for a pleasant encounter. Her HJ skills were OK, but nothing exceptional. She did offer to take her clothes off for an undisclosed amount. Also offered to allow me to touch under her clothes for another $15, but I declined. At that price I may as well go to a FS place and get a much younger hottie to jerk my gherkin.

As always YMMV, but for me, 2 out of 2 visits have been below expectations.

Cheers,

BAB

Establishment: Tang Massage

Contact Details/Address: 62 Erskine St Sydney CBD Ph: 02 9299 6886 / 0405 089 591

Hours of Business: 24 hours

Prices: $40 1/2 hr, $60 1hr before 9pm; $50 1/2 hr, $80 1hr after 9pm & weekends, and other prices in the fine print depending on times.

Age: Late 20's?

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend?: No/no!!!

My experience/comments: Saw the advertisement for 24 hour massage, in various locations (City, Glebe, Artarmon) with HF rebate. Curious, I called to see what this was about. Informed that city locations were Wynyard until evening and 62 Erskine St 24 hours. So one evening, found the need to give it a try at 2.30am.
Was met by a cutish late 20's? Chinese, who asked straight away "you want massage?"... should have taken that as the cue to ask what else I could possibly be getting here, but stupidly nodded in agreement and was led up the 3 sets of stairs.
Into a cold room, decked out with massage tables and oils etc. Opted for 30 mins to test, and gave out the $50 (was previously quoted $40 on the phone). The massage was not particularly good, perhaps she just couldn't be bothered at this hour. So I assumed this was a place where the extras were the specialty, and enjoyed with anticipation.
Unfortunately not to be, end of the massage, and covered in a towel (at least it was warm under it), and told "finished". I asked about extras, "hand job" she asked, "of course" I replied. With that she was out the door, and returned, after an amazing transformation into a much older, less attractive, and visibly tired ML. I joked that she looked different, but humor was not appreciated (yes, she had just been woken up). $20 was requested and paid, and on with a pretty ordinary HJ, with NO touching anything.
So all done $70 for 30 mins, and not really satisfied with this, I enquired about the HF rebate, and was pointed to the sign on the wall, of course my fund is not on the list, and can't say I recognised any of the approved funds.
I won't be back. As mentioned above, this place needs to decide what they are doing. As a legit massage, it was crap, as an RnT the finish was worse, at a price most legit places charge for an hour. The only quality may be the 24 hour availability, but next time, I will wait until the next day.

Was in that part of today and thought to see if it has changed its ways ie gone less legit
Walked in and Rose was available $40 half hour or $75 for an hour.
Since I had been burned previously took the half hour option. Got in the room and raised the query re extras. Told if I wanted a happy ending I could do it myself. Well that answered my query re if this place had changed.
The massage was ok and no I didn't take myself in hand.

I was thinking this place should go pure massage section as it is only by luck you get a hj. I will not return

Value for money/recommend?: Yes

My experience/comments: 

Was walking past this shop and noticed a big sign on the door saying that they were closing down so I decided to go and check it out. I go in and it looks like they have pretty much moved already. The whole place was empty except for the one room up the top with a lone massage table in it. I speak to Kelly and she says that they are closing the next day as the lease was not renewed. I opt for the 1 hr at $80. Kelly starts with a firm massage on my neck and back Here massage technique is very good and she comments that my right shoulder is very tight and there is a knot there which she goes to work on. I am really enjoying this therapuetic work on my body as it is quite relaxing and remedial. There are some accidental on purpose tt brushes just before the 40 minute mark as I am asked to turn over.  I really like this type of massage place that is not worried about covering your ass with a towel. The same applies on the flip and after as I am laying there totally uncover as Kelly starts to tickle my balls ever so lightly. She goes back to finishing each leg then she asks if I want a HJ. Upon receiving an affirmative response she starts slowing working on me ever so sensually. It is not long before she has worked me into a frenzy and I blow all over her hand and my stomach.

She then does a nice cleanup and finishes me off with a relaxing head massage and then I pay the extra $20 for HJ.

Pity it is the last day here as  really enjoyed it. She mentioned that she could be going to one of Lily's othere shops.

I guess this thread can be moved to the closed section now.

Maybe, but the owners would be keen to get customers in the new address (see Wachumba's post) so I can't see they wouldn't accept your coupon and welcome you with open arms.

Heard from above that these guys had moved and though i would check out the new digs. went up the lift and rang the doorbell and was greeted by Kelly or Kemi or something like that. a 40+ lady who is thin as a rake.

Into a room that was jam packed with equipment for beauty treatments but table was clean enough. massage was OK at best but there was loads of crack play and TT. on the flip was offered HJ for $20. followed with a nice foot rub and out the door.

For $90 all up it was way to overpriced compared with Phatora thai up the road. Phatora is $100 al up but the massage is way better and the girls are way younger.

On the plus it is a very discreet entrance if that's your concern.

Services Provided : Massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 
Thought I'd try the new digs to see if the service was better than last time. Went there without an appointment and the
door was shut/locked. Rang the number for Lily and she said no worries be there in 10 minutes, new girl didn't come.
OK says I'll walk around the block and meet you here in 10.

Lily turns up in 10 good to her word and says that she will give me extra massage for waiting i.e. 45 for 30 minutes - OK says I. 
Pay over the money and ask straight up about a handy and she says fine - I pay the extra 20. Nothing else on offer. She
leads me to a room and it is obvious that a whole lot of other beauty treatments take place here - stuff everywhere - very messy.

Strip off and onto the bed, we start talking about places I have visited in China and she starts to relax and provide a nice massage. At the
35 minute mark in the massage turns naughty with crack play and a great tackle tickle. Turnover time - you very horny man - no crap
you have just been playing with my old fella for about 10 minutes and I have a have a  serious  woody. She now starts playing with my cock, balls etc. 
My hands start to roam boobs - no go. arse and pussy through clothes OK. This goes on for another 5 minutes or so until I blow a big wad of goo.
You very horny man. Clean up and back on the street.

BTW Tang are opening a new shop near the Apple store and Maccas 8/8 - supposed to spa bathes etc. If you go to clarence st and book
for the new place 50% discount on a massage.

Went to this place as i was in the area and wanted a shore thing so didn't take the extra punt at lvl 1 of this place.

Anyway was assigned Jane who i recognized works in Tang massage in the hunter connection. she confirmed this and stated that she works here on Wednesdays. Solid massage with plenty of ball rubbing and a decent ending with touching allowed.

The interesting thing was she confirmed that she gave the same service at hunter connection. for those who don't know the place its a hole in the wall with a curtain covering you from the busy walk way. This may be of interest for the adventure loving amongst us who want to lve on the edge.

No. The shop on Level 2 is still related to Tang Massage. It was called Bella Beauty salon and has the same owner as the ex tang at 62 Erskine st and the hole in the wall shop on Hunter connection Wynyard station.  She also has a shop in Glebe and 88a Hampden.

The new shop called QVB massage is on Level 1 and not related to Level 2. The link above is for level 1 and whilst it is called QVB it should not be confused with the shop across the road from QVB at level 1 139 York st.

In city and noticed the sign for massage for Tang - used to go to Erskine street previously so thought I would give a go 
anyway it was same as then 40- for weak massage 20 for rnt with some touching that was clinical and not much fun 

I prefer near central station on elizabeth st or pure massage where you get full body to body for less $ with touching and nice earlicking from girls 
Wynyard have good massage as well which is bonus

I was originally heading to 139 but everyone was busy
Tried QVB which is just below busy
7 Lotus busy
So as I was in the area rang and asked for lily, yep
avaliable I'll be there in 5. Got there and no Lily -
 should have walked. But thought would give another girl Cindy a go
Tits b cup
Size a bit chubby to solid
Arse a bit big
Anyway paid for 30 -$40 and $20 for the HJ
She did offer nude with touching all over for an
additional $50 so $70 all up. I declined.

So stripped and onto the bed, I won't bore you 
with the details but it has to be the worst massage I
have ever had. A budgie walking across my back would
have been better. Asked for hard got piss weak.

Turnover time and a mechanical HJ followed she did allow all
over touching through her clothes. Eventually got over the
line thinking about Chanel sucking on my old fella.

Cleaned up and back on the street

So thought will have to be quiet.

She walked in and say me nude and asked if I wanted a HJ 20 or BJ $30 for the BJ so I took that option. For the next 25 minutes
or so a good massage with a little bit of TT happened. Turn over time and she started a slow HJ and then smiled and bent over
to suck my hard cock, BBBJ nice. She did a slow and quiet one so the people next door couldn't hear. I tapped her on the
shoulder to let her know I was going to blow and she kept sucking and I CIMed until she couldn't take anymore and I blew the
rest on my stomach. Clean up and out of the place.

Just went for a look for this place. It's closed at the moment ;(

Address if you're struggling to find it is: H17 Hunter Arcade. Checked the place and it says "tang massage". It's the underground walk way that crosses under George st. It's on the right side near the Wynyard station end. As you walk away from te station.

You can call out to them and they will tell how long

Went by at about 11am on Friday but the shutters are down... I wonder if they open late ? Pity, I am usually around about 10:30 so an early start would be perfect...  Anyway..

I returned (with fingers crossed) at 4:30 and saw they were open. I couldn't see anyone out the front and noticed the room on the left had sheet closed..... I turned around to leave the arcade and noticed a girl sitting on a chair in front of a massage table reading a book - Quite hidden.   I walked in and said hello... She was a bit shocked and I said massage.

I said a 30 min massage and she quickly pushed me near the table and closed the curtain... I usually negotiate at this time but didn't get the chance...   Anyway, the table not he right is hard against the wall, so you can't put your arms down which is a bit of a pain... Anyway, I strippoff and Cindy returns.  It's a pretty ordinary massage but she didn't venture between my legs, so I was worried that the extras were off the table....

Anyway, at the flip I ask if she does HJ and she says yes, I then ask for Blow job and she says no, but will do b2b touch all over for $50...   So that makes it $40 for massage and $50 for naked....  Hmmm, she was young and sorta pretty (only works Fridays) and I say sure.   

She strips off and does a basic b2b which was really just rubbing her tits on my chest...  I did my usual grab and feel with the left and my right explores between her legs from behind.  She was fine with this and even seemed pretty wet.  While lacklustre in the massage department, she certainly knows how to make you blow fast, and it only managed minimal insertion into her wet pussy before blowing..... 

Had a chat after and she seems pretty nice....

Overall, a good time, but probably just a bit pricey for what you get.

It's funny that me and her are totally naked getting groped by each other in hunter arcade less than a metre from the hundreds of people walking tot he train....  Only a light sheet between us...  That's probably worth the price alone..

Person's Name : Nikita - or something like that

 Establishment : Tang Wynyard station

 Date of Visit : Around Christmas 2013

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

 Hours of Business : 3pm

 Rates : $40 - 30 mins + $20 HJ

 Age : 25 she said

 Size/shape : C cups with a little bit of fat - solid looking

 Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

 Services Provided : massage + HJ

 Value for money/recommend? : Hell no

 My experience/comments : 
Walked passed and thought I would see if Sophie was around a BBBJ with massage for $70 was worth another go. Alas
she was not there and only one girl was on at that time Nikita. Said OK paid for the massage and asked for the handy straight up.
I find this works well as it removes any misunderstandings from the beginning and everyone is aware of the services to be
provided. Stripped off and climbed onto the bed. Pretty ordinary massage with heaps of oil - not good with no showers around
and you have to get dressed again. Turnover time and the worst HJ I have ever had commenced - that was 2 punts in a row
for me - between that and Jenny at Photara. Tried touching no go - could play with her butt and then she moved away. After a
bloody long time - she had to change hands - I blew - clean up took ages with slightly warm towels - dressed and got out of there

I will not return... unless I walk past and see Sophie

Person's Name : Cindy. Works Fridays 

Establishment : Tang Wynyard station. H17 hunter arcade

Date of Visit : Friday 14th March

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : h17 hunter arcade. Below the train station in the walkway under George st

Hours of Business : from about 11 till 7 m-f. But closed at random times it seems

Rates : $40 - 30 mins + $20 HJ

Age : 30s

Size/shape : About a 10. Solid. C cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese. Hunjzou

Services Provided : massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend?: meh. Some may like though

My experience/comments : sought this place out during the Friday afternoon rush hour. Saw some nice legs poking out from behind the curtain and figured I'd give it a go, for the team you see. 

The legs were attached to a fairly solid looking Chinese girl who ushered me in to the available massage table at the back and quickly shut the curtains. $40 was exchanged upfront for the 30min service and I was asked to strip. A little anxious as I was pretty exposed save for the curtains clipped together with the sounds of the walkway coming in. 

I nude up and and lay face down for the massage. She returns and commences said massage. The massage is pretty good, although delivered from one side as the table is up against the wall. Good amount of pressure and not tooo much oil. Her English is very good and we get a hushed conversation going (I can hear everything going on with the table next to me and assume they can hear us). Turns out she's from Hangzhou, here studying etc etc. 

Massage continues without the slightest hint of tackle tickle and she asked me to turn over. At this point, she gestures to MiniMaid's point and makes the universal HJ symbol. That's an extra $20 or she can "take off" for $50. I estimate she's more attractive with the kit on so I opt for the $20 HE. She re confirms I don't want the kit off... No thanks honey. 

She starts a surprisingly excellent HJ. Very slowly working up to climax and blowing on my dick. This is good. The sounds from the arcade are really loud, I can hear some kid whining to his dad about buying something. Really not for me, but if you like the feeling of danger then this could be a great location. 

As the HJ progresses I'm given good access through her clothes to both upstairs and downstairs regions and eventually I blow. Rather satisfying. 

She cleans up and the restarts the massage on the front of my legs for a few minutes. She realised we've gone a bit overtime and pops out to get some hot towels. Cleans me up and sends me on my way. 

Probably won't be back, didn't like the noises an not great value for a nude HJ at $90 for 30min. Some may really like this though.

Walk by Tang today and wasn't really looking to enter, but i saw a smoking hot brazillian chick sitting on the chair ready...   WOAH !   I walk past, have a think for a few minutes.. then go back.

I walk in and ask for 30 mins....  She says fine and asks for $40 payment up front...  I pay her and make sure i have $20 in my pocket ready for extras...   As soon as i walk in she closes the curtains and says to get undressed through the curtains...   Damn, no time to advise my requirements...

Anyway, i nude up and lay on the table...  She reappears after a few minutes but doesn't cover me, just does a typical "senusal" massage on my back... which after a while was way too repetitive and boring...   She was nowhere near my ass and didn't even consider touching my legs....  I thought i would push the point at the turn over, but wait......     next thing, the curtain is closed and she pokes her head around saying thank you, you can get dressed now...

WTF !   how bad is this girl trained...     I then here her say to boss lady that she is getting lunch and the boss lady says NO, you go later.

I was pretty dissapointed and won't be back anymore, much better value elsewhere....  I don't usually mind a poor massage if a good tug is involved, but in this case, just poor...

PITY as well,  she was Smoking Hot !!

Hehe. I also had a little walk past today, was going to ask for a quick handy, just an old woman sitting at the back. Other curtain closed, probably some punter getting the same experience! Lucky I didn't see the Brazilian. 

If I see her might be worth asking for HE upfront. If no, I walkies. Thanks for the intel.

After hearing from a friend, I went to check out this place at the station. Its dirt cheap (only 35 dollars for 30 mins and 15 dollars for hand job.   However the downside of the place is that there is only a curtain and a small door separating you and the rest of the people walking on the station. The mature Asian woman gives an excellent massage and a cheap handjob. But no privacy and bad location.

There is another one as soon as you enter the hunters arcade, opposite " ....... chef sushi and Japanese food place". It is exactly (under the escalator) towards your right as soon as you enter.   Dont go there ever!  i went there once and she forcefully asked for 20 bucks even though i didnt ask for a handjob and when i said no she started yelling and  making a scene.  I finally said ok and she gave the worst hand job on earth and btw she is ugly  and in her 40's.

Just to guide you further on this place which you must avoid (it has a board saying for lease ) i guess its about to go on lease anytime soon.

I thought this place was Tangs. The only time I went the massage was $40 for 30 minutes and the HJ was $20 but perhaps it has changed.

Confirming the one towards the station end of the tunnel connecting hunter connection to wynyard station is Tang's massage (opposite the vietnamese restaurant). 

The other one that is at the bottom of the Hunter St entrance to the same tunnel (effectively directly under the Hunter Connection food court) is called Green Massage.

pretty sure based on the location and description it's the same place in this thread.

http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f57/ta...9-6886-a-4463/

not bad for a cheap handy, and some might enjoy the thrills of being serviced in the middle of a busy walkway, with nothing more than a flimsy curtain between you and the traffic.

Hi Gang,

I love this thread.

A few good punts and some really crook ones, but all well written!

I especially like the part where the ML said he could do the handjob himself!

Thanks Jack... As they say that's punting

BTW- they also have a shop on level 2 199 Clarence st
and I was walking past and thought they are still here and
had some time to kill and went upstairs. Crap is the kindest
word - place is ok bit massage and HJ not worth the price.
Thought I would take one for the team as no one had been here for
awhile. Simple won't return better offerings in town

TANGS MASSAGE H17 Hunter Arcade between George, Pitt & Hunter St. The SeaRay was in the CBD and walking down this old Arcade noticed this shop was a small open area with 2 massage tables exposed to all walking past in which the M.L's close the Curtin's which does look tacky & interesting ... also further along is Greens Massage under the Hunter Street escalators, it's a pity Sydney is freezing cold today otherwise I would have popped into one for a RnT

Hi Gents,

Was walking past the place above in Hunter connection and noticed that there is now a proper room built in this small area rather than the curtains that used to be there.

Not sure if this means more will be on offer or not but thought i would share the intel.

Oz.

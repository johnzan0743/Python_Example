My experience/comments: (Here you must have at least 1 full sentence - "Ill be back" or "good value" is not a sentence or review. 20 word minimum please)

Initially I went to this place just to get my stressed back massaged, but when I saw this guy I said that I really wanted to get a real hard massage from a guy. Knowing that he's the only guy around, he became my masseur. And Im not even sure how gay massage works here because it was really explicit in front of the counter that states 'strictly no sexual services offered'

Anyway, i stripped to my undies and he started massaging my back. pulling my undies down. the way he touched my body is really electrifying. especially when he massaged my butt his hands really passed through my hole, to my balls. at that point i got a hard on. he asked me to turn the other side exposing my full erected manhood. he massaged my thighs going up to on the sides of my crotch and gently touching and teasing me. 

i honestly was not looking for a sexual thing when i went here. i was satisfied with his sensual massage. i love the teasing part and how his elbows rubbed real hard on my dick. it was sensational. 

he works on sundays and tuesdays.

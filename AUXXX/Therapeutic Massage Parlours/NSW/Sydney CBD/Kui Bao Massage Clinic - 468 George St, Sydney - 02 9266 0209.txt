Hey does anyone know if there is a RnT operating in George St CBD like near Mick Simmons store opposite QVB?

The reason for asking is just before Christmas I was walking down George St towards city when I saw, standing next to a door, a Chinese girl with pamphlets offering massage. I walked past and then stopped to turn back to get a pamphlet and see how she reacted as an alarm bell went off. But a younger guy dressed in t-shirt, who I had seen walking towards me, obviously had the same thought and had already approached her. By the way he leaned over to talk to her and the way she nodded in that Asian way, I reckon more than a massage was on offer. They both walked inside. People walking down the street, busy pre-Christmas shopping time, also looked as though it was a bit edgy too.

So fellow punters - any one able to tell me more? Or is my imagination and radar running wild?

I was in town today and went here to satisfy my curiosity. It is next to Lowes. On the first floor is a barber you can see down the hall. The place called Kau Bao (I think) is on the 4th floor. there is a lift.

It seems to be a low rent low cost genuine massage place. I opened the door to find a small room fitted out with 3 massage cubicles. A young guy was playing on his phone. An older (40s) lady had just finished with a client and there was a guy in the 2nd cubical I could hear.

I asked for a 30 minute massage for $35. Went in and off with the gear face down. In came the 40s lady who proceeded to give me a professional massage that was worth every cent. Wehen she flipped me over I had a bit of a roger from her massaging my butt. She groped inner thighs and all around tackle which swoll up to a half fat but she didnt offer HJ. But it was flopping against her hands as she worked away. I had my eyes closed with a smile ost of the time.

Sign says health care refunds.

Summary is that I think this might be a genuine massage place. THINK. So if you are working in that area and want a good cheap fair-dinkum massage I recommend it. But as far as I could tell NOT a RnT.

Hellyeah,

I've been to this place a number of times hoping to get a HJ as well as a mightily fine massage, they have had an enormous titted young thing doing the rubbing and I thought I may be able to negotiate with her, but no, not a thing.

This one is legit,....damm

I am going to move this to pure massage.

Kui Bao Acupuncture and Natural Therapy centre
Suite 407, Level 4, 468 George St

Mrs Rose Dong is the lady in charge - or so it said on the business card

near Lowes
(02) 9266 0209, 0421 252 980

7 days 10-8pm

After reading the reviews above I called in a while ago, A dingy building and entrance and not much better upstairs. 

I was directed to a room and a girl was allocated to me. She was from Taiwan and very pretty wearing red top and jeans. 
The massage began as normal and she tried hard, but didn't seem to quite do much for me. A bit of anticipation on my part was not met. It was a little frustrating so I tried to direct her with a few welcoming moans when she did my thighs and buttocks, but she never really reached far in between and seemed to be trying hard not to go there. Well she succeeded and didn't go there.
All in all a fairly unexciting massage and while the lady in charge asked me how it was afterwards. I replied politely that it was nice and asked if she would do the massage next. She said she would next time, though I haven't been back.

And I probably won't be.

I used to see Rose a hell of a lot in her previous locations in the Haymarket area. She gave a good massage, good hj and was health fund approved. Then a few years ago she moved to George Street. I went a few times but on the last visit she announced mid-massage that she no longer was providing hj's (something to do with having female customers and lack of privacy). I had to plead to get one more, just for old time's sake, which she did. Haven't been back since.

Business pressures have won out and Rose is back doing HJ's, in fact she left me during a massage to go finish another client off as the nominated girl wasn't interested.

She now stay open until 9pm+ and has 3 girls on during that time.

She does have females clients drop in, but she just turns the kettle on and the music up.

The opening of a Thai joint down on a lower floor is probably the driver for all these changes.

Services Provided : Massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend?  Ok



Made an easy decision during the day yesterday for an after work city punt. As near my work there are a fair bit of options, but made this particular decision to try out this joint as I never been here previously. 

Even though there is lift once you enter the narrow foyer, I opted to take the stairs, yep, four flights of stairs to reach level 4. On the way I notice there was 'Tang Massage' entrance sign on one of the doors on Level 2, not too sure of they recently moved into this building however, the main sign on the door had the standard "Tang Massage' signage/ symbol, so I will imagined in line with the other same franchises, extras would have been on the table.

Moving along, when I reached the 4th floor, I opened the door which had the  Kui Bao sign, once I entered the room, there was two Chinese MILF's getting up top greet me, from what they wearing, you have guessed who was running the joint and the actually ML worker. 

Now the ML that looked like the mamasan was called Anna, late 40's or even early 50's and not the prettiest MILF around. Was actually hoping it was Rose as made reference in this thread, as my chances in getting a HJ was good, 

It seems this whole building has not been renovated from the 1950's, but the elevator facilities are at least a decade old. The actually rooms, are not better, not quite spacious, on the right hand side, there are three massage cubicles. 

I decided to take the $60/hour massage option, so I was escorted into one of the massage cubicles by the ML worker, she laid down a fresh head paper towel on the pillow and went outside. I stripped down and laid on the massage table face down.

I will say this joint stunk of a bad odour, not too sure it was caused due the rain that day or the place has not been thoroughly cleaned for a very long time, it wasn't pleasant at all.

Anyway, both Anna the ML came in with Anna asking me where I would like the ML to concentrate and what pressure I would like, etc, etc,. It appears the ML did not know much English which didn't bother me. I told Anna what I required, she explained it all the ML. Anna left and the ML placed a light sheet over from my lower back down to the legs.

She applied Baby oil on my back and started right into the Oil Massage. I wouldn't say the best Oil Massage I had but adequate. 

Meanwhile, within the space of a few minutes there was a female and a male client that walked in right after the other.. Anna took to the female client and the male was allocated another ML. Didn't notice this other ML when I initially walked in, must have been downstairs. Actually she sounded like a younger ML as the male punter was doing his best to impress her in non stop conversation. Yeah right Pal, I'm sure by the end of the massage she will ask you to move in with youÂ…it was a little annoying.

Back to me, after receiving a reasonable massage on my shoulders and back, she moved down my lower back and thighs, this stage the bed lined sheet was not removed from my back, it was pushed to one side while my left thigh and leg were being attended.  

Then all of all sudden, Anna walked in and asked 'How was the massage....'? 'Yeah, it's good....' was my reply. She then asked me if I wanted to have my feet massaged for $10, I quickly refused and she went straight out of the room.

Again back to the massage, no hint of sensual manoeuvrers while massaging my upper legs and thighs so I guess getting any extras out of this ML was 50/50. Was asked to turn over and told her to focus on my crouch area and upper inner thighs. She did service me well in that area, but still no intentional touching of my private parts. By then I was almost barred up and I got her attention and face her 'wanking' sign with my left wrist. She just looked at me and mentioned something in Chinese, after a couple of minutes, in walked Anna and the other ML left. Anna smiles at me and told me if it was okay if she could finish the massage, so, of course I said ok.

After softy massaging my stomach for a minute, she removed the linen sheet and pointed to my erected penis. She put up three fingers, I nodded and smiled back at me. She applied baby oil on my dick and started the pre teasing tug with one hand, while she was softly caressing my balls and sac with the other. The This soft teasing continued for a couple of minutes more, I was actually getting quite aroused, yeah, this particular experience ML was doing the job which was surprising. Then the tugging become more repetitious but still a medium hold on my shaft

I started to softly moan and she paced her fingers near her mouth indicating to keep it hush, still had the male punter in the next cubicle being massaged. And yes, still prolonging his conversation with his ML. 
'
Her tugging became quicker and placed her other hand on my balls so he can give them another soft rub. It didn't take long to reach climax, I actually blew a fair bit out much to her amazement. Actually, there was not tissue boxes in the room, she mentioned something in Chinese and then soon the original ML I had first came in with a couple of warm wet hand towels.

After a good wipe down, got up and got dressed. I paid her $90 in total, the way she looked at me she had the impression I was to about to give her $100 for a slight tip, maybe next time.

Now, as I mentioned before, not certain if this Anna MILF is the co mammas an with Rose, but had no complaints with the HJ I received,

When I came out of the cubicle, she handed me a glass of warm water and we had a brief discussion of the many ML joint's in this city area. Admittedly she metioned at times it can be hard to attract clients as due to the competition around. With comments like this you can almost guarantee you will be serviced with extra's, may not with your first assigned ML, but you most probably will be looked after with Anna.

Sorry, didn't ask Anna's work roster, if she is one of the mamasan then I guess 5 or 6 days a week.

Not too sure how quickly I will return, a couple of negatives, that annoying stench and chatterbox punter in the next cubicle.

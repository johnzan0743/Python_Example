Tucked away on George st among the many other Thai massage establishments, this one is up a few flights of tight stairs. Small but comfy reception, plenty of signs saying "no special", "no happy ending", "no sex". It was a fairly quiet Sunday afternoon, only saw one other customer despite many rooms.

Plenty of rooms, and separated into groups of three by doors, so quite private. Got a 120 minute massage and probably should have asked for more - she was good and did a great job with some problematic muscles that normally only my physio can relax. Other masseurs either cause pain or give up.  She kept well clear of my groin - as in probably about 15cm so I was worried by legs would only be half done, which disappointed me, but she seemed to know what she was doing as I felt the muscles relax. Perhaps it was the tent I was raising by that point (good massages have that affect on me, even if it's not what I was after at the beginning!)

Not many places offer 180 minute Thai massage but I think I'll try next time I'll try at least 150 min. 
After the massage she left - must have been knock off time, one of the young men handled the money and provided the herbal tea. 

I was looking for a massage with no happy ending and that's what I got. Problem is good massages make me horny, so I was wanting a happy ending by that stage!

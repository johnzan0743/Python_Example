 My experience/comments : 
Got a massage from a reasonably attractive French girl.
but I also got a severe oil bath, so much so that I did actually start to chuckle at 1 point. I wouldn't really call it a massage, just rubbing a bit of oil on me and then top it up. 
got pretty boring pretty quickly and also cold fro being drenched in oil. was offered extras but I refused based of the crapness so far. 
was given a minor towel down to remove the oil, but most of it was left on, I looked like a braised turkey ready to be cooked for Christmas. 
the girl was going to leave it at that but I snatched the towel off her n tried to wipe off more oil.

didn't ask for the girls name. wasn't really interested.
but I doubt there are too many French 1's at the same place

Broadway Massage 287 Broadway (was prev Tang's Massage)
As Tiny1234 posted above, this is a strange RnT, today I felt like a nude MILF Massage and popped in her thinking there would be an older Asian M.C.L. that may get her gear off and I too was greeted by the very young French Lass that showed me into a very dark curtained off area which have very loud Hippie Music, it was so dark I could not see where I was going and she could only offer an 1/2 Hour for $40.... and she told my to take all my clothes off. the place was very dark and felt musty and when she returned, she poured a hell of a lot of oil on my back then asked if I wanted her to do a fully nude HJ for and extra $100 (I soon told her $20 only and that I didn't want nude as I have been ripped of to many times and she reduced it to $60 plus the $40 massage for a 1/2 hour, I said NO $20 for the handy and she asked if I wanted my money back (even though I was covered in oil) so I said yes and I left.....she recons she does not get an of the massage money as it goes to the house and she only works for tips, I told her if she is trying to pull this trick, she will not built up any customers plus she was too sweet and young to be pulling old blokes Dick's

We should all take a leaf out of Searay's book and stand our ground!!  Well done!

These scammers get away with it far too often using our fragile state of mind once our cocks are hard.

Persons Name: Jasmin

Establishment: Shiatsu Massage? 

Date Of Visit: Nov 2016

Contact Details: Sorry lads theres nothing online about the shop that l can find

Rates: $40/30min + $40 Nude HJ

Age: Late 30s

Size/Shape: sz 10, little fat covering, b cups, 5'6

Nationality/Ethnicity: Thai

Value For Money?: Alright

Driven past this building for years. Its right on the corner of Derwent Lane about 150m up Parramatta Rd from Kings Court Massage, towards Sydney Uni. Its an exposed shop/building so l checked around the back for a discreet entry. Bingo. Back door.

Greeted by a pleasant older Thai girl. Very touchy feely while she was telling me about the price etc. 

Agreed on 30mins for $40. 

Place seems to consist of two rooms. One upstairs and one downstairs. Went in the one downstairs. Huge room with a full Jacuzzi and couch in it. 

Stripped nude, no towel used, nice massage ensued. Lots of touching. Flip and she works my legs. Slowly brushing my piece until she offers a HJ. $40 nude HJ. I accept. I sit on the couch and Jasmin kneels in front of me while jerking me till l shoot on her titties. 

Jasmin is telling me next time she wants to use the Jacuzzi. Lol. Other extras are probably available. 

Also mentioned there are two European chicks on another day but wouldnt tell me when!

Barbara started working for the tangs group of shops before she was at Ally's. she even had Gumtree ads. I dropped in looking for Victoria and saw her and realised it was her.

Victoria is only at Ally's as far as I know. Sorry, I meant I dropped into Ally's and barbara was there so I saw her face and realised she worked at tangs Artarmon previously. Never been to 287 Broadway so don't know anything about there

Person's Name : Jasmine

Establishment : Tangs massage

Date of Visit : Feb 17

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 287 Broadway Glebe, Tang spa beauty & massage

Hours of Business : 10-10

Rates : $70/hr

Age : Late 30's

Size/shape : sz 10-12, b cups, chubby around the waist

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

 Services Provided : massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Value if using voucher. 

My experience/comments : Went here with a voucher which got me a 1 hr massage for around $35. Rang the buzzer and nobody answered so went around the back. Still had to buzz twice before someone came to the door. I was on time for my massage but told to wait a 1 girl hadnt shown up. Didnt get a choice of girls and ended up with Jasmine. Put me into the another room so i didnt see the other punter when he left. The room smelt like a mix of smoke and mold.  THere was mold on the walls in some places so not that clean. At least they use disposable table sheets.

Lied down nude and there was no towel to cover up. Jasmine came back and started the massage uncovered which was nice. Her massage was actually quite good and relaxing i could have fallen asleep. Quite a few stroke in the butt crack and brushing the balls. Turned over and left uncovered again. She started working on the legs and intentionally brushed my cock and as it grew, she smiles and asked what was happening there.  Asked if i wanted extras and just asked for a HJ. She said $30 but agreed on $20. Nude also available but i didnt like her body. HJ was quite good. Hot towel to clean up.
I saw Anna waiting when leaving. She looked very old, but skinny but not my type.  Barbara (South American) from Ally's is also here on Monday and Tuesday after 4pm according to the roster on their wall but that may be old as a previous review said she was there on a Thursday.

Hi Guys,

Was walking past this place today and noticed a sign.

Sydney CBD Massage - Asian Style Relaxation and Full Body Massage

while I am temporarily out of punting action I couldn't help checking it out.

Discreet entrance into an office block right next to grand royal Thai massage. up the lift and as it opened cute girl gave me a smile. As it was only a reccy I stayed in the lift and went on my way.

Googled them later and found the above website and they are advertising on Cracker so its definitely a new RT joint.

I will check it out when i am back in the saddle but in the meantime happy punting.

Yes, I noticed this place recently also. Like ozboy, I too am out of the punting scene for a number of weeks but as this place is convenient for me, I am keen to give it a try.

Haven't had a chance to write a review yet, but I also TOFTT on Tuesday. The receptionist was very cute, but doesn't do massage. I saw Blair who is about 23 and quite attractive. Mediocre massage, and ordinary Part 2. Could possibly improve with some effort and guidance, but given the wide choice in the city, you may want to try elsewhere.

Fuper ,you have just confirmed the exact point I was trying to make in my original post .Have a look at the girls listed & the roster .There is NO" BLAIR" any where to be seen .
These joints really piss me off with their FALSE advertising .Yes the receptionist was cute BUT I walked & told her why I was walking .
There is a place on the south side that continually does the same thing but I will not name because of x1!%%$#*&% reasons !!!
Cheers

Only a few of these places have genuine photos and descriptions of their providers. Most photos are generic ones that the web designers use, so never, ever chase these phantom girls they have in the images on the site. If you do you will be sorely disappointed I am afraid. There is terrific licence in their unaccountable advertising, even worse than that you see on TV for washing powders and the like.

Funny you say that Wot and I don't want to hijack this thread, but I have long said that washing powders are one of the great cons of modern advertising. I haven't used one yet that gets a genuine stain out of anything. Perhaps useless modern resources/devices could be a whole thread of its own.

Person's Name : Blair

Establishment : Level 2, 100 Clarence St

Date of Visit : 14 July 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :.

Hours of Business : 10am to 8pm 7 days

Rates : $55 for 45mins

Age : early 20s

Size/shape : Size 6 B cups (lovely)

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage & nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : So so

My experience/comments : 


Following intelligence, I decided to take one for the team. 

On arrival my hopes were very high having been met by a very friendly and attractive receptionist. She lead me to a very well appointed room to discuss how long I would stay. I was prepared to stay forever, but then found out she was the receptionist, and not available for the massage. Bummer! 

Anyway, I'm here to TOFTT, so I take the next available. pay $55 for 45mins.

So Blair arrives, and she is very cute. Probably about 23yrs and 160cms with a very pert little figure. Things are looking up again. Get undressed and ask up front if B2B available - yes, so I hand over $50 up front. She asks if I want the massage first or second - I took this as a positive sign of things to come, and thought I can leave the fun part til last. 

The massage itself was of average standard. However she was a good conversationalist. Studying business at uni  so English was good, and she has a fun sense of humor. All looking very positive. 

Anyhow, the massage drags and there is little tackle touching, or much in the way of sensual going on. Off for the hot towel, a quick wipe down, and then I hear the clothes being shed. Yay... Here we go! 

Part 2 commences and turns out to be a real let down. I need a bit of working up to get into action, but Blair was rushing to get it over with. A shame as she has a great body,  and seemed fairly relaxed with touching.  I enquired about DATY, but when told that would cost an extra 50, I quickly snapped back to reality. 


 Whether it was lack of technique, or lack of interest, it was not a good experience. I did manage to shoot after a time, but not great. 

I don't want to appear too negative - I think there is potential here, and YMMV, even if mine was limited.

Person's Name : Jenny ex Chrystal from QVB - I think it was Crystal she said

Establishment : Level 2, 100 Clarence St

Date of Visit : 27 July 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :.

Hours of Business : 10am to 8pm 7 days

Rates : $40 min plus $50

Age : early 30s I think

Size/shape : Size 8 quite solid with C cups and a big nipples

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage & nude HJ & spanish and ball licking

Value for money/recommend? : Pretty good

My experience/comments : 

Against my better judgement I decided to come here and see if it was any good - very convenient from my work and very discreet as you go up the lift from Clarence St - they have a board out the front and that is it. So went up the lift and was met by the big fat papasan - Aussie bloke. He showed me to the room at the end of the hall and called out Jenny. I arrived in the room and Jenny was there in a second and I paid over the $40 for 30 minutes. She then asked if I required anything else attended to - her English is pretty good. Asked what was on offer and she said that she would give me nude bodyslide and HJ for an additional $50. Said OK and handed over the money and stripped off and got onto the bed. To my understanding there are no showers so come here clean. The room walls that go all the way to the ceiling and are clean - not bad.

The massage was pretty good - definitely above average as she worked on my shoulders and lower back as requested, you could see she had definitely had some practice in this area. She worked her way up and down my body with no accidental TT thrown in - it was all massage at this point. AT around 20 minutes and the light feathery touches and TT started - knows what she is doing here and got me lifting off the bed for the double handed action - very nice. Turnover time and she oils herself up and starts a bodyslide - not that great but she did give me access to her tits which were natural and fun to play with. As I started to suck on her tits, my hands wandered south and started to play with her pussy and she said nothing so I continued to play. This went on for a couple of minutes and then she moved down to give me a bit of Spanish which was OK - not the best I have had but OK. I then asked her to lie down so that I could get better access to her body. She did and I played with her pussy and sucked on her tits. She started to moan - read FOAM  and I asked if DATY was on the cards and she said no - not this time. Her pussy was very wet and she started to groan loudly and I thought the big Aussie would come in and see what all the noise was about. Nothing, so continued for another minute and she gyrated madly and she came - either that or it was pretty good acting. She came quicker than most women I have been with so not sure - ego says yes. So after she had calmed down we change places. She grabs my cock and starts to lick my balls and shaft and I think here we go BBBJ maybe - no. I asked if she BJ'd and she said she did but it would be another $50 and it would be covered - made a counter off and she stayed at $50. I didn't have that on me so declined the offer. She started to tug my cock and then placed it between her tits for a bit more Spanish where I unloaded onto her tits. Lots of cream - her words - it had been a week or so since my last excursion. 

Clean up with a hot towel and gone.

On leaving that is when she said that she worked at QVB and that today was the first day here. She also said that if I come back and pay for BJ that DATY would be OK - still a bit steep $140 for an average looking woman and not FS. She seems very interested in earning extra dollars - I also asked if FS was on offer if I came back and she said no she doesn't do that.

So overall not a bad punt

I wandering past here the other day and decided to stick my head in the door. The signage 
out front is gone. Thought nothing of it so headed to the lifts and tried to get out on level 2, no
access. Wouldn't stop there got off on 3 and walked down the fire stairs and all doors locked.

So not sure but reckon this place is closed. Interesting that you can't get off on 2 via lifts. Wonder
if something dodgy was going on.

I went to check it out other day and got the same as curly above. I noticed a sign for a consulate for level 2 but either way, no access.

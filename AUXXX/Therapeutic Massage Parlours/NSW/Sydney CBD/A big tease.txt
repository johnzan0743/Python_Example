 A big tease
				
Post Content: 
A hole in the wall massage type place located in the arcade running under George st from Wynyard station - i think it is called Hunter arcade. The shop is opposite a coin shop & dining area fro a vietnamese restaurant.
Walking past i spied a hot little blonde - reminded me of a 20 year old version of Penny from Big Bang Theory. Really surprised me as these are usually the exclusive domain of asian massage girls.
Any way took the 45mins at $55.
The massage area is a tiny area split in 2 by a sheet (only about 6 feet high) that didn't even reach the end of the room. I could actually see the guys hair in the cubicle beside mine - fortunately he left soon after & no one else came during my visit. The cubicle was so small struggled to even get my clothes off. Not knowing what was potentially on offer i stripped down to my jocks & lay on the table. "Penny" came in wearing an incredibly tight & very short pair of denim shorts plus tight lycra singlet top. She used a peg to close the curtain to the arcade. 
Very noisy due to all the people walking by so they had a stereo on to deaden the background noise.
Anyway im lying down & she starts the massage. I immediately ask if i can remove my jocks. She says sure & actually helps remove them for me. Following was a pretty decent massage, heaps of upper inner thigh stuff with lots of accidental brushing of my bits. She then went & got a small towelette & placed over my arse before she then probed around my butt (external only). All the while i'm thinking the chances of extras are likely.

She then asks me to roll over. Happily she doesn't even bother with a towell to cover my bits - now fully at attention. Partly im thinking great but also counting on that peg & sheet holding fast otherwise passersby & restaurant diners will get an interesting view. She then oils me up all around my groin & goes to work, at one point standing behind my head & then leaning over me with her tank top housed boobs directly over my face as she runs hers hands right up to my pubic bone. I finally ask if she would do any extras - she says "no", just to be sure i then ask about a "happy ending ending" - again "no". But then she tells me she can recommend a different place up the road but not with her. She then even says i can take care of business myself once she leaves the cubicle & hysterically she even leant in & placed a box of tissues in the cubicle after she left.

As i said a pretty good massage but one hell of a tease.

Oh god, after that frustration you'd have to take care of it, or at least pop up the road to the other place straight away, and maybe skip the second massage.

Was she the only masseuse there?

Perhaps a regular may get lucky?

I've seen this girl a few times when I pass from hunter arcade to wynard station. She is hot. But I have read that this place doesn't offer extra so I haven't tried..

I think they are only open limited hours eg about 11am- 7pm Mon-Fri.

Forgot to mention in the review that the ceiling fan in the centre of the room has a highly reflective surface under it - means you can clearly see a reflection of the table in the adjoining cubicle. Thankfully the guy next to me finished & left before i lay down. Seeing some fat hairy arse (or worse) is not exactly what i want to see during a massage or for that matter having someone else be able to see mine isn't high on my agenda either.

There was one other lady on. She was as you would expect for this type of place - Thai & about 40 years old. That's why the blonde was such a stand out & had to tried out. 

As we all know it is YMMV so who knows?? particularly if you become a reg but i really doubt it. The cubicle has such minimal privacy, twice the other girl even came into my cubicle during my massage to grab something as they have nowhere to store anything - i think her handbag was even under my massage table.
The way she so quickly offered to recommend elsewhere also made me think no extras here. Plus the stars even lined up with there being noone in the cubicle next door. So i won't be trying again, way too much frustration. But as i said it was a pretty good massage but in a noisy location - maybe try after 2pm when there are heaps fewer people walking past. 

Obviously if you do try your luck be a gentleman about it, she seems a nice girl & lets face it, if you pissed her off & she charged out the cubicle with the sheet you'd be left in a pretty tough situation with no where to hide from potentially dozens of people only meters from you - who knows even Rhonda from HR might be walking past at that moment with you lying there with your flagpole at full mast. Sounds like a winning video for adult version of Funniest Home Videos.

I was having some noodles at the Vietnamese cafe the other week and noticed these two cauc chicks sitting out the front playing with their iphones. I thought that they were there waiting for some one or waiting their turn to get a massage. They looked like back packer types ie. young and hot looking! I dismissed the thought that they would be working there at that time....so I am gob smacked to hear that they are the masseuses!

By the way, when you are sitting at the cafe - it is like having front row seats at the boxing ring. You can literally see and hear everything!!

Haha...would take a game man to get more than a massage here

no sign of the blond recently ( i walk past this place to get my lunch)

There is a Cauc brunette girl there most days. looks mid thwenties and sort of spanish looking. No where near as cute as the blondes mentioned above but if you like the thrill of all teh action walking past could still be worth a punt.

Well I dropped by on Thursday to be greeted by an Asian woman probably late 30's early 40's and not bad looking. I was a bit disappointed (for the first time ever) that she was Asian and not some young backpacker/european hottie, so I opted for the 1/2 hr @ $40. She pointed me towards the left side of the shop and pulled the curtain back to reveal bed wedged into a very small space. I started to undress and noticed the shiny fan above (as rangerone mentioned before). So I lay face down and wait, then in walks this same Asian woman. Bugger I thought. Anyway I thought it may have been a bit more raunchy than it was, but she covered me with a towel straight away. 
It was all downhill from here....no massage, no brushing of the good bits, no effort to make it halfway enjoyable. Absolute rubbish. She wiped the oil off with a towel, says "finished", and pulled the curtain back and walked out. WOW
I won't be venturing back here, when you can go to dulwich hill for $5 more and have an hour of hot Thai young ness rub you up an down.

Thats a shame mate.

When i read you were greated by an Asian lady i must admit my first thoght was that they have brought in the ladies who would give a HJ to send punters off to a long weekend with a smile.

It seems not though.

This thread appears to be incorrectly located under Central West as the shop location appears to be near Wynyard Station.

Charles is definitely correct and I am pretty sure this place already has its own thread somewhere. It is a Tang shop in Hunter Arcade@ Wynyard. It has recently been renovated to upgrade the spaces. Check in CBD shops.

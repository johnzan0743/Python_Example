My experience/comments: feeling weary with2 hours clear in that part of town...decided to drop in on spec. It’s a bit Pokey, a bit noisy and rooms don’t go up to the ceiling. But decided to punt anyway....Palmy is sweet and pretty, but carrying a fair bit of weight.....stripped down and a nice massage followed…not hard enough for my likes....but more than adequate.....I did a bit of touching and she did a bit of responsive encouraging.

On the flip I had a whisper in my ear...this was followed by some bargaining and lots of sshh’s....she allowed a fair bit of touching and gave me an amazing HE....I think she only works on Tuesdays....but presume there are several other options at this place.

I will return.

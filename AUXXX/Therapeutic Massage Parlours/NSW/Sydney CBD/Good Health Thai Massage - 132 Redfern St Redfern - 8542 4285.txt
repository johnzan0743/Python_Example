My experience/comments : 

Just trying out new places. I thought this place was worth the visit given it's location to me and the flashing sign. Unforunately I think it's legit, the moment I walked into the massage room she was like "keep undies on". I doubt you'd get away with a sneaky here either as the music is too soft to block anything out. The massage itself was fantastic however, lots of use of her elbows and standing on my legs and feet etc to really get a good pressure point activation and stretch.

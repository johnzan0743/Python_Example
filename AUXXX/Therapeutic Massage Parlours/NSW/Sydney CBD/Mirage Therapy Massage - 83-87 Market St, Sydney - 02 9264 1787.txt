My experience/comments: Visiting from interstate and staying near by I saw this shop advertising massage.  It claims it is just opening and having a special.  Being from interstate I cannot confirm if this is true, however all I knew was that I wanted a massage and this was damn convenient for me right now.
Rates went from 15 mins up to the hour, I didn't have anything in mind except for a massage and so I figured $50 for 45mins was a good deal.
The massage itself was very relaxing, I'm normally into the deep tissue stuff and started to feel a bit disappointed but then relaxed and really managed to enjoy it.   
Things started looking up with the gentle strokes on the inside of the thigh and suddenly I was awake again.
After rolling over I was asked if I wanted to be massaged elsewhere with her gear off.  For $60 I figured what the hell.    It was a good massage and the ending was done well.
Only draw back was the oil and no shower facility that I could see.  The wet towels were ok, but oil sticks to me like shit to a blanket - so I was keen to hit the shower in the hotel asap.
I was sent on my was via another discreet exit up a lift.  
Bang for buck it was a good event, now I am keen to see what else Sydney has to offer when I am actually looking for fun.

Hey that is an interesting experience in that part of the city. The other day there was a Thai woman in Martin Place with a sign and handing out "special" prices on massage which I thought was pretty bold if they were not legit. I noticed the next day she was on corner of Pitt and Hunter so I grabbed a flyer. I did feel like a legit massage so went along to the place in O'Connell St where they have set up in a building with some occupation but mainly being renovated. It was completely legit and no funny business at all and a bloody good massage. She upsold me halfway to the 1 hour for $65 instead of the special $49 for 45 min. Great massage but totally legit. I think we will be seeing a lot more of this in the city and suburbs with basically unregistered cash businesses setting up temporarily and moving on - both legit and R&T.

I TOFTT and went in. The place *IS* new, with specials to try to get people in. There was no choice in ladies (I had no appointment) and I was allocated a 6' tall, very plain Chinese lady. The uniform here is a short skirt and conservative (short speed with high collar) top. My Plain Jane even had *UGG BOOTS* on. You just can't make this shit up!

Taking the $40 for 1/2 an hour option, I was queried if I had been there before. Sayin no, I was led to a nice room with a single-hole table and side table and chair. The unattractive WL told me "to take off clothes" and I played dumb as to underwear. She gestured "off!" and I obliged.

A very good massage followed. This place is able to service legit customers, although at the turn over the towel was left covering my genitals, there wasn't much respect on her part not to toch. It wasn't erotic, more "it is done as part of the leg massage."

And then... she motioned a wank and said "Twenty?" Aha. I wasn't feeling ANYTHING about her, or the experience - the massage was very good, so I declined. More massage followed until my time was up.

No showers are present, be warned. On my way out I saw a very cute, tiny Chinese masseuse, complete with short skirt, so things might look up for a return visit! At the very least a dent massage is available at a cheap rate!

 Mirage Therapy Massage 83-87 Market St Sydney

Mirage Therapy Massage 83-87 Market St Sydney Phone No 9264 1787
Date of Visit: 6 July 2011 Time of Visit: 4PM
I had some time to kill between appointments in the CBD. So I thought while not pay a visit to this place. This shop has been only been operating since about April 2011 and has not had a great number of reviews posted.

 From the outside this place looks legit, there is even a advertising board on the street with brochures. I picked up a brochure detailing the massage services. I went down the 20 or so stairs into the basement to the reception desk. The receptionist is Chinese milf. She asked me how long I wanted a massage for and what sort of massage would I like. The price for the "straight" massage is 30/45/60 minutes $40/$50/$60. However, the "special" massage price is 30/45/60 minutes $80/$100/$120. I opted to have a 30 minute "special" massage. What does the "special" massage encompass. Well it includes some "straight" massage and then at turnover time the masseuse disrobes, that is becomes nude and gives a hj (hand job)and concludes with more "straight" massage if any times remains. The pricing structure is simple and removes the "extras" negotiation haggle. I duly handed over $80 and the receptionist took me to a room and told me to undress.

The room had a massage table , portioning to the ceiling, a lockable door, a low table/shelf and a window with venetian blinds. I was not requested to shower either before or after the massage. I proceeded to undress and a soft knock on the door saw my massage lady, Georgina, enter. Georgina is a Chinese girl, aged somewhere between 20 to 25. She had short copper coloured hair, a pretty face and was about 160cm tall. Her body size is slim and as I found out later has A/B cup breast size and a untrimmed but cute china girl pussy. Georgina was dressed in a white nike two piece tennis outfit. All in all she looked the consummate sporting lady, and I was most happy to have her play with my bat and balls.

Georgina's English proficiency was reasonable. Accordingly I was able to establish that she, based on her advice, had been in Australia a number of years and had done her massage training here. Georgina asked what massage firmness I preferred and I opted for medium. Georgina then oiled up and proceeded to massage my body starting at the feet and working her way up. After the allotted passage of time Georgina requested me to turnover which I gladly did. At this point Georgina then disrobed, revealing a very nice tight bod as described above. She had lovely sexy white underwear beneath the nike sports uniform. Georgina also had a tattoo, about the size of an average male's palm, of a butterfly on the lower right of her stomach area. I got an inkling from talking with her that now she would prefer to be sans tattoo. She was able to tell me exactly how long ago she had been inked and was most dismissive of the tattoo. Maybe being inked has work/social/cultural impacts or a reminder of something bad/gone. Perhaps someone can me a heads up here.

Anyway I enquired as to what contact was allowable on my behalf. I established that I could touch/kiss her breasts and also rub her clit by hand but not insert finger(s) into her cunt. I did not ask about whether DATY or CBJ or BBBBJ were on offer. Given the touching boundaries outlined by Georgina I did not want to push matters. What was allowed was not unreasonable. So as I was not fully hard I took the opportunity to flick my tongue across and also suck her nipples for a minute or so. This resulted in me becoming quite stiff. Georgina then had me lie back down on the massage table and oiled her hands up. Georgina has good hand job skills and massaged my cock in a pleasing manner. I in the meantime had taken the opportunity to start rubbing her clit area, which Georgina seemed to like. Georgina tugged my cock with her right hand and played with my right nipple with her left hand. After a minute of middle leg massaging I blew my load. Georgina duly cleaned me up, then redressed, and went and got a hot towel. Georgina towelled my body down, thereby removing some to the scented massage oil. My personal preference is a shower. As there were five minutes left on the clock Georgina gave me a nice facial massage to finish off.

At time up Georgina departed and I redressed and exited the shop, into the busy pedestrian traffic that occurs in this area and headed off to my next appointment. In terms of whether I would return the answer is NO. Certainly the girl I had was quality but this has to be balanced off by what my hard earned purchased in services. In my opinion there is better value, in terms of time and extras on offer, to be had in the burbs, that is quantity of services. And I certainly prefer establishments that have a shower to enable deoiling following an oil body massage.

Hours of Business: 10 am until 8pm

Rates: $60 for 1 hr ($20 for a HJ and extra $30 for Nude)

Nationality or Ethnicity: Asian (chinese I think - eventhough the name is Japanese I believe)

Services Provided: Nude Massage and HJ 

Value for money/recommend?: Yes seems to compare with other places in the city.

My experience/comments: I arrived early about 1030am went downstairs to the reception desk....this was empty I waited a little while and then called out.  Suki came out and apologised, while ushering me to a room.  I was very impressed that they provided a complete throw away sheet that has a hole to place your face into that matches the massage table.   

The massage was Ok.  I then turned over and was asked about the extras.  I went with the nude HJ which as mentoned was $20 for the HJ and an extra $30 being nude (that was the ML being nude as I was already nude) (just in case someone asks the question).

She finished me off and cleaned up with tissues and a hot towel.   From my limited experince this was pretty well the norm.

Value for money/recommend? : yes

My experience/comments : I walked in with the intention of a legit massage but as soon as I saw the masseuse I knew resistance would be futile. I asked for the 15 min massage as I needed to do some shopping. Took me into a private room. Asked me if I had been there before. I lied and said yes. I asked if she did happy ending.  She said $20. Got straight down to business (no nudity offered but did let me rub her arse) but then had the female manager tell her another punter had arrived.  Finished me off and gave me a hot towel. I was left to let myself out and did the shopping. I was in there 10 mins total. Good value to relieve Christmas stress.

Persons name: sounded like Anka.
Mid 20's, slim, hardly a stunner but better than average looks.
Rate:$40 for 30 min + $30 for HJ (which she was quite firm on - the price that is ... although ...)
Date of visit: Friday June 22

Decided to check this place out today as was in CBD.  Fairly conspicuous entrance though has the look of a legit place.
Large underground space. Not sure how many rooms but full length partition walls.
Nearing the end, heard another customer arrive and although the voices were muffled, sounded like a female customer.

Took 30 min option.  Quite good firm massage which challenged the kinks in my back, and included some 'brushing' during leg massage and some brief tackle tickle before flip and asked if wanted HJ. Initially declined as not really in the mood but after some cajoling agreed to her request for $30. Technique was ok, would probably have appreciated it even more if in the mood, but got me over the line.
Followed by cleanup and more massage to fill out the time.

Will probably return but won't be in any hurry to do so.

 Mirage Therapy Massage - Kelly
				
Post Content: 
This was the first time I came to Mirage Therapy Massage and the place must have been busy, as the only girl available was Kelly, who just so happen to also be the receptionist. She seemed a bit like a MILF - must have been about 30-35.
I was a bit hesitant but decided what the hell as I need relief badly  Thus, I said yes and paid $60 for an hour. After getting in and getting undress down to my underwear I asked if any extras were on offer? She smiled and said yes. I asked her how much and she said $60 more for a Hand Job and being nude. I thought that was a pretty good deal and agreed to the terms. Soon after I paid her, she closed the door and started giving me a medium massage all over for the next 30 minutes. Must say for a receptionist she was pretty dam good, but discovered later that she also was a qualified masseuse  At about the 35 minute mark the phone rings outside and she says sorry but "I have to get this? " In my head I am think oh no and what a mood killer. But she is back in 2 minutes and apologies were given for the distraction, however as she was speaking the phone rings again and she run out again without say anything. 
I have a angry look on my face and she now insists that she is all mine now and that there will be no further distractions. I am not happy, but wanting to get on with it I cheekishly said "you better make it up to me" and with that, Kelly took off her top and she had the most beautiful tits (Size C); but with big nipples. They tasted very nice after I sucked on them hard and she loved it from her moans. I was letting my hands wonder all over, as she started play with my big fella. It did not take long for me to cum with a huge load that went all over her belly and hands. She was surprised how much cum was there and giggled and smiled. 
She finally cleaned me up (hot towels as no shower available) and gave me a nice neck message to end. Not a bad ending but would not go with a receptionist again...LOL

 Mirage Therapy Massage - Yumi
				
Post Content: 
Went back to Mirage after an ok punt last time with Kelly (MILF receptionist - please read previous post for more details), but thankfully was assigned to Yumi - a nice 22 year old Chinese girl.
Yumi has a great tight body and a great ass. She is also easy to speak to and has been in Sydney for about 2-3 years. She is currently studying at University for become a qualified Masseuse  As we were about to start I asked if she does any extras and she smiled and whispered in my ear that she will take care of me. With that she first start to give a great massage. I must say that her massage was one of the best I have ever had and her hands were like magic  My favorite part was when she got on top on my back and slowly started pressing her knees into my back...Cracking my stiff back several times. And no it was not painful at all as she was only 55 KG; it felt great and made my back feel so nice and relaxed. 
Soon about 30-40 minutes into the massage she got naked and good tackle play was also making my big fella stand at attention. I was enjoying my hands wondering all over her while she was doing the full body slides. As she slides back up the final time she begins to sucking on my ear lobes and whispers to me "is $100 more fair". With her gorgeous smile and cheeky laugh I said ok ($160 in Total - $100 for her an d $60 for the Mirage) and she begins to pull on me. We are kissing lightly and I begin sucking on a beautiful firm tits and my other two hands are firmly on her tight asssss  Soon we are in a 69 position and as I move my hands toward her pussy, she signals no and said no fingering. I smiled and said is it ok if I play with your clit. She blushingly said OK ....
So after a few minutes I ask her to turn around so I can suck on her tits again. They were so soft and beautiful that I start sucking them harder and harder. As this is happening she is slowing building my erection and with us both moaning I finally blew. 
Left with a big smile on my face and now reflecting back you could say it was a bit pricey for what I got, but was still very pleased. I would definitely recommend her if you like the petite Asian student type who is very playful and accommodating (As far as R&T places go).

 Mirage Therapy Massage - Suki
				
Post Content: 
Went back to Mirage after a great session with Yumi (read previous review for more information - a very nice 22 year old Chinese girl).
Anyway back to the girl for this review - Suki  She was the smallest and shortest girl I got at Mirage with a great body and a cute face. She was not the easiest girl to speak to and mostly responded with one or two word answers. Not sure if it was limited English or just her personality? She is currently studying at University and his just doing this to pay the bills.  She gave an ok-to-good massage, but no where near as good as the other girls there. My favorite part was when she gave extra attention to my butt-crack and ass. She must have spent a good 10 minutes there with good tackle tickle and brushing in just the right places for the grand finale. 
 Soon about 30-40 minutes into the massage she got naked and told me to turn over. I was hard from the moment I saw her and she had this cute grin on her face and started teasing with a little help caressing her body, her perfect natural A-B boobs and oh her great smooth asssss  Did not take much more to explode and at least end in a happy note.
Not the best, but left with a big smile on my face and hopefully a bit more talktivite on my next visit. Still gave a small tip which may have done the trick for next time as I got a big hug and a kiss

Hours of Business : 10am-9pm

Rates : $60/hr standard massage, +$30 HJ, +$100 HJ & B2B

Age : ~23

Size/shape : Thin-average, B cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, HJ, B2B

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, a little pricey but great service

My experience/comments : Went in for a "standard" massage for an hour. Signs everywhere saying "Do not ask staff for extra services of a sexual nature". Yuki is from Singapore but born in China apparently. She was wearing a short white professional looking dress that was fairly tight fitting.

Plenty of "mattress protectors" put down before the massage and stripped down to briefs. I wasn't sure of the rules but during the good back rub, my buttocks were seeming to get more than usual attention and no shyness about pressing her not body against me in the first half of the massage. She started on the legs and asked to remove the briefs to help her better do my legs and do a special leg stretch. 

Then I got the whisper in the ear about extra service, so opted for the full monty. She promptly stepped out of her dress to reveal black and white silk bra & pantie set. The bra was gone in seconds and she started massaging where it counts. She pressed her panties against my firm member and continued the massage. Then the panties were gone and she was sitting on top of me massaging me whilst asking me to massage her b-cup breasts. Understandably the session was coming to an end, and I finished happily.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, a little pricey but great service

My experience/comments : was in the area ad despite not seeing any recent reviews on this place thought i would try my hand. saw kelly who was a cute little thing with a great attitude. massage itself was average with only a small amount of TT. conversation through out was playful and despite the signs on the wall saying  no sexual service it was obvious that more was on offer. flip time came and Kelly asked straight up if i want HJ. negotiated $50 topless and what followed was an above average tug with plenty of effort from Kelly to at least appear like she was into it. Not the best place in town but if you are in the area its worth a pop in.

as i was walking out 2 ladies with arms full of shopping were wandering down the stairs. its always good to hide behind the cover of a legit massage when there are omen customers. Not sure what the ladies would have thought though as the ML's wear ting skirt uniforms similar to wishway which to me screams not legit.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided :R&T

Value for money/recommend? : $70 for 60 minutes. Great massage. 

My experience/comments : 


Lads popped in here on a Monday morning at about 11am. I had been to this joint about 6 months earlier and had seen Mandy. Could quite remember her name so l just asked to see all the girls. Remembered her face quickly. Booked her for one hour. 

The joint has a big space underground with a lot of rooms. All have mirrors in them and a shower is available in a separate bathroom. 

Little chit chat with Mandy. She gives a great massage. Knows how to use her elbows etc. No teasing or anything yet. Flip over with 30 minutes to go. My piece is at attention. Ask he about extras. Settle on $40 for two HE's. She gets going on round 1. Good technique by her. Little massaging on the chest and arms. 10 minutes to go and she starts with round two. Takes a little longer this time and we go about 5 minutes over. All good. Clean up and head out the door. 

Worth it? 

Good place for a good massage with a HE. Don't know about other extras with Mandy, but looking at a few of the others girls l would rate your chances. 

Cheers

Person's Name : Katie

Establishment : Mirage Therapy Massage

Date of Visit : 7 March 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Mirage massage - 9264 1787

Rates : 60mins / $70 for massage plus $20 for HJ.

Age : about 25 to 30

Size/shape : short, curvy, ever so slightly plump but her large rack more than makes up for that

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : This is a strange place. It is located directly across the road from David Jones. I am told that the ML's are all compelled to wear the same uniform, comprising a black sleeveless top, short black skirt with some kind of black shorts beneath. One for the retail fetishists, perhaps? I first met Katie at another place but see her here now because it is more convenient, although it costs $10 more. She is clearly well trained in massage. I know individual preferences can vary when it comes to massage, but I find she is one of the better ones. She doesn't have a strict routine, but this time she started with time on my neck and back, then moved down to one leg, then the other, covering the whole area from foot to waist. At 30 minute mark she washes the oil off and asks me to turn over. She then spends some time on the front of my legs, from foot to waist. This is something most ML's seem to leave out but I was quite grateful for it. This then transitioned seamlessly into the HE which was not rushed and included lots of teasing and handwork in the adjacent areas. Reached a very enjoyable conclusion and then the balance of the time was spent on head massage. Katie is a little shy and I don't think anything more than a HJ will be on offer, although I thought I had cracked it one time when she agreed to let me massage her. She then hopped on the table and lay down on her stomach with all of her clothes on. I pointed out that this wasn't what I had in mind but she wouldn't budge.

Date of Visit : October 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Mirage massage - 9264 1787

Rates : $70 for one hour massage, $20 for HJ, extra $30 for clothes off

Age : late 20s?

Size/shape : short and rather wide, to be honest - yes, curves but also just excessive weight/shape, although if that's your thing AND you enjoy D+ boobs, go for it!

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Value for money/recommend? : Not for me

As mentioned by others, Mirage is at the very top block of Market Street, across from David Jones and next to the Hermes store. Half of the block has some construction / development work going on, so it's covered in black boarding, which might make business a little slow for Mirage but also makes it rather stand out, because in the middle of all that black is all the Mirage signage!

It was one of those odd things where I'm rarely at this end of Market Street, but I found myself there three times in a single week, including two days back to back. First day I noticed Mirage, kept on walking, looked it up here when I got home and thought "Yeah, maybe next time..."

Two days later, I happen to be right there again, and weigh up going in but my timetable's working a little against me, so I let it pass.

The very next day, I find myself there again. Okay, this has to be a sign from the God of Rub'n'Tugs, so in I go.

Now I think it was Katie I was, based on earlier review – I could be mistaken. Anyway, nobody at the front desk, then out she trots, escorts me into a room. This place is a little of a rabbit warren and although the rooms are fairly decent size they'd also tight up against each other, at least mine was, so I could hear the punter in the next room if he talked a bit loudly.

As is often my practice at a new place, I opted for 45 minutes, the idea being I can leave it at that if the girl is so-so or extend to an hour, which the girls often take as a 'compliment' of sorts. Halfway through a quite decent and relaxing massage I decided to 'upgrade' to the full hour. Katie's massage is more relaxing then muscular/therapeutic, although still decent and not the useless long stroking of some massage girls.

She does my back, legs and shoulders, and during the leg work is okay for her hands to make slight hints at future fun in a very subtle way, which the average person may or may not pick up but we here know the score. I reciprocated by gently stroking her (slightly solid) legs with my hands a few times, so she knew that I knew too.

That communication and 'understanding' established, when it came time for me to turn over she went to work on my arms and chest and shoulders, really thorough – not the usual 'turn over and straight into play' routine, although the way Flyboy Jnr was pushing up against the towel and peeking out from it was also a clear signal of my interests. Katie also stood behind my head and leant down over my face in massaging my chest and stomach, knowing no doubt the effect that boobage in the face can have on a guy!

Off with the towel, and when she asked what extras I wanted, $50 upped the ante to off with her clothes as well. I should really have saved $30 of that and had her clothes left on, as her body size and shape was more effectively concealed under her clothing - it may have seemed amply curvaceous clothed, but sans clothing it just wasn't appealing.

None the less, I took time to enjoy her massive boobs, an attention which she enjoyed, and eventually she bought me off – she's quite talented in the Happy Ending Department, not at all rushed. But a session with her is not experience I'd rush to repeat.

I've been told by one of the ML's that it is permanent. Problems with the neighbours, apparently.

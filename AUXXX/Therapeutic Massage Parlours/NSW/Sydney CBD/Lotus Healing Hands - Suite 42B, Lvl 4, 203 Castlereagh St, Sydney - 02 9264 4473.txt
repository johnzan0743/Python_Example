My experience/comments : 
This place looks completely legitimate. Massage tables are separated by curtains only. But I thought it was worth an attempt - for the team.
Oil massage, "all clothes off please" - good sign so far.
Massage was very good, a bit of bum and tackle brushing - another good sign. Turn over time and time to make the move. Put her hand on the little guy and she asked me in a very soft whisper "Did I want the special?" $20 asked for and agreed. HJ pretty good and touching her now allowed - but fully clothed of course.
Paid her the $20, then went out and paid the rest of the massage. It is pretty clear that the "special" is not agreed to by the management - so be tactful.

Lotus Healing Hands
Level 4, 203 Castlereagh Street, Sydney CBD

I am always on the lookout for a new RnT shop, so when I saw the post by Blueballs I decided I need to investigate for myself.

How do you get there?
If you’re traveling by train get off at Town hall station as it is probably the closest, 2 blocks directly behind the Woolworths.  The building is right next door to a church and is very old and is mainly low cost office suites.  I suggest you take the lift to level 4 as the stairs are quite an effort (don't ask how i know this).
Level 4 is shared by some sort of dancing school, a church group, and the massage shop 
The shop is very open and not very discrete. 

What was the place like?
The shop seemed totally legitimate with a very low-cost set up.
The girls were sitting around the “reception area” doors and curtains wide open and some funky incense burning while they wait for clients.

Can you choose the girl?
Yes.
I asked for Kate specifically, but none of the girls knew who I was talking about, it looked to me that they must just make names up as they go and maybe forget to tell each other. The youngest looking one cheekily stood up and said I can be Kate if you want and led me to the massage cubicle.

Were there other girls there?
There were 4 girls there at the time to choose from, they all looked 30+ Thai 

What about the girl?
A reasonably pretty young Thai girl, said she was 21 years old, I don’t believe her as she looked closer to 30 with a bit of acne scarring on her cheeks.
Reasonably slim but fairly short and was heavily dressed for massage work and made it difficult for her to reach right over.  She seemed tired at the end of it.

What was her name?
Said her name was Angie, but I highly doubt it judging by the “Kate incident”.

What days does she work?
I asked her this question at the end, she said she works whatever days she can and didn’t have a set schedule. I wasn’t too keen to come back so didn’t inquire any further.

What was provided?
A top quality professional 1 hour dry massage ONLY (I hate when they drown you in oil) 
I politely offered Angie $20 tip for a HJ finish which she refused.
It seems she has principles and continuously avoided the soldier who was standing to attention.

Quality?
Massage was very good though I was disappointed that no extras were available. My muscles felt very relaxed at the end, but I did not feel relief. 

Price?
1 hour massage only session without oil was $50, (I think an oily massage was an extra $15) this is the basic pricing to most shops but no tug on offer regardless of tip, I would say it was too expensive.


Any extras available?
Unfortunately not, this girl made it quite clear nothing else was on the menu. 
Maybe another girl would be more obliging.

Would you go back?
Probably not, as I can get great relief at other shops from my standard $60-$70 punt.


I hope my fellow punters find this information useful.

I've visited this place for legit massages over the past 12 months. There's a couple of girls who offer HJ's but they're the minority (i haven't taken up their offer). The girls will typically rub the inside of your legs and brush your nuts if they're interested in extras.

ps: Kate also works Friday's from what I remember.

Person's Name : Taw

Establishment : Lotus Healing Hands

Date of Visit : May 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Level 4, 203 Castlereagh Street, Sydney CBD

Hours of Business : Not sure

Rates : $70/hr oil (+ $20 for HJ)

Age : mid 20's

Size/shape : Slim to average (for Thai)

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Very good oil massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : A lil expensive but enjoyable for the massage fans with a sneaky HJ

I've visited this shop a few times over the years and they generally give a decent Thai or oil massage. Most of the time it's strictly legit, but every now and again one of the girls offers a happy ending. Seeing the shop has curtain room dividers I usually refuse the HJ. The few times when I've accepted the ML seem to get worried if the HJ starts to make too much noise and the other customers can overhear.

I dropped in a few weeks ago on a Saturday and a cute 20 something Thai girl named Taw was working. She was there by herself, so the first thought that entered my mind was: 'I hope she offers a HJ' 

Taw gives a really good massage, lots of pressure and attention to my knots. She also worked the pressure points in my back and legs like a pro. 

During my leg massage is when things got interesting. Whilst working my upper legs she brushed into my balls, at first it was so gentle you could have been excused for thinking it was an accident. But after two or three times it was so obvious I knew what was coming next..... it basically reached the point where only my family jewels were being attended to  (remember no agreement for extra cash had taken place yet).

Once I flipped onto my back I asked what was on offer. $20 HJ, no nude or b2b. I took the $20 HJ and have to admit it was pretty good. After I came Taw cleaned me up with warm towels and gave a nice head massage.

Would I return? Yes, it was fun and overall a good massage.

Really cute girl with soft delicate hands. i had hight hopes, but her hands are well behaved. which is a pity as her touch is very slow and soothing. I didn't ask for HJ and i never do unless it's obvious. Mint never brushed or touch the jewels so i behaved accordingly.

Anyone had luck with Mint?

Date of Visit : 28 August 2013

Contact Details/Address : 0411 333 727 (off the supplied business card) / Level 4, 203 Castlereagh Street, Sydney

Hours of Business : 10:30 AM to 8:30 PM (according to the board at the street level door)

Rates : $69 1hr oil massage plus $30 HJ. The advertising board at the street level entrance indicates $49 1hr special but that is therapeutic.  Turns out it is $20 extra for oil.  This sign is upstairs inside the entrance area where I don't notice it on my way in. 

Age : 20s I guess

Size/shape : slim about size 6-7 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Yep, sure was

My experience/comments : I saw this place only had a small number of reviews so thought I would add to the group intel, as it turns out for once I made a good decision  

Located on the 4th floor of an older building.  There is a lift but the internal stairs are designed for everyday use and it is an easy climb to level 4.  Interestingly there appeared to be some form of security guard at the top of the stairs.  Male in street clothes just sitting there keeping an eye on the door.  he was there when I came out as well.

Went in and only one girl at desk - Sara who asked if I wanted a massage.  I wonder how often the answer is something other than "yes"   Sara asked what sort of massage I wanted and I asked for a 1 hr oil massage.  Sara took me through a door into a narrow corridor constructed from hanging cloth drapes with massage areas constructed from more hanging cloth drapes.  Team, this is not the place to be in the event of a fire!  We walked past 4 or 5 curtained cubicles and Sara showed me into the last one. She asked me to get undressed and pointed to the massage table.  Looking around I noted no tissues - bad.  Only a couple of coat hangers hooked on the flimsy curtains for your clothing that were so weak I had to put my clothes on the floor - good, surely legit places would do better than this.  No extra towels to cover you once you lie down - very good

Sara came back after a while and we negotiated a soft-medium all over body massage.  At this stage given the previous reviews I delayed asking about the tug part to see how the massage progressed.  Well, the massage progressed well beyond my expectations.  Right from the start is was a very sensual experience with gentle TT about 5 min in.  At this stage I rolled over slightly, looked at Sara, held my finger to my lips (there was a punter (male) and ML just starting next door) reached down for $30 I had left in plain sight on top of my clothes, put the cash in her hand and whispered "present".  Sara smiled and returned the silence gesture.  The remaining 50 odd minutes was bliss.  A very competent and sensual oil massage with lots of TT and an outstanding HJ from behind, half way through before the flip.  This was followed by an equally sensual massage over my entire front with a small towel strategically covering little Ant while I lay there in an extended state of post orgasmic bliss  .   

Sara used a lot of oil but went to a lot of trouble to clean me up with many hot towels and left several extra ones for me to use if I wanted before I got dressed. I did notice the oil seemed slightly scented and the hot wet towels did not remove it all of course so depending on where you are going afterwards a shower might be needed. 

Sara was a cute happy little thing and I will be very tempted to go back.  To me it was VFM, $100 for a very good 1hr RnT in the Sydney CBD ain't bad.

BTW, based on the noises emanating from the next door cubicle, I suspect that punter was also getting more than a basic massage

Rates : $65/hr oil massage

Age : mid 20s perhaps

Size/shape : Tiny slim size 5-6

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : Yes for the massage

My experience/comments : I was hoping for a repeat of my previous visit.  Alas not so.  I should have made a booking with Sara, but just rocked up cold as I was pressed for time, big mistake :mad2 .  Tanya was only ML available and showed me into one of the curtained cubicles and told me to get undressed.  Clothes off and onto the table.  Tanya returns and I repeat I would like a soft sensual massage.

Tanya starts of very nicely and after a couple of minutes is giving me long body strokes that pass deeply through my bum crack, in fact they were as deep as they could go, looking outstanding at this stage.  Tanya then starts to incorporate some groin strokes into the mix   and after a couple of minutes of this I look at her, hold my finger to my lips and offer her $30.  Tanya looks at me like i have 3 heads and doesn't understand, so i mime HJ to which she vigorously shakes her head.  Oh well at least I tried.  Surprisingly, the rest of the massage was everything but a HJ, lots of deep bum crack and groin action and some very slow inner thigh work with "accidental" brushing but with little ant half covered with a towel.

I summary, very nice if somewhat confusing massage..

Thanks for sharing brother and taken two for the team!

Sounds like a little hidden gem and HE is on offer but may be not from every ML and may be only when you became regular!

But it is frustrating if the part I and TT are sensual but you were left hanging !!

There are plenty of sure things in the CBD , I won't be taking any risk and the curtained cubicle is not my thing. For brothers who enjoy the thrills of adventure. God luck and enjoy!

Cheers

Went there weekday about 11 afew weeks ago. Was only customer and had ml called tow or something like that. $65 one hour oil. The manager sais change later from $100, I said ok. ML was quite cute looking but did a really great job. I asked for gentle massage and she teased lots. Turned over and she mimed hj then shh. Whoops I didn't keep the secret!! Asked for the $35 change I said why not. Great hj but didn't relly want to be touched much at all. Id go back mainly because it was fun and if you want somewhere looking super legit this is with only curtains between.

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Have been visiting this place regularly for the past yr for what I thought initially would only ever be straight massages.  Never really asked for specific girls.  Had seen Jessie a few times before this particular occassion.  Always get nude for the massage.  Always pay after the massage.  The first time I saw Jessie was an excellent legit straight massage.  Each time after that included ever increasing amounts of tickle tackle and hints at extras.  The time before this massage in particular was unbelievably sensual how much she was massaging my groin with the towel basically hanging off the table.  I never asked for hj tho as was always a bit shy funnily enough and its a very cramped place with 3 cubicles separated only by curtains. 

This time however, Jessie was feverishly massaging my groin so much that she clearly couldnt resist and just gave me a fantastic handjob even though there were other punters in the next cubicles.  The moment felt very intense, almost like the first time you have sex with your first girlfriend after waiting forever for her to be "ready!"  Jessie charged $20 for the HJ but just took it out my change.  Have seen her a couple of times since and have found out that in general it is a no HJ policy there but for regulars like me it is ok.  Some girls may be easier than other tho she says.  So armed with this knowledge my punts here have changed dramatically.

Similar pattern to that with Jessie.  Started off legit massage that developed over 3/4 visits into more and more groin and tickle tackle work and eventually she just gave me a HJ for $20 extra without me asking.  The only difference is that her hard massage is slightly better than jessies, but her HJ isnt as good by a small amount.  She is also much hotter than jessie.

Have seen Mint here on 3 occassions now.  She only works wednesdays.  But so far have got no more than straight massages with no hint of TT even.  She is a beautiful girl though, is very friendly and gives a great massage.  Will def keep trying with her but for now I'm smitten with the girl in my next review of this place.

Have seen this girl about 8 times now.  The first time was a busy monday evening for the massage shop.  She started the massage on my legs and started with the tickle tackle straight away.  and boy is she amazing at it.  On the turn she was basically including my balls in the massage as her whole hand was caressing them.  However, she didnt offer nor did I ask for HJ.  Boy did i wan myself furiously when I got home tho.  

Each time i visited her the same happened.  WHat I noticed about this place tho is that at the weekend particularly in the evening there is only one girl working there.  And Taw usually works saturday on her own.  So after about the 4th time I visited her a got no extras I started booking to see her on sunday evenings when it is nice and quiet with being the only punter there.  JACKPOT.  SHe went through the usual routine but this time I straight up asked her for HJ.  She acted a bit put off at first but she gave in pretty easily and gave me one of the top 3 handjobs Ive ever had.  She is literally brilliant at it.  Slow, smooth, sensual, absolutely brilliant.  And the technique she uses means I last for ages before cumming thus heightening the whole experience.  So Ive got about 4 hj massages from her now, all on a saturday evening, and each time Ive managed to get a bit further with her myself in terms of getting her ass out and playing with her pussy.  Never got her naked tho and for some reason she never lets me touch her boobs.  

Ill definitely keep going with this one to see precisely how much i get.  Even if it doesnt get better from here, her handjobs are worth it alone.

Tanya is a petite lovely thai woman. Her massage is legit. I've seen her three times and it has never gone erotic or of the sensual kind. She's not shy in massaging the ass, but i wouldn't go as far as calling it sensual, her hands only middy touched the jewels but it seemed non intentional. I have the feeling her and Mint are the 'behaved' girls at this place. I never push for HJ unless it's obvious. Sarah and Teaw are the ones for that.

I would recommend her highly for a strong massage. She is very strong and a lovely person to spend time with. She works Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays

Usually see Taw at this place, but thought i'd try one of the other girls for a change.

Rang and made booking with the only girl that works on a sunday, Apple.  Small, pretty and cute.  Lay down nude as usual.  Apple covered me with a towel and proceeded with a soft massage even though I asked for hard.  I think she just misheard me as I'm sure I had a very good hard massage from her a few years ago at the same shop.  I didn't tell her to change to hard though as her soft hands were so good!  When she was massaging my legs she massaged everywhere including every nook and cranny of my butt cheeks with plenty of ball and cock brushing.  Very sensual indeed.  On the flip, she positioned the towel so that it was only (barely) covering my package, and continued with the sensual strokes.  Asked if i wanted HJ...obvious answer.  Now after such a promising buildup the HJ wasn't great, but wasn't bad at all.  I exploded everywhere.  She has high competition at this place with Taw working there who provides an amazingly sensual experience that is akin to some of the massage videos on the hegre art website!

Age : Mid 20s

Size/shape : Quite petite.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes - for massage. Maybe a return visit worth it to see if more on offer.

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Had called up this place a few times to see if the mentioned Taw was on, but no luck. Had a free afternoon so decided to try it anyway.
Place is pretty discreet. There is a massage sign outside the doorway to the building and that's all. Took the stairs to the 4th floor and a few ladies are outside eating a meal.
One asked if I was after a massage and I agreed. 

Inside is a pretty standard setup with a "waiting room" - through another door is all the massage tables with dark lighting and curtains in between.
Sarah, quite petite and dress appropriately as a thai masseuse came in and asked me to undress.
1 hour of a very good, relaxing massage, hitting all the sore spots that I had, but not painful at all. I would definitely come back for the massage alone with her.
No hint of TT or any extras however, and on the flip was given a head massage and a short sit-up shoulder massage.
Finish up - get dressed and then head out to pay. 

I can't be sure if anything else was on offer - maybe its a time thing before they start to get comfortable with you. But a decent place for a massage and roll the dice.

Hi Chad, I haven't been to this place since my last review of Apple as I'm currently in the UK.  I just confirmed with Taw however that she works Mon-wed, fri and sat.  The best time to see her is usually on a Saturday as she has the shop to herself then.

Also, I have been going to this shop regularly for the past 4 years.  For the first few years I rotated around the various girls working there but have mainly been using Taw exclusively for the past few years.  Most of the girls do extras, but not sure how many do on your first visit with them, although I know Taw would.  

However I would highly recommend seeing Taw regularly as she you will go from a simple but excellent HJ on your first visit to a mind blowing sensual experience the more you see her!

I'm giving a plug for the best sensual Thai masseuse in Sydney, the lovely Taw. I am a fan of Taw as she is the kind of woman where patience can reward you. Don't get me wrong, she never does FS, BJ or even nude, but... somethings are possible from her. She will give you a professional oil massage with her hands always gliding sensually over your back, legs and ass. The more you see her, the more the massage is just pure sensual with non stop balls and asshole play with an slow and teasing build up. A true gem. She works Mondays, Fridays and Saturday.

The website Sabai Thai Massage doesn't mention Glebe. I thought Sabai was a generic name - are they separate businesses?
It's a two-story establishment, curtains on the cubicles. They do the genuine thai massage (clothed) on ground floor, and the neck shoulder and back massages on 1st floor.  Not sure where they do the oil massages. 
I've been to the Oxford st joint many times for a good-great legitimate massage. A few times wondered why other customers would ask for certain people & had a friend complain about "sexual harassment" from one of the masseurs after a naked oil massage.  Once I pulled my pants down a bit too far (normally pull them down enough they can reach the bottom of my spine for a back massage) and the masseur pulled them back up when she came in - quite obvious nothing was going to happen. 

However it all changed after I got a loyalty card.  A few massages in and I got a few accidental tackle brushes. Enjoyed it, they must have noted it, next visit I was raising a tent and next thing masseur was naked, removing my clothes I got a BBBJ and anal.  [Removed unsubstantiated claim. BAB]

In my experiences the women have given me legit massages, the boys give me the extras.
They write the name on the loyalty card when you leave, I thought that was a hint as to the type of massage, but had a bbbj without the card.

Hi bi_the_lake

Just wondering how you got full service when there is only curtains separating the rooms...  Have they done an upgrade or do they have private rooms some

where?

i went here on Sunday. (first time in about 6 months). Many girls had changed as i asked for 'Jane' and a much younger petite shy girl appeared compared to the older chubby lady i previously saw by the same name. anyway.... i find it very hard to believe what bi_the_lake has stated. sheer curtains upstairs and down stairs the curtains (none sheer) don't close off completely. Are you talking about Silk Thai Massage next door? I only ever see men enter that one...

My massage was by the book and as per previous experiences. very good but legit. The new Jane is a lovely shy girl just arrived from Chiang Rai. Limited english, soft hands, and a true sweet thai gem.

Basially some massuers' hands wander.  As mentioned on the other Sabbai thread, everything is very hush-hush, they'll cover up if they hear somebody coming. 
Basically if they've made a few "accidental brushes" they might ask if you want "more time". If you agree, you're likely to get something.  Another time it was simply wandering hands.  But everytime footsteps came past it was back to business as usual. 

I think it depends on who you get, and in my experience it's rare on the first visit.  Also please note I said all the females gave me non-sexual massages, it was only the boys that ventured further (this is oxford st, after all)

I was wondering if they simply find me irresistible?  I'd be interested to know. Or maybe this thread should actually be under the "walk on the wild side" category?

Hi All

I believe Sabai Thai Massage has changed owners and its the same owners as the M2M massage further up Oxford St.  I think its called 3 boys thai?

Anyway, I would suggest all will be on the menu soon!

Overtheedge: interesting. i thought that as now they ask for payment before the massage which never happened when i visited early in the year.

However, i'm finding the service to be the same. Some of the older ladies here have the art of teasing down to a fine art.

When i arrived at Sabai, there were only Men available.  I went for a bite to eat and ventured up the road and saw the same owners who were in Sabai Thai walking out of 3 boys thai.

One of the men in Sabai mentioned "new" boss when i was in there.

I have no doubt that the same service will be on offer soon.

Wtf?! I got a living social massage at this place as it was cheap and had no idea it was a gay massage place.  I was wondering why I got a male masseuse. I wouldn't have gone if I had known.  The massage was awful. The bloke had no idea how to give a Thai massage.

Actually what you got was a masseur.   Male = masseur; female = masseuse.

I love this place for proper massage but suggest you ask for a female massage. I've never had anything sexual with a lady but recently I had a man and he really lingered on the front part of the massage which made me very uncomfortable a few attempt at cock brushes and like that but I just ignored it because was too embarrassed to tell him no! He didn't offer any extra in the end

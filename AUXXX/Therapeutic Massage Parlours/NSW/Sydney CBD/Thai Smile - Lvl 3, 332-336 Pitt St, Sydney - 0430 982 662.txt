Another new Thai massage in the city on 332-336 Pitt Street Level 3 Fortuna House 0430982662
It was 4pm in the arvo, I had two hours to kill before a dinner appointment and was looking for the Korean massage 100m down the road. Some young Thai boy in the street handed me a pamphlet which advertise the new place and I thought it would be better to check it out.
Went up the lift and found the massage place next door to a Japanese language school.
There were two nice young looking Thai girls waiting and the prettiest fair skin one greeted me and invited me inside. 
I though it was my lucky day but when I saw the inside I knew definitely that there would not be any extra services. There is only one massage area divided into 8 cubicles separated by curtains. Let off any gas and you will poison everyone.
I took the Special Oil massage $75/hr (Thai Oil massage $65/hr, Thai massage $49/hr, neck & shoulder $20/15min). It was wonderful restful massage. Nearly fell asleep since it was so relaxing.
When it finished I was offered a hot tea or water.
For all you city office workers I recommend this place to get a break and nice massage.

I've said it before and I'll say it again.

Asian massage joints, which are located along the 'dodgy end' of Pitt or George or Sussex or whatever streets, and which are upstairs at that, and have names that are either alluring ('smile') or overloaded with generics ('Chinese Healthy Remedial Relaxing Massage Palace'), and employ cute young girls, should NOT be allowed to be strictly legit massage-only.

It's just false advertising to have an Asian 'Happy Glow Massage Center' on the 2nd floor of 620 George Street open to 10pm employing cute young Asian things which only does massage and nothing more.

There should be a law against it. Any place which has ticks three or more of the above boxes – or other traits such as being open late in the evening – should be required by law to offer a happy ending!

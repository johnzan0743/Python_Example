This place is an institution.

It is a hole in the wall offering cheap r&t's under a legitimate remedial massage centre.

The massages start from $ 35 for half, with an additional $ 20 for a HJ.  The woman are fully clothed.  To get them nude, you need to pay extra.

It has been some time since i visited this place.  The rooms are small, there is no showers, they wash your dick with a wet rag!!!!  Quite frankly, there is better looking woman at cheaper prices elsewhere.

With a rock solid cock and half an hour to kill, i  ventured in.  Waiting was Michelle.

Michelle is 24, Chinese and wouldnt be out of place in the movie "Revenge of the Nerds".  She wore thick glasses, hair parted to one side held in by a clip, a blouse, mid length jeans and the best fashion feature was her white socks and sandals.  Underneath her high end fashion was a pretty young girl.

There was something about this girl that drove me wild.  I am not sure if it was she was so innocent looking or the fact that i needed to clear the pipes desperately.

The legitimate massage started and was quite good.  She walked up and down my spine letting all the cracks out.  When i rolled over, she started talking dirty.... It got me excited and after a few minutes of fast wanking i shot my load.  "You cum lot"  "Make me horny" said Michelle as my cum hit the ceilings.

All in all it was just another way to shoot a load.  The value is better at Thai Oasis around the corner.

I also had pleasant, if not identical, experience with Lucy recently. Backstepping was very professional, and all round a fine experience.  I thought she may have been older than 35 but trim and well presented.  I like the fully enclosed rooms.

Establishment: Brisbane Street Massage, 2 Brisbane Street, Surry Hills, 02 9269 0756

Person's Name: Julie

Hours of Business: 10am - 8pm

Prices: 30/45/60 ($35/$50/$60)

Age: 40s

Size/shape: Short / Slender Built

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Remedial Massage with optional Happy Ending

Value for money/recommend?: Yes

I walked past this place a number of times on the way to Oasis in Surry Hills. It is just of Oxford Street between Oxford and Poplar Street (where Oasis is). The other day I decided to go in and have a look. Inside it is much like any Chinese Massage place. Little fountain thingey in the corner. A curtain on the side covering a little room with a telly and soon enough a little lady appears from there to ask 'massage?' Yes, please. We wonder off in a little room on the other side and it is freezing in there. I almost decide to come back another day but she quickly gets why I'm shivering so much and puts the heater on. Thanks love.

Julie is a 40-ish MILF and her massage skills are pretty good. Good hard massage and at one point I thought she was gonna rip my head of, as everything inside seemed to crack/snap at once. She has those metal railings on the top and she uses her feet a lot during the massage.

She told me that a younger girl works later during the day as she studies in the mornings and it is generally not busy in the mornings. I was there around noon and no one else to be seen.

Another thing I noticed was the poster on the wall. It's a picture (painting) of a nude girl with the naughty bits covered with roses and petals while her hand disappears below the petals, so she is obviously pleasuring herself. Nice touch!

I am sure there is more on offer here, but because of the insisting cold 'little A' decided to stay home today but for an extra $20 a HJ is defintely on the cards.

Massage    8/10 (very good)
Lady       4/10 (to old for me but might be nice enough for some and quite chatty) 
Place      6/10 (clean enough but messy, stuff everywhere)
HJ         0/10 (didn't try)

2 Brisbane Street, Surry Hills, 02 9269 0756
With Mrs SeaRay unwell in Hospital, I was as randy as a cut snake and my scrotum was stretching to the limits with a M.S.B.... after reading about the $95 Day from   ? I need a release and buzzed towards Ashfield who have an Asian mixture of women for $100 or I could have if I had time go to Billy's or Red Sunset @ Marrickville but Sydney's traffic in the inner west was at a standstill and time was running out so Stupid here went to Brisbane Street with only the intention of a RnT.... There are 2 dangerous things when driving a car a) talking on a mobile phone when driving b) making the wrong choice when you have a pocket of cash & a M.S.B.
Now for you younger chaps a M.S.B. is a massive sperm build up and for us old Sea Dogs it used to stand for the Maritime Services Board.... now it has been many years since I once stuck my noise into this dingy joint which did smell of wet washing & Asian cooking so for the purpose of a quick rub & wank I thought this joint will do... Parking was easy straight out the front and upon entering a slim slutty looking mid 30's M.L.C. called I think her name was Micky who was be her self showed me to a room with walls to the roof but that didn't matter as she left the door ajar anyway and I paid her $60 for an hour which was the first big mistake as I was really pushing for time. five minutes into the massage she was tickling the sack which she most likely could see was full of juice and I did mention Mrs Ray was not well and she asked if I would like B2B and asked how much would I pay, well I had given the bitch $60 and I only had $50 notes so I said $40 and you give me $10 back which didn't happen. Upon paying the $50 she stripped and revealed a nice little Chinese body with nice looking titties in which I sucked her nips but when I tried to do any thing else she moved away although the massage & B2B was hopeless I got her to hop up on the table and stick her cunt into my face whilst wanking me off which only took a minute as I was so full of juice and you guessed it as soon as I blow she did the quick clean up and dressed. This is where I got the shits, after paying her $110 I said to her she can finish the hours massage in the nude and I was so upset I dressed and left with more than 45 minutes left making her know of my displeasure in which she didn't offer any refund then again I was so pissed off I just wanted to get out of there. Stupid me should have used the brain and visited the First Mate in the Hospital, spoken to the Doctor and eat 1/2 her Dinner then gone rooting but a man with M.S.B. does do stupid things !

Thanks Searay. I'm surprised this place is still going. This is a far cry from the how it used to be with the first two owners Tina and then Eva. Sounds like one to avoid at the moment.

Tina used to give a slow unrushed hj that lasted half an hour. Those were the days.....

After this you turn over and she finishes you with a good hj.All over in 10 minutes ,whats funny she keeps her eyes closed whilst doing the hj.She stays clothed as well.

Size/shape : Medium build, A-B Cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese 

Services Provided : Massage + HJ (nude)

Value for money/recommend? : Ok ish

My experience/comments :

I was a customer of this shop when the original and very skilful Tina was the Boss. Tina is now long gone back to China and the place has changed hands a few times. I had thought this place had shut down at one point, and seeing the recent reviews reminded me otherwise. So in search of a simple lunch time quickie I fronted up and a reasonably attractive milf Wendy greeted me and showed me to the room. For those that don't know this shop it is a small place- two massage rooms that are nice and private with walls that go up to the ceiling. 

Initially everything was fine, Wendy was very friendly and the massage was not bad (went for the half hour option). Unusually no tackle just prior to turn over however once I turned Wendy popped the usual question. I nodded yes and then she offered clothes off. I ask how much and she says $50. I countered with $40 (after all she asked not me) but she was insistent on $50. I'm thinking gees sweetie I don't want to see you naked that badly so I say just the HJ then no nude. She wasn't keen on that either and kept on about $50 but I wasn't about to give in either. Eventually she gave in but the whole thing put a bit of a downer on the experience. Not keen on this trend among the Chinese girls of pushing for the nude tip at the end- I'd much prefer to do the asking.

Anyway she relented and the HJ was fast paced from the outset. Good job I was horny and didn't have any trouble finishing. Overall average I'd say. On the way out I saw the mamasan and the other girl on duty who looked cute. So not giving up on this shop just yet however may be looking to try a different girl next time.

My experience/comments : well saw lucy yesterday. great massage... she tried to work on my back in a part that I had a lot of tension... she felt like she knew what she was doing.. I actually took an hour after initially requesting half due to the massage being so good...I did leave a little miffed that it was more like a 45 min massage as a lot of places seem to try and get away with IMO..
After working thoroughly on my back she briefly did the legs.. then she moved to the tug.. great tug.. she really knew how to handle it... same method as others have described... your legs over hers and she did some great TT...

all in all I left happy but would like to get an hour if an hour has been paid for. thats my only gripe but great massage and great tug...
Ill go back in the future

Services Provided : rub and tug

Value for money/recommend? : bad massage good tug...50/50

My experience/comments : popped in here the other day as I wasnt keen on going too far from home...This place can be hit and miss but took the chance...

Opted for the 30 minute massage... lets just say there isnt much that can be written about the massage... it was light poking and prodding lasted about 10 minutes all in all it was rubbish... we then we negotiated the tug or nude and I just took the tug... she tried a few times to up sell me but I wasnt interested in seeing her naked for a pineapple so paid the 20 and she went in to quite a good HJ... pleasantly surprised... didnt try to rush and really had a great technique... I was horny so blew after a couple of minutes...she cleaned me up and then the kicker was a great head massage... lasted about 5 minutes and was really relaxing


So in summary grace gives a shit body massage, quite a good tug and quite a good head massage..

I would actually go back and pay for a head massage and tug... skip the body massage...

she also works Thurs Frid...

My experience/comments : 

Been a while since I was here got given Grace who is in her 50's from China. Grace is the sought of girl that gives the minimal service as required but try's to get the upgrades happening fast.

After handing over a $50.00 note for 1/2 hours she replies "what about handjob,you need a extra $5.00 ,so I take back the $50.00 note and give her a $100.00 note ,she replies "you want nude as well ?, that will be $85.00 ".
 I said fine, as soon as she finished the massage which was only OK, she gave me a couple of minutes of tackle and tease,i turned over and she was trying to make me cum straight away i made her slow down and she positions but she was keeping her safety distance.

overall 6/10.........wont see her again.  Lucy is the best here

Apple is mid 30's Good looking The massage was decent (I have been spoilt though having over 1000 massages worldwide) She has a great body which I paid extra for her to strip ($50.00 includes HJ) Has a nice little bubble bum ,nice small firm breasts and is a little street smart .Asked to DATY and she said $200.00   LOL no thanks ,the HJ was just acceptable her hand technique was off the mark with her massaging too much at the bottom not the head of the Knob.

I know to stick to Lucy only here from now on..

With so many RNT'S in sydney the talent is way too thin and spread out now.

Services: Nude RnT 
Value for money/recommend?: Yes 
My experience/comments:

This was the first time that I had seen Julie, although she tells me that she has been working at this establishment for quite a long time.

Looking back at the reviews I could see that she is been mentioned once or twice, so I'm not so sure why I've missed her.

I asked for hard and and that is what I got, the walking was first up although I would describe it more as tap dancing and walking. I was seriously concerned when she jumped on my neck that my head will pop off, luckily it didn't, not sure that I experienced any real remedial advantage from this approach.

Julie is an older lady with a body that is in pretty reasonable condition but certainly not in its prime. Very happy to get nude, access all areas, not shaven, very little pubic hair.

So would I return, probably, but again she had an enterprising error about her and I got the feeling that any requests would quickly be met with a fiscal proposition, so probably won't be rushing to get back there is there are probably better options within the same price frame.

I don't know which day she works but she was there on the Saturday, so maybe someone else who hurts visitor can update us.

Hey guys, long time member who took a long break but i guess its time to come back and share some reviews.

As far as i know, this place already has a thread in the massage forum so if this is good enough you can merge it.

Person's Name : Julie/Julia

Establishment : 2 Brisbane St, Darlinghurst

Date of Visit : Late Jan

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 9269 0756

Hours of Business : Monday to Sat. Not sure when it opens but closes around 6:30.

Rates : I did half hour for 35 + extras

Age : Late 30's to early 40's

Size/shape : MILF type with a nice body

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage with HR

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Was passing through and tempted to go to Jasmines on Poplar St but i had seen this sign in Brisbane St for a while and thought i would give it a shot. Was greeted by Julia/Julie who was nice and friendly and went for the half hour option. 
Julie is a MILF who would have looked really hot in her day and provided a nice massage. She even got on my back and did some stepping which felt really nice.

After a bit more massage, the hard presses began to get a bit softer and the "accidental" touches began. After a fewlight strokes, i was asked to turn around where a bit more of a soft massage was given before i was asked if i wanted my hard friend relieved. $20 for HR which i eagerly accepted and off we went! I lay back and relaxed as she did her thing and after i came she cleaned me up and we made a bit of small chat before i walked out th door.

Overall a pleasant experience and i didnt push for more extra's as it was my first experience there (although it wont be my last!)

Said goodbyes and left a happy chappy. More to come

How;'s this for a 2 in 1!!

After my experience with Julie/Julia i decided to come back and try my luck again. I'm gonna post a review, but this review is basically 2 reviews in 1 as i will be combining my next 2 experiences into 1 review with the same woman. First was the Thursday before Australia Day and the second was the next week after that.

The woman's name is Lin (Lynn?) and both experiences were the same, although the second experience we had a bit more chit chat as she recognized me from the week before  



Person's Name : Lin

Establishment : 2 Brisbane St

Date of Visit : 25th Jan (The day before Aussie Day long weekend) then again approx 2 weeks later on 7th Feb. As mentioned before, both experiences were about the same with the second one a bit more "friendly" as she recognized me from the previous fortnight.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As Above

Hours of Business : Mon-Sat, not sure when they open but they close roughly 6:30

Rates : i went for the half hour $35 option.

Age : Late 30's to early to mid 40's

Size/shape : Slim MILF 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage with HR

Value for money/recommend? : For this occasion yes.

My experience/comments : Dropped in and was greeted by Lin. Lin is Chinese and has pretty good English. Stripped down and she began to give me a nice massage as i relaxed and tried to block out the world for half an hour 
A bit of small chat as she massaged me. As this was the day before Aussie Day i asked what she was doing and she told me what plans she had on the Friday (Aussie Day) as i told her mine. I won't get into details of her plans but the massage was nice and relaxing for what it was. Time to turn over and was offered HR for the standard $20. I lay back and relaxed as she oiled up and gave me possibly one of the best handjobs i ever received. Without being rude, i told her how i liked it and she was happy to comply. When it was time to shoot, i completely exploded and she slowly eased off, giving me time to come back to earth. Once i was back to reality i took my time to get dressed after she cleaned me up as we made a bit more small talk. Got dressed and left a happy chappy.

About 2 weeks later i returned and was greeted by her again! She recognized me and the massage was pretty much a repeat of the first one, except this time we chatted a bit more and she was more open and friendly. A few lame jokes got her giggling as she gave me a nice relaxing massage. Her hands slowly wandered to the slow teasing phase until it was time to turn over as she continued to  tease me some more. Of course, i opted to release the pressure buildup and once again Lin gave me what i considered the perfect handjob which made me have to catch my breath once i finished releasing my load. After catching my breath, i got changed and once again made some friendly small talk as i left once again a satisfied customer.

I did not push for any extras as i decided to take the respectful approach with these ladies as they provide an excellent service and are very nice to me. Not sure if they offer anything else as i did not ask, but please if you DO go see these ladies please be respectful as they were very nice and respectful to me and seemed genuinely nice and friendly as they massaged me.

Thought about keeping this place to myself but i guess i might be making a few more reviews about this place in the next few weeks

I've been to Babylon a few times and samples #888 and #123. #888 was ok but didn't talk much, just your average R'n'T. #123 was much better with some talk and a wicked CBJ. 

But my view of the place was lifted sky-fricken-high when I chose #200. 

Usually it's the obligatory massage to start things off, lights down half way through, body slide, rub, tug and finish. 

#200 had other ideas -- in fact I wondered if she thought I was just there for a quick 15min, 30 min at the most!

I lay down on the table, face down, and the first thing I feel are a gorgeous set of breasts being rubbed against my legs and back. Oh, I should mention, when I got into the room she was in a school girl outfit -- superb. 

Unusual, I think to myself, this is usually reserved for the better and latter half of the massage. 

She continues a wonderful body slide and then it can't be more than 7 minutes into it and she asks me to turn over. She jumps on top, places her pussy in my face and proceed with a epic BBBJ. I muster the compus mentis to ask her if I may eat and she giggle with agreement. The taste was superb and she didn't mind a bit of rimming too. I'm usually not into that, but I couldn't resist. 

The BBBJ gave way to a bit of 'almost cowgirl' sliding with her on top. I asked if she did full service, but as is the norm at Babylon this was not on offer. That there is the *only* disappointment about this session. With some more sliding I came and the massage followed. 

The massage was nice and relaxing. 

But wait............ what's this?........ Does she want me to kiss her? .. yes, she does. DFK it is and I'm hard again. 

A second BBBJ follows til i cum with a quick switch to handwork to avoid the baby batter in her mouth. 

Incredible. 

A little more massage and then my time is up............ back up to the showers for a long hot shower under those excellent huge shower heads. 

#200 -- Superb.

I have been a regular at Babylon for almost 9 years. For the first 6 years I went there exclusivley for the sauna and chill-out. I was not a punter at that time and though I realised fairly early on that it was a shop they eventually realised that I was there for the sauna. I have lived in countries were sauna is a serious part of your week and so for those of you who love a good sauna (dry or wet), spa and a chill out then for $28 you can broil yourself like a lobster for 3 hours. The manager uses the sauna himself and so it is whistle clean. The dry sauna is on a 2 hour cycle and gets up to the plus 100 C mark which makes is hot enough to be useful. I have been in saunas where 110 C is the "norm" and so I have a high tolerance and searched Sydney for years looking for a good hot sauna.

The staff are unfailingly polite and helpful. There is a chillout room where you can fall asleep, get a cup of tea and/or watch TV. This place is dleightful in the daytime and late afternoon. I avoid it after 10pm, especially on Friday night and the weekend when it can become very rowdy. You can get a proper traditional chinese massage for $100, foot massage for $60.

In the happy ending department the Korean girls do massage with CBJ (unless you get lucky and score BBBJ) for $178. I have not seen any of the Korean girls for almost 3 years but I when I did see them the massage part averaged from being bloody awful to bloody amazing. They used to get genuine students and some of them were great but now it seems to be all sourced from a mamasan in Korea and the girls are experienced. I never got offered FS from anyone, CBJ seems to be the norm now but I do hear things in the locker room of BBBJ. I have no idea who does it.

The Chinese girls do happy ending - clothes on for $138 and clothes off for $178. Generally speaking the Chinese girls are much more consistent with the quality of their massage. I like to chat and have a good time as much as anything else and when I meet a girl I like and "connect with" then I tend to lock in with her and become her regular. There really is nothing worse than a bad punt. 

For this reason, I have seen #22 for ages. She speaks very good english, has lovely silky white skin, gorgeous full, C-D all natural breasts and terrific legs. She is full of wit and charm and a total delight to spend the hour with. She is also nobody''s fool. Give her any shit and she will never see you again and that goes for all of the Chinese girls. Again, FS is not on the menu. There is a sign on the door that says so. Ask once and you will be politley refused. Push the point and the girl will probably end the session and you will find yourself assisted in leaving. I have seen that a few times. And I don't get it really. It is $178 for a massage and happy ending. If I want FS then I know 10 shops within 10 minutes walk where you will DEFINITELY get laid for $160. So why would you bother with the hassle?

Also you can get free parking in Market City after 5pm if you use the shops in the centre. So park underneath when you go to Babylon and get them to stamp your ticket on the way out.

 Babylong (Market City) : #200
				
Post Content: 
Visited on a weekend approx 4pm.
Had the usual shower and went to the lounge area. The hostess showed me 4 ladies, usual air brushed type pics , I simply asked her to recommend one (sometimes they tell the gals to make it good as the host recommended). She recommended #200.

Stated she was 24 and looked it. Nice perky athletic body and fairly short (5ft 3 max). standard massge at the start was not too bad..but the erotic massage was great.

a couple of times the gals here just go thru the motions, but this gal seemed like she enjoyed playing "wandering hands" and getting my body into all sorts of positions as she grabbed me. at one stage when i was getting a CBJ i would have been millimetres from a 69, but she shoved her hips up and got herself off on my upper chest..not that im to mind 

after that she proceeded with a lil head massage and saw me out the door.
all in all a solid effort. ive been here a few times and CBJ seems to be hit or miss..this time i got it so it makes for a good service. cute atheltic type of gal whose english was above normal.

How long is a $178 massage? 
I went about 4 years ago saw a stunning sexy small Korean for an hour and it set me back the price of a high end FS ($260-280? ).
 It was an incredible mix of therapeutic and erotic. plenty of BBBJ.
During 69 she pushed so hard into my face she nearly smoothed me. I  had to physically lift her off me to extract my nose from within her pussy. There was an actual moment of OMG I can't breathe, and any sounds I attempted to make just made the situation worse! Then the solution occurred to me, I gently pushed her up by the hips.  To this day I still remember looking up at the pussy that tried to kill me, as I panted for breathe I was blowing air straight at her pussy, to which she wiggled with delight in my hands.
I have never returned for fear of a $280 habit.

New meaning to the term safe sex, being strong enough to lift her off you face in the advent of being smothered by her pussy.

I found this place to be superior to Jasmin's in Surry Hills even though they provide a bbj there.

However, if you compare this place to Oriana/Vitamin in Help Street Chatswood it comes out a poor second.

My experience/comments:
First time visiting Babylon. Visited ~10pm in the evening. 

They have a very nice spa/sauna/steam area to relax before going through to the lounge, where you can read, watch some TV, have a few drinks.

I was offered a Chinese girl, young student who had been there for a couple of weeks. Started off with a nice massage, back massage for about 10 min, followed by a oil/cream massage, before she went on to body slide with hot oils, then onto the fun stuff - bit of rnt, CBJ, unfortunately no cum in mouth, but would definitely visit her again.

Great location in Market City, convenient to the city. They will also validate parking for customers which is even better.

Does anyone know if #200 is still working there and if so, what days?
Babylon was my first ever RnT.  At first I just thought it was a regular massage place and then I enquired about the difference between the massages and soon learned the truth.  However having been to various other places I have to say Babylon is very pricey, especially as you don't always get to pick the girl.  I suppose you are paying for the spa etc, but I usually just want to be in and out.  However if #200 is as good as described here, I may return.

Babylon Spa - Market City Haymarket


Nice place.  Big spa area if you want the full relaxation experience.  Great showers.  Seems to double as a legitimate massage joint and I have seen women guests there too, although largely just men.  Something got lost in translation once and I accidentally had a normal chinese massage which was far from erotic - it bloody hurt!


You are led into a nice relaxation lounge where many people wait.  No hiding behind curtains here.  Nice place to get a foot massage before the main event.  There seem to be two different types of erotic massage here.  The Korean massage, which is nude body to body with CBJ and HJ.  This costs around $180 which I recall was for an hour (no 45 or 30 min option).  You do get to choose the girl from a photo book, although I have never felt the pictures are a good likeness and I have even wondered whether I actually end up with the girl I picked.  I have had three Korean massages here and the first was excellent, with a lovely, flirty girl who gave me my first and only cat bath which was lovely.  The other two Korean massages were unremarkable so I haven't been back since, especially as the last one didn't do the CBJ as advertised.  That said, the CBJ seems to only last for a few minutes before switching to HJ.  For these reasons I haven't returned.  It is a nice place, with an average service, but you can get better service, for less money, and choose the girl elsewhere.


The second type of massage is a chinese massage, which starts off like a regular massage and ends with hand relief.  However the massage is neither erotic, nor trained and the girl is clothed throughout.  So I quickly learned to avoid this option.  My first HJ here was great, and on my second visit I was also offered nudity and a CBJ, however by then the price tops $180 and you might as well have just gone straight for the Korean which is at least nude and B2B throughout.


In conclusion, not a bad place, but nothing spectacular and a bit pricey.
However judging from the messages on auxxxreviews I might give it one last try if #200 is working.

My experience/comments: going to babylon in market city is a bit hard to find at first, up the escalators and down a side corridor. once there you have a menu to choose from, I chose the Korean massage. A sauna or steam before and after massage is great. Waiting in the big armchairs, someone comes to get you and leads you to your room. I asked to choose my girl. Once decided, off with the clothes and the massage starts. Good body 2 body, and licking all over, especially the balls. Before I knew it she slipped a condom on using her mouth and gave a good CBJ. She then slid up and gave a good HJ to finish while licking my nipples.

Value for money/recommend?: Yes

My experience/comments: Having been to Babylon several times I was blown away by this particular visit. It was on a quieter night (recommended) and for the first time I was given a 'picture menu' to choose my preferred masseuse. I chose Kara, fully expected her delicious petiteness and amazingly pretty face to be vastly photoshopped and not matching to the reality. I was wrong. She was unbelievable. Greeted me in lingerie, gave me the best massage i've had for years (especially in an R&T joint) and didn't just HJ and CBJ with real affection, but lay in my arms and kissed me. Incredible stuff. 
The problem with this place is that they don't always give you the choice, and even when they do, the girls are identified by a number, not a name. Buggered if i can remember the number. Next time i'll ask by name.

Value for money/recommend?: Acceptable..not mind blowing

My experience/comments: Visited approx 9pm on a Friday. Was busy enough and offered the choice of #700 and #888. I never pay much attention to the album, and asked the receptionist to choose. Normally they will..this time she said "both are same". So I figured I would take #700 since #888 might be ultra popular with that number.

When I first entered, she seemed so sultry, whimpering hello. For the first time I nearly contemplating asking for #800 whilst the receptionst was still at the door. Anyway I persisted. Therapeutic massage awful, she also vanished for 10 mins to get those towels (is this a tactic?). When it came to the erotic portion, she was a better tho. Managed to turn me on, she was trimmed, so got a nice view. CBJ was done in such a way my hands could go no where, but she went deep and let me enjoy..so the only reason I would say acceptable as it was some decent CBJ.  Not sure if I will keep going back to this place. I always consider it a safe bet, but at $180 i think value can be had elsewhere for the same level of erotica

I have walked past this place so many times that I cannot remember and have not once wanted to step foot into.. Strange.. There are huge advertisements on the street on the wall of the interior..

I think Oriana in Chatswood is far far superior and even not that far away is Masstige8.. Both abit more $$wise but so so better value..

Value for money/recommend?: Yes

My experience/comments: After reading the reviews on here I decided to give this place a try, little difficult to find (Walk past the Restrooms on Level 2). Tried reading the menu, the receptionist just told me to take the top one. Paid up and was led off to the lockers, they give you a key and the towel jockey shows you where to put your crap. Handed a towel and was pointed towards the showers, here you walk past a dipping pool and sauna. After shower the towel jockey handed me a pair of shorts to wear that a clown would laugh at, robe then into the waiting room. Its room full of lazy boys aimed at the TV screens. Offered a drink, she came back with a glass of Lemonade (Flat!), hope my ML wasn't going to be as flat. The chairs all have stools and a few other punters were getting foot massages and figured i'd be getting one before my massage. Turns out I wasn't, one of the young pimps bought over the album for me to look at but straight away recommended a girl for me #500, reading the reviews here I took that lead and agreed to his choice. I wonder if the girl gives them a kick back for recommending them to the punters?...I digress, was led down to the dungeon and the lady was waiting for me in the room. They always call out before going down, guess its to minimize punter traffic. Dark red room, couldn't really see the girl but i stripped and layed down. Heated blanket under the table? this was new to me, man I was cooking. She dumped a 40 gallon drum of baby oil on me and we were away, she didn't say a word, I think its more sexy when you converse a bit. After the oil rub it was on with the heated hot wet towels, this will be great I thought, water and electric blankets go together well, I'm sure. She walked on my back and managed to shift a few vertibrae back into place. Off with the towels and I was cooked. She then went to the sink and was messing round with Detol and a bottle (could smell it). I could watch that girls cute ass all day. After she finished at the sink she layed down some more towels and squirted me with this slippery mixture and began a lovely body slide, I was kind of enjoying it but had a small cut on my foot so I could feel her sexy body rubbing mine and stinging antiseptic on my foot.
Flipped me over and began the BJ. I love BJ's like the next man but the noise she made sounded like a drain flushing. Was going a little soft at the noise and she finished me off with a HJ. We chatted afterward and she works 12 hours a day and dosen't sound like the girls get a break at all.
What's the story on tipping here? theres a note in the room saying they appreciate it but you dont see the girl again as you shower alone and leave?
Either way I had a good time and would return.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, fantastic

My experience/comments : After a miserable time at Oriana in Chatswood I headed here about 8pm on a Wednesday night.
Now I had been here many years before and had a great time but was unsure of what had changed as it had been a long time.
I walked in and was greeted at reception very quickly; told to go that way and pay later.... I said ok, but how much does it cost, she said is this your first time - I said yes :-S and she said ok, it's ok go that way and you pay later.  I was a little nervous at this, I did know the cost as I saw the menu and had been reading on here.  Anyway, off to the shower, on with the over size shorts and tiny gown.  I then take a seat and the host comes over and says so this is your first time, I say yes again and then he shows me a book with photos of girls and numbers.  They all look lovely I say and I ask him for his suggestion - he said I should go with 999 or 007.  I pick 999.  A few minutes later he comes back and says that it's going to be $188 and is that ok, I feel relief and say no worries at all.  I can now relax knowing I'm not going to be ripped off blind like I was in Hong Kong!  I'm then led to the room where I meet a very friendly and pretty 999.
Her body was just fantastic; young firm, slim, curvey and breasts to die for.
She undresses me and asks me to lay down.  We start of with the  normal massage which included a good walking on my back and legs - which felt great.  She then asked me to roll over and she started to go to work on me.  The massage was devine, she rubbed her breasts all over my body with a nice coating of oil.  Things were going along nicely and then started to heat up with her grinding her pussy up my legs and then up onto my stomach.  She then started griding down very close tot he action which was a real turn on and got my interest happening.  She then moved off and there was more kissing down my body and to my shock and delight a brief but delightful bbbj.  I was hard and she then fitted the condom and back to cbj.  She then stopped and started with the pussy griding again, this time right on top of me, it was all i could do not to grab her and fuck her.  She knew it, I was so turned on and was begging her to put me inside her, but she giggled and said no sorry I cant.  This didn't stop us rubbibng together and my dick trying desperately to get in side her.  With her on top it was a battle I knew I wouldnt win, but it felt awesome with my dick rubbing and hovering around her entrance.  This continued with a few short kisses and lot of intimate body action before I finally let go.
I was then cleaned a up, we had a lovely chat and then I was on my way.
An amazing girl and can't wait to get back again.

Age : I guessed 23 - she agreed, so probably older, but she looked 23

Size/shape : Small and slim. Typical cute japanese body.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

Services Provided : Massage, bodyslide, little catbath, CBJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes. It worked for me at the time.

My experience/comments : Afterreading the reviews, I smiled to reception and just took a locker key rather than ask questions, there. led to my locker, undress, great, hot and strong shower, helped into shorts and robe and directed to relaxing area. First thing I noticed was the surprising lack of Chinese girls, here - not that I minded, but it was surprising, and had the added benefit that with Chinese, Korean, Japanese staff, they all seem to speak reasonable English.

I waited about 5-10 minutes before I was attended, and the obviously new girl tried to show me who was available and asked what I wanted. A much prettier girl - both were Japanese - who showed me the 6 girls who were available. I chose Miki, no. 600, as I like small girls.

After another wait, I was led down to the room where miki was waiting. Very cute girl and large room. The heater was on and to my great pleasure, the large massage table had an electric blanket on it, under the towels, so it kept me warm and relaxed throughout the hour.

Massage was just OK - she isn't too talented. It included some bad-walking but did a lot of good, as I was nearly asleep by the time the slide came around. Nice hot oil felt very pleasant and even with her small breasts, she gave me a nice slide on both sides.

A little catbath and then down to CBJ. No HJ at all... straight to BJ and she worked hard at it. She was down between my legs so I couldn't touch her. I asked her to stand next to me instead so I could touch her. Nice small titties to play with, and her pussy, covered in oil, was lovely to touch, along with her pert, firm bum and got me off quickly. She was very cute and did everything I needed, but a little more connection would have been nice.. maybe next time.

I returned here last Saturday for the first time in about a year.  I have avoided this in the past as my last experience was hardly spectacular and I find it very pricey compared to other places like Masstige 8.  In short, I was disappointed and won't return.  I asked for a Korean massage and they asked for the money upfront.  I queried this as normally at Babylon I would pay at the end.  However, most places take cash up front so I asked to see the girls first.  I was concerned that there would just be one crusty girl to choose from, so the $188 for an hour would not represent great value.  But they told me there were lots of girls available, so like a fool I parted with my money. 

Normally at Babylon, you will not meet the girl, but you will be presented with a book of photographs, which may or may not resemble the girl you eventually meet.  However on this occassion I was just escorted to a room.  I queried this as I was told there were lots of girls.  "No just one girl.  More girls in one hour" I was told.  I made a mental note to give a bad review and went in to the room.  I really was annoyed by this.  I was blatantly lied to.  This annoys me more than a bad massage, because it is so dismissive of my custom (which they won't get again).

The massage itself was quite good as the girl knew how to massage, although she was a little hyperactive, I actually found this strangely charming.  

However I recommend that auxxxreviews punters vote with their feet and avoid this joint.  We all accept that YMMV with the girl, but when the massage joint itself treats you with contempt they don't deserve your repeat custom.

Person's Name : #888

Establishment : Babylon Health Centre

Date of Visit : 6 Aug 2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Haymarket Shopping Centre

Hours of Business : ?

Rates : $188 / 1hr

Age : Estimate 26-28

Size/shape : Small and slim. Standard fit Korean body as you would expect here.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean

Services Provided : Massage, bodyslide, light kisses on my body (suction), CBJ

Value for money/recommend? : Acceptable, but value for money is decreasing.

My experience/comments : I have posted a few threads for this joint as it is " my usual". ie. its local, easy to access incognito, shower is on your own time,  and you always know what you will get.

After the shower I was led into the waiting room. Offered a choice of a few girls, I normally asked the recepionist for their recommendation for a "fun" massage. (side note: I wonder if the receiptionists make educated choices, or if they simply rotate a gal that needs the shift, or it is random?)

Anyways was led into the room and she was an attractive gal. She was not overly chatty, but certainly not unfriendly or bored. I don't know if I am just bored of this routine, or I just wasnt into it that day. The hard massage and hot towel treatment was good, but we all wait for the wet massage right? Had some fun, she had no hesitation sliding her body over me and letting me observe in the mirror. Copped a few suction kisses on my back before I turned over. Cat bath continued and got a semi decent cbj. It felt good, but certainly not enough ball play like i like, it was very focused on the covered shaft. At this stage I was rock hard too...I decided to cum in this fashion so told her to keep going. After I blew, standard clean up and we had a bit of time so I asked for my neck to be massaged for another 10 mins or so.

To be honest, altho this place is reliable and safe, for $188 there is now better value to be had elsewhere, or perhaps the thrill of this place has done its mileage for me (approx 2-3 yrs). However, if you want a place where you can clean yourself to your hearts content with no time limits, enjoy privacy of enter and exit, and occasional use of the sauna - this place can kill a few hours nicely.

Is this place like the Sth Asian places where you can have a sauna/spa for an hr or so first to relax, all for the same price? Or is the continue "extras". 
CC payment available?

Thanks.

Person's Name :   Nr 999.

Establishment : Babylon Health Centre - Market City

Date of Visit :   10 October 2011

Rates :   $198

Size/shape :   Curvy, yet not overweight - just right

Nationality or Ethnicity :   Asian

Services Provided :   Bodyslide and CBJ

Value for money/recommend? :   Absolutely

My experience/comments : This place is a wonderland.
Having read about it on this forum, when I came to town I had to check it out. After selecting the Koeran massage, having a shower and coming back to the main waiting area, I was presented with a book of photos and numbers. 999 was available and she looked awesome, so I went with her. 

She was the exact shape I like. I don't like the skinny Asians. This girl had nice cans, flat abs and legs without any excess weight. 

The bodyslide was fantastic, with her ample chest softly rubbing all over my relaxed form. By the time she flipped me over and wacked on the dom, I was ready to let go and totally did so after about a minute.

This place will be a must for my visits to Sydney. The only downside is that I don't really like walking about in the sauna area naked, with other dudes also naked.

I agree. It is not the cheapest. 
I believe some of the other bigger places are about the same price. 
It's the same as any industry. Some places will require a premium, and others will be budget priced. 
Then, it's all up to the consumer of the service to determine what they want to outlay.
I steer away from some of the cheaper places. A practice adopted out of experiencing them.
A lot of privates are quite inexpensive. I go to them regularly.

Value for money/recommend? : Oh yes

My experience/comments : I'd been here a few times, but no point in doing another review the same. Instead of picking the usual Korean girls, I asked a Chinese girl.
The girl looked a little confused, no book to choose from., so she asked me what kind of massage I wanted, I choose Strong. She looked at her clip board and left for a bit then came back. 
You sure, she asked? you want young girl?
Nope, strong massage. She looked at me like i was a bit of on idiot.
OK we only have 1 girl for strong massage, but she's a "little" older.
No problem, was lead off to the room, just off the lounge room area on the same level.
Guess the keep the poor Korean girls in the basement.
So if the the average girl is 20-25 years old, a little older might be 30-35 years old?
...no
I think in Chinese, a little older equals twice as old. 

Waiting for me in the room was at least a 40 yr old MILF. I'm fine with anything and am not opposed to an experienced lady.
She was wearing a cute pink strappy dress and proceeded to give me a very good and strong massage. Not too chatty, a bit of back walking. 
She then stripped off her dress, nothing on underneath. Lovely firm breasts and lovely pussy.
Gave me a great body slide on my back, she hoped off and told me to turn over, by this time I was already at her full attention. She was leaning over me giving me an OK HJ then proceeded to a cbj. It was good, I was rubbing her pussy as her ass was close to my face. Most girls hover down the end of the table. She leaned over my face while giving me a nice strong HJ, letting me suck on her pencil eraser nipples, she was loving this, stopped the HJ and let me have full access to suck as long as I wanted. I was rubbing her pussy as she got back to the CBJ, i wanted a bit more and got her to mount me and put that wet juicy pussy in my face, which she was more than happy to do.
Now most of these girls give you a noisy but yet ultimately lazy ass BJ and finish you off with a HJ.
Oh not this sexy lady, I was enjoying myself on her pussy as she was on my cock, must have been going for 10 mins, I swear she just clamped down on my whole tool and didn't let go until she drained me completely out of juice.

We had a little chat when we finishes, she works everyday as it sounds like she's not often picked because of her age, everyone wants the young girls.

When I go to these places, I want a great massage and sexy happy ending and to kiss and suck anything i want (with in reason) and as this is not a full service joint, I think this was the best experience I've had here.

So if you frequent this joint and maybe want something a little different or little better, take a punt on number 002.

Rates : $18 (but I got a discount, read on)

Age : 20 ish

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean

Services Provided : Body slide, CBJ, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Sort of

I've been to Oriana once and had a similar but not quite as good experience.  It depends on the girl you get.  This was in the morning on a weekday, I was in Darling Hbr and decided to check this place out as I had heard about it here.  I went in and asked an explanation of the prices, Korean Massage was like $188 but included BJ.  I decided to try it even though it's a lot of money.  She then tells me the hot water isn't working, so she only charged me $120 or something, I wasn't sure what she said and just stuffed the money in my pocket.  I got undressed in the locker room and took my key.  This young guy who doesn't speak a word of English gives me a towel and I have a fkn freezing shower.  Then he gives me these pink silk pajamas and I think they might be for the girl, but nope, gotta put them on.  OK!

Off to the TV room now, they offer me a drink and I decline.  She offers a foot massage for extra, no thanks, just paid a bundle for a cold shower.  She shows me the book, they are those funny asian glamour photos, you can't tell what the girl actually looks like so I just pick one.  Winner!  After a few minutes they take me downstairs and there she is.  I nice lingerie, maybe 21-22 years old, and she looks like this 22 year old Korean exchange student that lived with us a while back, so I'm stoked.  She is beautiful, almost perfect.  The massage is all business, she's reasonably good and still has her gear on.  After about 20 min of that, she gets her gear off and starts the body slide.  It feels great having her body against mine.  When she flips me she lets me feel her pert little tits but I can't play with her pussy "sorry" she says.  She looks like she might actually be sorry, but she's not allowed.  That's what I tell myself.

Then she puts a condom on me with her mouth and makes a great effort sucking my cock.  She can't deepthroat me and there is no way I'm going to come even though I'm enjoying it.  I desperately want to fuck this little beauty from behind but it will never happen.  She finishes me with her hand expertly.  

Now - is it value for money?  At $120 if I got this girl I'd be very happy.  Even at $188 if I always got her I'd keep going back on the off chance that eventually I get to hit it.  But $188 for bodyslide and CBJ from an unenthusiastic average looking girl wouldn't be great...that's why I'm undecided on value.  But I'll probably go back.  Really wish I had paid more attention to her number.

My experience/comments : I'd been here before, tired a few different girls, but i keep cumming back for number 002, I'd say shes the most mature lady there, but by no means awful in looks or body. Tasty B's and large nipples which she dosen't mind me sucking on.
So I've done a review on her before and probably seen her 3 times over 6-8 months, so she knows me now.
So usual thing was going on, she was giving me a nice CBJ and I was dining on her pussy as she dosen't mind letting me have a taste.
Now, any one who has been here know this is a pretty much standard rub and tug at the higher end of the market and as your session enhancer aka wallet is safley locked away in the locker the subject of extras here is a bit of a mute point...or so I thought.

So I'm eating her out as I'm lying on my back and must have got her going as she began to shudder and jump a few times, then she began to moan and lean back in to me to make sure my tongue could get in deeper. She was loving this and got up, i think just to catch her breath and turned around to let me have another good suck of her lovely nipples. After a little of this she switched back to the BJ and letting me dine some more, her moans and shiver's continued. 
Then without a word she got up switched around and planted herself down on my cock and began to ride the hell out of me.

So I'm thinking 
A) What the hells going on here and 
B) This is great

She continued to ride me as I was stroking her nipples and squeezing her breasts, eventually I was about to explode and not wanting to be rude I tried to lift her off so i could do so in a gentlemanly fashion, i.e. not in her. But she wouldn't have a bar of it. I was a little worried but came anyway, It was only then I had relaised that she had put the condom on before the BJ, so we were both safe.
The poor girl then collapsed on me trying to catch her breath, grinning and moaning. Think the old girl hadn't had this much fun in awhile. Glad I could help her out.

Massage continued after cleanup, we chatted a bit. Then times up, I had left her a small tip a few times as she's always gone that extra mile with me. And I had planned to leave her a larger tip this time. But she then asked me for a tip, of course I said sure, we settled on 100 extra for the unexpected ride.
she said she can call the front desk and add it to my bill, so i thought OK.

Now for a little bitching and moaning (On my behalf)
At no point did I ask to have full sex, but she hopped on anyway.
Even though I enjoyed it, still felt a little weird when she asked me for a tip, now I know these are all working girls and a tip of any kind can go a long way for them as I'm sure the house is taking its fair share, so I'm ok with it.

So I had a great time, If you want a little more from this place, I think you need to pick a regular girl and see her a few times so you can build a little trust or just let her know to add the "tip" to your bill. Front girl at the desk didn't bat an eyelid at the extra 100 on my bill, Standard $188 for the body to body massage + the $100 for my ride. $288 adds up in a hurry. As ever your mileage will vary, but I thought you might like to know what you can get up to in this place.

I feel a little violated...financially speaking, but no doubt I will return for more

Seems a bit rich for a R&T but its the experience that makes it worth while. Enter and am given a locker for my clothes, before putting on a robe and heading into the spa/shower/sauna room. Had a spa whilst I waited befire being ushered to the seating area where drinks, food and foot massages are offered. Evenutally taken into a room where my lady appears. She is gorgous, young and very firm!! Quite pleased with my lucky dip! She is completely naked and gets me onto my stomach for quite a good massage. Flips me over after about 25 mins and starts a face to face body slide, putting my cock between her tits. Allows plenty of tit grabbing. On with the dom and gives a few minutes of CBJ, great view in the side mirror! Dom off and proceeds to give a great HJ, allowing full brest touching and non=penetrative pussy rubbing. Finishes me off and then wipes me down  Shown back to the shower room where I had a shower, re dressed and left a satisfied man.

Person's Name: Random "Korean" chick - you pick them from a photo book

Establishment: Babylon Spa, Level 2, Market City, Sydney

Date of Visit: 14 March 2013

Contact Details: Level 2, Market City, 9 Hay St, Haymarket. (02) 92818886

Hours of Business: till late

Rates: $170 for "Korean" massage

Age: various, this time, late 20s

Size: B cup

Nationality: Asian

Services Provided: covered BJ, happy ending

Value for money/Recommend: yes, as a fail safe in Sydney

My Experience:

I've been to this place heaps of times.

It's got a legit feel to it, plus decent spa/sauna facilities.

The trick is to ask for a "Korean" massage.

On my most recent trip I arrived about 11pm and the place was really busy. A mix of blokes, a lot of Asian guys, western Sydney types.

You don't pay for the massage when you arrive - $170 - you pay at the end.

Book an hour long Korean massage. There are sauna facilities etc, I always like to shower, jump in the sauna for a while.

You walk out to the lounge, and sit down,

You get offered a drink, and they bring you a photo book of the available chicks. They tell you which chicks are available and which are busy.

I know from past experience the chicks rarely look as good when you see them as they do in the photo - so take your tome to pick well.

i had s choice of about 5 chicks and chose the one i thought would look good with my cock in her mouth. (They all would like fine actually)...

after you pick the one you want, you wait a couple on minutes and then a lady will come get you and lead you to your room.

If I had to say, my chick looked Japanese and late 20s. She had a nice small build, B tits, and a trimmed pussy (more hair than I like, but all the Asians seem to have hairy pussies).

You lay down nude and she started massage my back with oil.

She was wearing cute little pyjamas things.

The massage was quite good, relaxing. She stroken me and would rub against me throughout.

After about 45 mins, she asked me to roll over.

She then got naked and climbed on top of me, but straddled me with a leg on either side. She had her back to me, but leant forward do I had a good view of her cunt and asshole.

She then jerked me off a bit till I was hard, then rolled a condom on my cock using her mouth. Neat trick.

She did a decent job sucking my cock and jerking me.

To be honest I fucking hate condoms, so I told her to take it off and jerk me off with oil.

She then kept jerking my clock and really leaning forward so her wet pussy and asshole were just in front of my face.

After a while I blew and she cleaned me off with hot towels.

Then back to the shower, changed and left. You pay on the way out. I didn't leave a tip.

Age : looked 20 to me but I guess could be to 25 but not sure!

Size/shape : C cup, average

Services Provided : Body to Body, RNT

Value for money/recommend? : No/Yes

My experience/comments :

Didn't get to choose the girl I wanted like most people.  But ended up with Sarah and she had a cute face.  A little chubby but had a very firm ass and nice sized breasts. Very little english so not much talking but I prefer that anyway.

Started with a massage which wasn't remedial/therapeutic, but still nice and relaxing.  Then she stripped down and started the body slides which  and there is a mirror next to the bed so you can see everything that is going on. 

Told to turn over and straight into the body slides. After a few minutes, she sat up on me grinding her pussy on me and jerking me off at the same time.  Safe to say this felt amazing.  But I understand that the majority of people that have been to this place get CBJ and this didn't seem to be an option.  

I think I must have gone on a quiet night because there weren't many people there and I was expecting some CBJ and not just a RNT which is why it wasn't value for money.  But I would definitely recommend it as it can clearly be an amazing experience with the whole package.

This is the sort of place I go to when pissed. Bit this time I was sober!  The girl was young and friendly As usual the English was pretty poor.

Started off with the usual decent massage - and it was pleasant enough. Then the hot towel and fun begins. She then took her clothes off, and was happy to leave the lights on so you could actually see her - sometimes the dim them so much you are asking for candles. She was very obliging, and happy to engage in some mutual massage. It wasn't quite as erotic as I've had here (no CJB, or catbath) - but she did a great handjob and was good fun. I'd see her again.

I hadn't been here in a while - in the change rooms with the spa etc - there were a couple of groups of blokes - all wearing their shorts in the spa - WTF is that all about ?

Value for money/recommend?: Yes

My experience/comments: 

Feeling horny and being like a kid let loose in a candy shop decided to go for my second massage for the day after the reviews given here.  The Babylon Health Centre is really a hidden gem that Sydneysiders have.  There is nothing like this in the Nation's capital. 

The whole experience involves finding this place hidden away on the second floor of the Market City shopping centre.  A visually appealing entrance,  the locker allocation,  shower followed by sauna / spa,  then the relaxing room where you can join other men watching TV with drinks and a complimentary foot massage.  

No choice of ML though but pleasantly surprised with Judy.  She was attractive, had a sense of humour and looked hot wearing a diaphragmous outfit which revealed a sexy black bra and Gstring. 

Massage was quite good although a little firm for my liking,  she was really digging her elbows in during my back massage.  Started the massage dry,  then light oil followed by hot towels placed over the body whilst she ducked out for 5. Commenced a bodyslide on my back when she returned using Nuru massage like oil,  nibbled on my ears with slight moaning but not over the top stuff.  Turned over and more of the same,  nibbling on ears,  sucking on my nipples , did some Spanish ,  then was in reverse cowboy doing the HJ showing her shaved pussy and anus.  Didn't want me to touch the brown eye winking at me though :P With the visual treat! (she had a fantastic ass) and great HJ technique got me over the line. 

Another shower and amazed the bathroom had every type of toiletry on offer (including quality body cream for those with sensitive skin) 

Paid on the way out and will definitely be back.

Haven't been hear before.  Nice place to visit, nicely fitted out with a legit feel to it. 

Leave your clothes etc in a locker then shower sauna and steam.  Sauna was good, just right temperature.  Steam room was over the top for me after 5 min.  Another shower then on with shorts and wrap and into the common room for cup of tea and catch the news before a massage.  I wasn't offered a photo book so maybe they don't do this any more.

Escorted to one of the massage rooms where Tiffany was waiting.  Started off with a reasonable back and leg massage through a towel followed by the hot towel treatment. 

Tiffany then dimmed the lights, took her clothes off and started a B2B massage with some sort of very thick gel.  After a couple of minutes she had me roll over with B2B and limited cat bath on front.  She then squatted on my thighs and gave me HJ - CBJ and HJ to finish.  Gentle massage to finish then of to a shower, remember to pay at the front counter and out the door into the shopping center.

I reckon it was OK and will return when the mood/need strikes me for some leisurely spoiling.

On the basis of my visit yesterday, no time limits imposed, great place to unwind and relax as you wish.  Next time I go I reckon I will allow 2 hrs to get full value.  Not the sort of place to go for a "quickie".

The steam room and sauna are not timed. And there is also a spa to relax in. Depending on the time of day there could be other punters in the spa with you. It is quite big though. Once you go through to the waiting area you can get a foot massage ( at extra cost ) as you relax on a recliner. Once your massage starts it is then timed.

I went back here a couple of weeks ago - had Tiffany as well.  She did a pretty average massage followed by a 3 second CBJ and an equally ordinary HJ.  Not worth the money.  The only thing that saved the session were here spectacular tits.

I noticed an article in today's SMH about Ron Medich's murder trial and giving some publicity to Babylon massage.  The link is Gattellari is branded pimp, liar and thief .  Poor (un)Lucky Gattellari and Ron Medich seemed to spend quality time here although Lucky had a problem with the small rooms apparently.  I hope his current accommodation for the next 6 years has larger rooms.

Person's Name : Julie

Establishment : Babylon

Date of Visit : 23 October 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As previous posts

Hours of Business : As previous

Rates : 108/hr Spa sauna and massage

Age : early 20's

Size/shape : slim 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : Hey Mods, this place has changed, legit only, suggest move to pure massage.

After the last couple RnT's with missing T's, thought I would visit Babylon for a guaranteed luxury RnT.  Well folks, big fail ............ huge   For the sordid details, read on.

Arrived at the front counter and noticed the $188 Thai massage was covered over, however the $108 45min massage (all inclusive no tips to pay) was now the only massage offered.  I assumed they were short staffed or similar.

 They now want the money up front.  Usual locker for your clothes, shower, spa, sauna and steam room unchanged.  However .............. and this is a BIG however, male attendant in locker room asks if I want man or woman for massage  I wasn't expecting this.

When you go through to lounge, TV's, papers and mags all good.  I had just settled in a chair, only had a couple of sips of my juice and was still on the front page of the paper when Mamasan comes into view and insists that I have to go now as girl is ready for me this is not getting off to a good start.

I follow Mamasan to  a massage room where Julie is waiting for me.  Fully clothed in button up to neck jacket, long trousers and heavy shoes.  Not looking good.  I keep telling myself that this is Babylon and it will be OK   Clearly I was delusional.

I remove my spa boxers and jacket and l onto the massage table.  Julie leaves the lights on full BRIGHT and proceeds to give me one of the worst massages I have ever had.  Only my back and back of legs and most of it through a towel.  Boring random kneading on back and legs for about 30 min and less than 10 min oil massage on back.

On my way out past the front counter I said to the girl that things had changed since my last visit.  She said "we have changed, only massage now, very sorry"

On the basis of this visit, not worth returning for the straight massage.

What?? Has the world gone nuts?? This can't be true, I have spend some memorable experiences in this joint, this is really surprising.  I guess something really went bad down here recently which forced the owners to go all legit. The question is, how long this joint will remain as a legit operation, I guess time will tell..

Yes BigM, I was completely gobsmacked!.  I cannot imagine how they will survive as a legit shop if they continue to offer service similar to what I experienced yesterday.  Perhaps the council or shopping centre owner has been on their case recently.  

Anyway, I won't be back unless the story changes.

OK, since no one has bothered to reply, I thought I call up the shop myself to find out:

Speaking Mandarins to a girl on the phone and she said the Korean body to body massage is still available @$188/hr

I then asked her about the all inclusive massage (with HE) at the Chinese section and she was a bit reluctant to tell me, just keep saying it's same as before.

She passed the phone to a guy and he told me the same: just come in and have a look, everything is the same, nothing changed! But he won't tell me the price.

So from what I hear, I would say it's business as usual.

It's pretty straight forward for the KB2B, I'm sure if you pay $188, you will get what you are after.

A slight question mark on the Chinese side, I will certainly sort this out before I get changed in the locker room.

Just my two cents, hope this help

Cheers

Thanks Lungor,  sounds like they might have had some recent trouble with council, centre management or perhaps with cauc punters??.  Maybe I look like a council inspector??  

Anyway, It is great you have the language skills to be able to "delve" further into this matter.  

I have done enough TOFTT of late so will leave it to someone else to collect further intel.

Now I think about it, I was the only cauc punter there that I could see.

I think you could be right, this shop's main customer base is Asian and I suppose on the shop's point of view, in doubt, they rather play it safe !!

Hours of Business : 10:00am to 2:00am

Rates : $183/hour tips included

Age : 30's

Size/shape : Slim but strong

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Massage, body slide, Oral (on each other) HJ & some unexpected physiotherapy.

Value for money/recommend? : Oh yes

My experience/comments : Before the threads got re-arranged i saw a post saying things had gone south at this establishment. So i was hesitant about going back but when i saw the girl i had seen before this were as per normal.
Seen this girl a few times now and it's always been good. She's always offered me full service when i go in, so i can't complain. I haven't taken her up on it yet as i feel FS in these joints is a bit of a waste. But sayin that I have done it before and will do again.
Anyway she gives a seriously strong massage for a little woman, so much so it hurts at times, but i ask for hard and i get what i ask for.
I like to dine at the Y during my massages and shes always more than happy to let me eat.
Finishes me off with a nice HJ, the time before she managed to make me arrive during a covered BJ. This hasn't happened for me that way for years. I guess shes just good at her job, very enthusiastic even if her engrish is a little patchy.
The last visit i had some shoulder and neck pain, she offered to work on it at the end instead of the head massage. But instead of just rubbing the pain areas to death she went out (In her little towel) and came back with some deep heat type cream and proceeded to fix my pain. Great girl

So i left her a an extra tip at the reception desk when leaving, They tried to get me to stop saying tips were included. Odd, surely they have the girls interest's over ours??? anyway i still left her an extra $20 for fixing me neck and shoulder which felt great after.

Person's Name : #15 they only go by numbers in this place in the style of HK/Macau sauna. Numbers facilitate in easier bait and switch, not a fan

Establishment : Babylon Sauna and Spa

Date of Visit : Australia Day

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Level 2 of Market City next to where the tavern is. Walk towards the toilets

Hours of Business : Not quite sure but open till late I suspect

Rates : 188 for 1 hour massage + nude B2B

Age : mid 30s

Size/shape : Size 8-10 with C cup tits, I think she was trying to hide a scar on her body though with the lights dimmed

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, BBBJ, Nude B2B + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : No

I visited this place to try to revive some fond memories of Macau and Hong Kong punting from many years ago. Came away quite disappointed, maybe expectations were too high. Had the obligatory shower + getting dressed in their pyjamas. Went to sit in the TV area. Waitress comes up to me and asks me what I would like - I tell her I want a massage with all the extras for $170. She flat out denies they have this service. I'm thinking WTF, this is babylon. She must've thought i was an undercover cop or something as I think back. 

She asks me if I want a foot massage and I told her no, I want a proper massage in the rooms. She goes and talks with her colleague for a bit and comes back and decides to offer me the $188 service at which point I accept. Leads me downstairs to some massage rooms and then presents me with some Korean girls. These aren't the sort of girls you find at Midas or Romeos, not even close, these were wildebeast. Caked up makeup, spray on tans, big fat girls I was turned off immediately and told the waitress that I'll wait for another. She tells me they have a Chinese girl

I go back and sit in the TV area for about 15 minutes and then get led to a different set of massage rooms. This time a chinese woman walks in and I give her the eye, she passes the 'can I come with her jerking me off' test. Get the usual weakish massage followed by B2B and HJ in very very dim lighting. I'm lamenting the fact that I didn't spend my money at Romeos or even 2 punts at 316.

Overall experience was 6/10. I'd rather pay more for cauc massage or less at a better value asian parlour

Person's Name : Rose

Establishment : Babylon

Date of Visit : 19/6/14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business : Open till late

Rates : $188

Age : Late 20's

Size/shape : 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean

Services Provided : HJ CBJ B2B

Value for money/recommend? : Yes 

My experience/comments :

I decided to visit Babylon after a hard night and then morning of watching the socceroos gallantly lose to Holland, plus some gambling and drinking at Star City. I havent been to Babylon for over a year as I have a regular ML at a shop elsewhere but shes on holiday at the moment. I was a bit anxious as I had previously read on these forums that the services here have changed, but on arrival it was business as usual. Same prices and services as a year ago, $188 for Korean massage, a bit less for Chinese. The menu did say "no tips" I think thats new, not that I would want extras after paying this much.

I was feeling a bit crusty so a shower was welcome. It was still late morning so the shower and pool area was empty. To beat any rush I headed straight to the waiting area and took a seat. Mamasan took my number and asked what I felt like, so again I said Korean massage. I ordered a juice which was ordinary, and not long after the young lady serving drinks asked me if I was ready. No book to choose numbers from, it was gonna be a lucky dip.

I was lead down stairs to a room and was introduced to Rose. Im not sure what number she is. At a guess she is late 20's, nicely shaped size 8 figure with small natural breasts. Nice looking, I wouldnt call or beautiful or ugly. Massage through a towel to start, then a massage with oil but skipped my arms, calves and feet. She got some hot wet towels for some back walking, but didnt seem completely confident to walk with both feet on my back. She then went to get some cream, which seemed like ages and I was getting quite cold as the towels cooled down and the table wasnt heated.

When she returned she lubed me up for a body slide, then asked me to turn over and she started on a nice CBJ. This lasted for a few minutes, I wasnt yet very hard but she stopped like it was a timed event?, then she started another body slide. Unfortunately she didnt allow touching downstairs. This and a feeling of being cold stopped me from getting hard even after about 5 more minutes of bodyslide. Maybe I was shivering because she asked if I would like the heater on, which I did. Instead of more bodyslide and HJ I asked for another CBJ which she was happy to do. This one was much nicer and longer, with lots of eye contact which got me over the line. She cleaned up and then finished with a nice head massage, which is a nice touch and along with the back walking something I miss with my regular Chinese ML. A hug goodbye and I returned to the shower, making the most of the sauna and pool facilities. No point coming here otherwise imo. Not the greatest experience but a nice way to spend 2 hours all the same.

Person's Name : Tara

Establishment : Babylon

Date of Visit : Thu 22/02/18

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : They don't seem to have a web page.

Hours of Business : Open till late

Rates : $198/60 mins

Age : Late 20's

Size/shape : Tall, slim, reasonable size breasts

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean

Services Provided : Massage HJ CBJ B2B

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, for an occasional indulgence

My experience/comments : First I have to say I was very surprised by this place. I'd only even been to Paddy's Markets on the ground floor before and just assumed the higher levels were more of the same. So I was expecting this place to be very low rent. I could not have been more wrong!

The upper levels are actually a standard shopping centre. If you go up the escalator at the front and then take the next escalator on your left in the food court, you then just turn to the right at the top and go down what at first looks like a service corridor to find a surprisingly upmarket place. I paid for the Korean massage, was given a bangle with a locker number on it, and then walked up the ramp to the men's change area. I undressed and a bloke left me a towel and some some slip on sandals. I then went into the wet area. 

There was just one naked Asian bloke towelling himself off after a shower. I tried the pool, sauna and steam room and then had a shower. The attendant then gave me a pair of yellow boxers and short coat to put on and pointed me to the exit. I went into a lounge area and sat down. A young woman came over and offered me a drink, and I noticed there was a group of young men and women sitting nearby.

After I was brought my drink, another young woman came and asked if I was ready for the massage. She led me past a door labelled as the women's change room (so this place is unisex?) and down some stairs to the massage room.

I was greeted by Tara and she helped me undress and hung my clothes up. Her massage was reasonable, starting with dry massage covered with a towel, then she flipped the towel down to around my knees for an oil massage of my back and bum. She followed this with a hot towel massage and clean up. She then massaged my legs with everything covered by the towel.

She then stripped, rubbed her tits against my back and bum, and then told me to turn over and applied a dom. She gave me a good cbj and then removed the dom for a hj. She was careful to keep her body out of reach so there was no play at all. The hj was a little bit mechanical but it got me over the line. There was then some more massage and finally "finished!" She helped me dress and then I went back up to the change room, changed and left.

The facilities are very good but the service is not as good as Chequers was, particularly with the wet massage tables they had, not to mention the option for (expensive) fs. I actually think this place would be better if you had a mate to go there with and share the experience, as there were some young Lebanese blokes in the wet area there when I left, obviously having a good time together (with their yellow boxers on - it wasn't that sort of good time!)

Establishment : Babylon

Date of Visit : Sat 27/10/18

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : They don't seem to have a web page.

Hours of Business : Open till late

Rates : $198/60 mins

Age : Late 30's

Size/shape : Attractive, slim, small breasts

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Massage HJ BBJ B2B FS

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, for an occasional indulgence

My experience/comments : The modus operandi has changed here. There is no longer a sign at the counter with different prices for chinese and korean massage. If you want a massage (with a woman) the price is $198. Michelle told me you can ask for a chinese or korean girl, or a girl by name if you want, but the price will be the same as they provide the same service.

After using the sauna and pool facilities for a while, I was told by the attendant my massage was available. I put on the yellow pyjamas and took a seat in the waiting room and was then taken down the corridor to the room where Michelle was waiting.

Michelle gave me a good relaxing massaging, but not therapeutic. During the massage I could hear another punter in a room nearby and after a while the moans of a woman getting seriously pounded. I wondered if the type of service here had changed?

At the end of massaging my back and legs, Michelle gave me some truly excellent tackle tickle and anal play before asking me to turn over. She then asked if I wanted anything extra. Thinking about what I'd heard earlier, I asked if FS was available and she said yes, for $100. I had to put back on my yellow pyjamas and go and get the cash then as I wouldn't be able to go back to her with at the end. She said I had to pretend I needed to go to the toilet so the management wouldn't know. But if they saw me at my locker they would surely know? 

Anyway, I did that and she provided an excellent body slide, followed by skilful ball licking and bbj, and then put the dom on. She jumped on top and we fucked for a while and then I asked her to lie down and fucked her missionary. She really got into it then, and if there was anyone nearby they would have heard her, just as I had heard the other woman earlier.

This is an expensive place all up, but you do get to use the sauna and other facilities. Michelle was very pleasant and it was a good experience, but the cost means it is still only an occasional indulgence.

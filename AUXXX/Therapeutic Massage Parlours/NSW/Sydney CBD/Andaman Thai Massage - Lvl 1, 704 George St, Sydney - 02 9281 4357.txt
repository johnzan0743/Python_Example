I ventured past 3 Thai massage place's on George st (Haymarket area) recently and decided to check them out. I love a legit Thai place with a hot beautiful thai girl massaging me. No hot girl at Andaman, but an excellent 1hr oil massage for $80 from a kind easy going thai woman (maybe mid 20's).

I was walked into the middle cubicle and asked to remove clothing but keep underwear on. I asked politely if i could take them off, and she said "no problem". I never ask for a HJ i just love the tease and idea it could happen. To my big surprise, she didn't hesitate to massage my ass and have it exposed even while not massaging it. Turned over with a towel covering me, and yet again her hands teased me. she never gave a hint of HJ, but for a place that requests to keep your underwear on she got very close to my groin. Can't remember her name, but she was the "chubby girl".

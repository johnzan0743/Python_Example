Person's Name : The next person available

Establishment : Siam Princess

Date of Visit : 06/04/14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0452 080 755

Hours of Business : 9am til 9pm

Rates : $59 for 60 min oil massage

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : strictly legit massage

Value for money/recommend? : OK

My experience/comments : I was walking down George Street and saw a young Thai girl handing flyers out for Thai massage - it was very close to the other massage parlours that do offer HJ and more down by ClubX. Though this maybe worth a punt as if they need to get other customers from other massage shops maybe exttras would be available. Talked the girl and she took me inside the building shop number 5.

Went in and paid the money - girls are all dressed in Traditional massage uniform so maybe I should have left then. There's three massage tables only seperated by curtains. My masseuse told me to get fully undressed and get on table face down, so I left the towel off and waited fro her return. She quickly put the towel across by arse and legs. This was definately a no go - decided just to enjoy a traditional massage. The massage was great - ask for medium hard and got exactly that. I left 60 minutes later completely relaxed and there was no indication of any additional extras on offer. 

Would i go back - yes if I was in the mood for just massage for 60 this was a very good massage.

If this is the place I think it is then it's not at Wynyard. 
743 -755 George  St is south of Haymarket, almost at Railway Square / Central.

Lads, you might like to check out this place again. I just went back there and now there is a solid wall separating each cubicle (still curtains in the front).
I left my underwear on as I was asked to do so last time (not this time). I had a different girl this time - quite attractive. Her massage on the back of my legs was very sensual. I didn't ask, but i reckon i could have slipped her a little extra for a wristy and she might have agreed.

No I didn't ask her name, sorry. I did think that she had the most attractive face of the workers there. She would be early 30's with a slim figure and quite a pretty face. It's not "Perry" who is probably late 20's and gives an excellent deep tissue massage, but definitely no extras. I was there on a Tuesday morning, if that helps.

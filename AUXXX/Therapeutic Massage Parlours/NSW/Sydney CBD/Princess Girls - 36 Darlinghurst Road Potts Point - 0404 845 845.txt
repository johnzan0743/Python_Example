My experience/comments :Had a hankering for Indian fare and was sent a PM that this place had a few although to be fair the PM did say that it was untried so it was definitely a case of Caveat Emptor.



As I walked in and asked for intros I passed the girls waiting pit and one remarked on my size and sniggered, I am not a small unit, and they all laughed and at that point I almost walked, but didn't and waited for the intros'. The first in was attractive and appeared to be fun with a little bit of attitude so I asked her if she was the one who made comment and she said yes. So fuck it you can be the one that wanks me off.



The room is tasteful and large with a shower and a spa  so a shower first up was in order.

Sonia came in and stripped to reveal a good body as she admired herself in the mirror. 



She had tickets on herself with prices that reflected that such as $100 for a BS or $150 for a CBJ and DATY extra.



I declined all of those and said just a tug and massage is fine .For the next hour all she did was try and up sell.



I got her to position herself in various poses as she tugged away and tit touching and outside pussy play was permitted but no clit or VIP allowed unless paid for.



It was like going to a restaurant where every other item is extra, salad, fries, beans and the bill comes its fucking rediculous.



Anyhow I shot the bishop as she continued telling me how good she was and would be easier next time if I has a BS or CBJ. 



Sweetheart there is no next time.

I'm guessing "body-slide".  (And sorry to be pedantic but it's and abbreviation not an acronym.)

The rub n tug scene in Sydney's CBD is starting to mirror Melbourne's.  Chicago on Pitt st, they now want 120 instead of 100 for 30 mins nude bodyslide and hj.  The 100 remains but u only get a swedish massage with clothed hj.  The 50 nude hj is no longer exciting for the business anymore, and the girls just like they do in Melbourne, are trying to extract a lot more now.  Thankfully Sydney brothel sector remains as good as it can get anywhere in Australia.

Was in the Cross and there's a notice on the shop entrance stating the landlord's have taken control of the premises. Looks like the business has gone under.

If it is in fact body slide it's an acronym. A hyphen doesn't make it one word, simply a compound verb or noun.

Services Provided : nhj

Value for money/recommend? : no

My experience/comments :
Went there a few weeks after it opened after seeing a few cauc girls rostered on. Didnt get to meet any cauc girls as I was told they didnt show up despite calling earlier to be told they were available.
Introduced to 1 girl, Jessica who was very shy and just stood at the door for about 2 seconds before leaving. Told I would go and then asked to wait 5 minutes for another girl. About 30 seconds later, another girls shows up, very bubbly an cheerful but jessica had a nicer body and face.
The male manager said lots of extras available with the other girl which I wasnt after so went with Jessiva since I was already there. 
Jessica only just started and was very shy and doesnt seem to like doing it. Shower in the room with the water temperature hard to control.
She got nude from the start but wouldnt allow touching between the legs. Massage was poor. She does have slight indian odour but not too bad. I had to direct her through the whole session.
She is nice and happy to talk and has a nice body but just too limited and inexperienced with her services.

She appeared on the roster of a pyrmont shop earlier this year.

The male owner also had shops in parramatta. Not too good to deal with.

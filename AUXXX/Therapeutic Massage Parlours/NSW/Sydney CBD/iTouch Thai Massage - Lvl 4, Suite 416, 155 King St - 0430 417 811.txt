[COLOR=#333333]Just went out to do my banking and bumped into a Thai lad handing out flyers.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]Will take one for the team next week if I get a chance. Wonder if extras are on order ? [/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]BTW, I know this building is only open business hours, so with this shop being open until 9.00pm 7 days they'll need to come down to street level and let you in, as per their note on the bottom of the leaflet. [/COLOR]

I visited this place on Friday night after work. Didn't stay for a massage because the only person free to massage me was a guy. Didn't have time to wait for the girl to finish with another customer. Fairly private near the back corner of the floor. Nice decoration with minimal lighting. Only curtains separate the massage beds. Not much room around the beds either. Intend to return to give it a try.

Better hurry up....with a name like that won't be long before Apple closes this place down.  They probably own the patents to Thai Massage anyway.

Had a massage at this place last Friday night with Ann, an attractive slim Thai girl of about 28.

The introductory prices on the flyer above are a thing of the past. A 1 hour oil massage cost me $79.

When I wasn't asked to leave my underwear on and there was seemingly extra attention to the bum cheeks early on, I was encouraged. Unfortunately it didn't get any more exciting than that. The massage was slightly better than average, but there was no tickle tackle or anything close to it. She kept her distance and everything was very legit and professional.

The curtains between the beds are very thin and you can see shapes and movement through them when you look at them at certain angles. You would probably need the rooms either side of you to be empty to have any chance of getting a handjob or something more. 

Saw one other girl when I was leaving. She was about the same age and a little more appealing.

If you are looking for an expensive, slightly better than average Thai massage, from a pleasant young lady without any eroticism, then this may be the place for you. If the other girls offer the same service, then it's not for me. I doubt I will return.

A thai girl I know called 'Summer' told me she is working at this shop on Saturdays now. She used to work at 288 Wattle and also in Sussex Street 398?

She is a bit fuller and round. I like her big ass. She is limited an only offers a nude HJ.

I went to this place when it was Arom Thai. It was definitely legit then and had to leave undies on and no extras or HE. That was about a year ago so it looks like things have changed with the new business name.    :-)

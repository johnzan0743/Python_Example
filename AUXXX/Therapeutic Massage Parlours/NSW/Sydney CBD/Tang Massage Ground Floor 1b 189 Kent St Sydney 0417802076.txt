My experience/comments : 

A couple of weeks back I was heading to the Lord Nelson to catch up with some friends and I noticed that the old massage place - straight massage - had changed hands to Tang. So took down the details and made a booking for today. From my discussion with Yan - she is the only lady that works here. She works Monday to Friday on the above times - but sometimes opens late if no bookings. With my experiences with the variety of Tang establishments I was not sure what to expect. The place has 2 small massage rooms, I am assuming if business goes well then they may get another girl. Anyway went to the room at the end of the corridor and paid over the money for 45 minutes. Stripped and onto the bed.

Yan returned and said what sort of massage did I want and I said strong not weak - wanted to see what this girl could do. Now I am laying on the bed in the buff with my junk laying down between my legs saying hello and she has not covered me up, mmm I think I might be getting lucky. The massage commences and it is best to say that it is not strong but a medium to weak at best. She uses a combination of elbows and hands to begin with no oil. This goes on for around 15 minutes before she starts the oil massage. The oil massage is a bit of a push massage with no real strength. At around the 30 minute mark she works her way down to my legs and I am waiting for the sign, the old accidental TT - no luck . She works her way up the second and still no TT. So I ask the question and no HJs available here. Another 10 minutes of average massage and the warm towels - not hot - come out and clean up the little bit of oil. I dress and leave.

Yan is a cheerful and quite chatty, but she can't massage. This place also does waxing etc for those interested. On the whole if you want a straight massage there are better places to go. If you want anything more then don't go here.

Haha called Lily yesterday and she is the owner and working at the George Street shop. Even said she would come across to Artarmon shop and look after me. She will look after you, seek her out, not outstanding but one to cross off the bucket list.

If the Artarmon shop is the one at 44 Hampton Road, then the lady in there is not service orientated and HATES providing male service, $50 for a 30 min and a HJ only reluctantly.

I'd skip this place.

So shagging the boss is the way to go. It's a shame that her employees don't follow her rules.

Will need to try her out.

Good advice in general, always start at the top, works for women (boobs first), my knob and management restructures

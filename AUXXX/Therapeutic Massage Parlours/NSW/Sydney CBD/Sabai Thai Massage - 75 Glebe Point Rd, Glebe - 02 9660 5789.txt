This place is a very legit massage joint, heaps of women go here for a great massage. I have a been a few times and had excellent legit massage from various girls strictly no extras however June provides an excellent RNT plus a great massage which is very descreet and does not cost any extra, it is all done in complete silence and do not make any sounds to give it away to the other girls you are being given an superb tug. 

Great massage and great tug.

There seems to be a few of these (Sabai) shops around. There is one at 143-145 Oxford Street, Darlinghurst and another in Bondi Junction. 

IIRC the Bondi Junction one is legit. Does anyone have any intel on the other Sabai shops ?

I have been to the one at 143 Oxford Darlinghurst many times. They often sell discounted deals on these daily web sites. I have bought a 60 min or 75 min massage for $39 and you can choose from traditional thai or oil. I usually choose oil. Most of the time they tell you to leave your underwear on but if they don't mention it then I take it off in the hope of a stray hand. No such luck though. the closest that I have got is when they use the hot towel to take the oil off and may touch your balls by mistake. 

It is a great place to go if you just want a massage as the massage is top class but too professional if you want some fun.

145 Oxford st is legit.  I have been several times and have never had the slightest hint that they would do anything.

they used to give you pants to wear.  Not sure if they still do.

Ive been pitching tents, hinting, asking, moving my hips so they touch me and nothing.... Eye contact avoided and they just massage!

On a plus side, its a good massage

Just tried this place out due to the review posted above - I've been here once before with June, who gives an awesome massage. The first time round I was pitching a tent like no tomorrow, but there was no happy ending as it was "my first time" I figured this was a precautionary measure on June's part, so I booked in for a week after my first session and this time I wasn't disappointed. Started out like a regular massage, but about 5 minutes in she reached down and pulled my briefs off. It was then I knew this session would be memorable. So she starts the oil massage, lightly touching my balls and member throughout, before she asked me to flip over and goes to work on my legs. More purposeful brushing of my dick, before sitting in between my legs, massaging my stomach and then going to town on my member. She really knows how to work it, kept me on edge for a good few minutes before grabbing the base with one hand and proceeding to vigorously massage my cockhead with the other one. Great massage, great handjob and lovely clean up. Very friendly, but as the first review said make sure to keep your voice down so as not to alert the other girls. She is doing this because she loves it, and didn't want a tip - it was all included in the price!!

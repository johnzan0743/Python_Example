I travel pass this place everyday on the bus to work, so I thought I would try my luck as it had a very similar shop front to Ninth massage on Newtown. By that I mean big painted windows of massage and thai-ness details. I Rang ahead and asked for the price of a one hour oil massage. The reply was "Oil massage starts from $85 for one hour sir". Now, the last time i heard the line "Starts fromÂ…" in regards to an oil massage it was a RnT joint. I went with hight hopes.

FAIL.

When she implies a choice, it's simply aromatherapy or a mix of aromatherapy and Thai. Fuck it, I was here. I would see how it goes. Same as Soul Central I was told to leave my underwear on and that was the confirmation of a legit place for me. The young woman who massaged me was incredibly cute and sincere. As this place is in an area I have no need to visit I won't be going back. 

It's a professional shop with lovely staff, just minus that extra something this board likes to highlight

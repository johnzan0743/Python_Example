 Eternity Massage - 375 Riley St, Surry Hills - 02 9211 5880 / 02 9211 1790
				
Post Content: 
dropped in friday night to check out this "revitalised" establishment around 8pm - as punters are aware jasmines + 1 blackburn street have taken over the touch of class building - 377 riley street continues to trade as ATOC whilst a korean style b2b operates at 375 - really  they are numbers only as both doors lead to the same reception area. i had never been to ATOC before and was keen to have a look around.   

eleswhere  reports had detailed an "abundance" of ladies available when it opened on 20 january - but "the guy" (at all times he was rather vague as to thier business) said he had only 2 girls for massage and one was busy. as i sat in the intro cubicle i noticed the "massage menu" which stated with the $250 90 minute service the spa was at the conclusion rather than at midas where it serves as "getting to know each other time" prior to massage. mina poked her nose in to barely say her name before disappearing -tiny, slim and attractive but didn't seem too cheery so i said i'll pass. "the guy"  indicated that if i returned later there would be a wider choice.

i returned 90  minutes later to be greeted by a mamsan who said 1 massage girl available -  other busy. this time grace appears with a lovely smile and reminded me of someone who unfortunately who has unfortunately returned to korea. other details - grace is approx 160 cm tall, slim body, late 20's,  bcup with auburn dyed hair. she has a large tattoo with a latin phrase meaning " i have a good life" on the right hand side of her lower back. all in all, a sleek package-only minus limited english which was unfortunate as i was able to ascertain from our limited exchanges  a lively personality.

grace lead me through a maze of corridors to our room located downstairs. the room was certainly impressive in its kitsch and luxurious style - the room's theme was  "roman empire" -two life size centurion to view the proceedings and a very inviting "ancient roman" blue tiled spa in one corner. room also included two beds, massage table and a dvd player on the wall.

proceedings kick off with grace giving me a wash down with only a short squeeze down there. onto the massage table and grace gives me a whole body massage revealing quite strong hands. she goes to her bag of tricks and i know whats coming - i say i'll skip the facial. now the fun starts  as i feel her oiled up breasts at my feet-up my body she comes swirling her breasts and then another run-she certainly is dexterous.

the front gets just as good a going over - then she oils up again and gives my cock its own  frantic breast massage. i didn't need much encouragement to blow - but she made sure i pumped it all out with plenty of tight ball squeezing as she tugged away.

grace was certainly the best i have had from "jasmines" -   i had visited twice before at thier previous address.

i've seen mina before - super hot - amazing strong proper massage - a bit mechanical though like lots of korean wgs. Not a good place to go for a massage because if people see you come in or out they'll assume you want fs as it's always been one of sydney's most infamous brothels

Hey AG,

Would it be possible for your to utilise the review template to write a review of Mina?

There is not much to go by in your "review" and as we has as yet had many reviews here it would be of most appeal if you did so that others can decide to visit.

Fair point, sorry - but i haven't seen her at eternity, only at jasmine's about 6-8 months ago... i went to eternity once and it was pretty good if you don't mind walking into a very wellknown brothel. i'll make sure i write a full review using the template if i ever go back - but i probbably won't because it seems very public!

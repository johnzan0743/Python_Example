Level 2 16 Campbell st haymarket near chat thai - Contact Soon Tree Thai Massage

this is easy to miss walking pass as its on upper floor with no signage. Its an office space with curtains but they have done a nice job its a very welcoming space.

I paid around $50 for 1 hr oil massage which ended up being delivered by a 50 something Thai woman who couldnt speak much english. She was pretty good though nowhere near standard of the good people at nearby shops like arom

big sign on counter said non sexual service and thats what it proved to be!! I liked the place and its quiet and cheap -'but there are better shops nearby for a straight massage like Arom or dragonfly or that sydney city massage spa place nr snowlotus.

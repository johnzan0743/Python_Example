Establishment and/or person's Name: Therapeutic Massage Centre, Linda (no, not the famous and very good Linda who no longer works here)

Contact Details/Address: Room 3, 2nd floor, 215 A Thomas Street, Chinatown Sydney - 9282 9130. On a dodgy-looking floor that's up one dodgy-looking flight of stairs from a manga comic store.

Prices: $30/30m, $45/45, $60/60m, $90/90m (massage only, tug extra)

Age: 40's?

Size/shape: Padded

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Massage, plus 'happy ending' and titplay for extra $20

Value for money/recommend ? No, won't go back, at least not to see her

I'm a long-time fan of Linda who works at this shop, but on this visit I met a different Linda - a shame, as when I called ahead I was assured Linda was working and thought 'Excellent!'.

But  this Linda is not very attractive, being short and pudgy, and has almost no English - unlike 'my' Linda, who is a bit taller and average in build, excellent English and a cheeky attitude (along with those famous little A cups with incredibly long nipples which extend like doorstops).

Decided to try for one hour anyway. Rooms are very small and cramped, and with the heater-fan on full bore it was actually too warm, even wearing nothing!

Linda's massage is very average, and not one to go back for. One word of English she does know is 'Nice' because every five minutes she would ask me "Nice?" to which I would respond with a non-committal groan. Did not stop her asking every five minutes, even during the tug. I stopped counting after the 10th "Nice".

Tug was very workmanlike, no foreplay, just "Turn over", on with the oil and on with the show.

Finished the tug, paid her the $20 agreed on earlier. Won't be back and suggest no-one else visit either, especially not if you are hoping to see THE Linda.

Under recommendation, tried a place in Haymarket Sydney (china town)
217a Thomas st Haymarket across the road from Market City,

You could very easily miss the entrance alongside a fruit shop 
You keep going up the stairs to the top past the internet cafe which shares the same stairwell

two ML's were on duty.
both Asian approximately 40 or so years old.

opening hours are business hours closing around 7pm depending.

asked the price, seems to be a industry standard
$35 1/5hr + $20 extra for HR
all up cost $55 paid upfront.

ML name Julia
age 40+ (probably someones mother)
slim figure, attractive face, B cup breasts
Spoke English relatively well (guessing she has been in aus for a long time)
Julia Roster (Tuesday's and Thursday's only)
Good mature massage, you can tell she has done this for many years possibly a remedial therapist.
HR a bit rough and hurried technique a little amateurish.

Seemed genuinely happy to please.
No showers, small rooms
Red celophane over a flouro light to add mood

clean sheet on the table but spartan decor and furnishings
all up a relatively cheap experience.

I may return for the massage.

I hope this is useful to someone.

Cescy: "not bad and cheap" is a decent 'executive summary' of this place! Bit of a dive, and it's bloody hot in summer, but if you get the right lady (try for the original Linda, who I believe is now back a few days a week) it can be very good. Showers would be nice though. But hey, if you get Linda you'll get a good massage and happy ending, then you can head into the Dixon St mall for dinner. Nice evening all up!

My experience/comments: I have been going to this place for many years. Julia is the owner and offers a great strong remedial massage with a happy ending. She really knows her way round my body and gets all the knots out. Afterwards there is the ass play and tug which is intense and dirty and she really gets into it with firm a grip and lots of oil. i always finish with neck and head massage which leaves you feeling lighter than air. I have tried the other women there, they give great remedial massage but lack in the sexy part. But you never know , may get a Julia protege to keep me happy when she is not on. Will be going there for many years to come.

Date of Visit: 27/04/11

Contact Details/Address/Weblink:215A Thomas St, Haymarket

Hours of Business: 

Rates: $35/half massage + $15 for HJ

Age: Hard to tell - late 30's - early 40's?

Size/shape: Slim, taller than usual for an asian masseuse

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided: Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend?: Yes, I'd go back

My experience/comments: 

Was getting a bit stressed at work, and thought I'd visit. It had been quite a long time since I was here last. The only girl there was Anna. 

Anna can converse in English quite well, which is always a plus for me. She gave a very good massage and you can tell she has been trained well. The massage seemed to go forever, and I was really quite relaxed. I was thinking I'd be happy just to have the massage and if she didnt upsell, then that would be fine. But then the light touching started, and she then moved down to the tackle tickle. She has a very good technique and I could have let that go for longer.

Anna asked to flip over, and asked if I wanted a HJ. Of course! Then she said it's extra, and that it's up to me how much I paid. I had already given her a $50 so I suggested she keep the change and she was fine with that. She has a very good technique with the HJ, using her fingertips to sort of lightly twist and play with little big monty's head. Feeling her up over her clothes is fine, however she did let me play with her boobs inside her bra. I eventually unloaded, and she then continued with the massage on my front.

At the end, she cleaned me up with a warm towel and I was on my way. I was there for at least 45 mins, so she's no clock watcher.

So for $50 all up, it's pretty good value.

Rates : I took the 45min/$50 option + $20 ($70 all up)

Age : 40's?

Size/shape : Pretty slim body with what seemed like a firm body for someone her age

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided :  Awesome massage with soft tease then HJ to finish

Value for money/recommend? : Absolutely

My experience/comments:
Wow, it's been a long time since someone has posted here.
Well, I myself hadn't been there in a few years but 2 weeks ago I had to go to the city to do some things. I rang up to see if Julia was working and was told that she was. I turned up at around 3pm-ish and was greeted by the lovely Julia. I used to go regularly but I have had Julia a few times in the past. She said she vaguely remembered me but i wasnt sure if she was just saying it :/
Was asked how long i wanted, and i asked for the 45 min. She informed me that 45 mins would be $50 so as I handed her the $50 note i also handed her a $20 to go with it so that she knew i wanted everything massaged. Was asked to strip and lay on the table.
She asked me how i wanted my massage and proceeded to give me one of the best massages i have had in a long time. Her English is quite good so we had a bit of idle chit chat and sometimes i would be silent and enjoy my massage. 
As the massage went on, i would get a few brushes downstairs but overall the massage felt really good. SHe got out a lot of kinks. After an awesome massage she started with the slow teasing touches with her fingertips and she had me almost going crazy with her teasing light touches. WHen it was time to turn over she had me at full attention as she oiled me up and gave me the perfect handjob if there ever was one. As she stroked away, my hand wandered a bit and i asked if it was ok to do some light touching through her clothes which she said was ok. FInally he had me shaking with a shattering orgasm. She kept stroking softly as I finished off and i was felt pretty light headed and tingly on the bench. SHe cleaned me up as i relaxed and finished off with a light head massage. When we were done, she left me alone to gather myself and to get dressed, but i was not rushed in any way. On the way out i thanked her and said i would be back.
Treat her with respect and she will look after you, gentlemen. From memory i think she still works Tue and Thu. Highly recommended!

Establishment :215 Thomas St

Date of Visit : on and off for years

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As above

Hours of Business : 10 until 7 but will stay longer if you make a booking

Rates : 65 for hour - I think not been for some time

Age : 40's?

Size/shape : Slim body...

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Great massage and great tug.

I have been seeing Julia or years and she always greets me with a smile. She offers a great massage and on repeat visit she knows exactly what you enjoy especially when it comes to the sensual part and tickle tackle. The tug is slow and build you up to the point of no return. I always pay Julia a visit when I am in Sydney.

I have seen some of her friends over the years but she is the best and is definately worth a visit to kill an hour. 

Value for money/recommend?  I return to visit all the time

Person's Name : Anna and Lilly

Establishment :215 Thomas St

Date of Visit : August/September 2012

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As above

Hours of Business : 10am to 7pm

Rates : $35 half, $60 hour + $20 tip for happy ending

Age : 40's

Size/shape : Milf bodies, but good shapes for Milfs

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Good massage and tug

Julia gets most of the reviews from this place and deservedly so. However a couple of the other ladies here are worth a visit.

Anna

Has been working here for a long time on and off. When I first met her the massage was good but the tug a bit mechanical. After a long hiatus I recently revisited and found she has learned a thing or two about gently starting the tackle tickle and slowly increasing the pace of the tug. Extras- definitely not (at least in my case) just the tug. Doesn't seem to mind a bit of external touching through the clothes though.

Works here most days (one day a week off, can't remember which).

Lilly

Has just started working here recently. This is the same Lilly that works at Linda's shop in Victoria St Chatswood in the old brick building near Chatswood Chase. Very good massage and tug.Works Fridays only here. Lilly seems to get a few bookings so must be doing something right.

Again I think extras are limited (although cant remember asking her recently) but seems relaxed about external touching.

As mentioned by others this shop is not the place to go for young hotties. But both ladies are in good shape for their age have friendly personalities and do a good massage and tug. Recommended especially if Julia is not there.

Establishment : Therapeutic Massage Centre

Date of Visit : 16-2-13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Room 3, Lvl 2, 215A Thomas St, Haymarket - 02 9282 9130

Hours of Business : 10:00-19:00 / Kerry work Wednesday & Saturday

Rates : $60 for the hour

Age : late 40's / early 50's

Size/shape : size 12, plumpier…middle-aged average housewife look 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : therapeutic massage

Value for money/recommend? : good, firm massage / hj could be good

My experience/comments :  All this tourist walking about meant my legs were sore so another massage was needed. I'd been to this place many years before when Linda was on. The stairway looked slightly better and not as shonky than I remember it…wait, doesn't it usually work the other way around? Got in the shop and Kerry ushered me in. Massage got going and I just slowly dozed off as I usually do in a session. I found Kerry's technique to be firm and skilful but her massage on my legs could've used a little more pressure. It was a good massage although not as good as the one I got from No No at Sunflower the day previous. As the massage was wrapping up, Kerry's hands started that light teasing dance which I found pleasurable. On the turn-over, deft hands got to playing with my member but alas had to turn down her offer for a happy ending. I was very tempted to try her technique out but I wanted to save my load for a visit to 12 Bellevue straight afterwards. Oh well, maybe another time. Kerry continued to massage my front until the session finished. Decent massage and potentially good tease/hj. If only I wasn't so greedy for a FS.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :
It looks like nobody has been here for years!! I know i hadn't been here for a long time but i was out and about in the city and had a pretty busy weekend so i thought i would drop by this old haunt to see how they were doing 

Was greeted a the door by someone i would later get to know as Anna. Asked how long and said half hour so paid my $35 and stripped down.

Massage was really good and we made a bit of small and idle chit chat. I usually like to get to chat but today i was a bit tired as i had a busy weekend so i just lay back and closed my eyes and enjoyed the massage. 

The massage was awesome and relaxing. Before i knew it my half hour was pretty much up. Now here is the strange thing... When she finished massaging my legs there was no tickle tackle or slow butterfly touches... She simply finished and said "ok, all done" and walked out. I woke up in my daze (i had been relaxing and enjoying the massage) and thought "uh oh..." 

I stuck my head out the door where she was waiting and i mouthed "sorry, any chance of hand relief?"

It was really quiet and she said "yes no problem." She came back into the room and i apologized for asking and she said with a smile "no worries, we do that here. Just ask next time because not everyone is here for a tug."

So i lay back face down as she lightly brushed her hands against my back and legs and started with the butterfly touches. Turn over time and i was standing to full attention. She oiled up and gave me a nice sensual HJ which i really enjoyed. Now i like the slow and soft tug and she obliged. Some light touching over clothes was permitted but i thought i would keep it respectful and kept it to just putting my arms around her waist as she tugged. After a few more strokes i was nearing the edge so i let her know. As the pressure built up i held on to her tighter as i erupted all over the place!

I relaxed a bit and gathered myself as she cleaned me up. She told me to take my time as she left the room to let me regather myself. After i got dressed i walked out and handed her the stock standard $20 tip and thanked her for an awesome massage.

I hadn't been here for a long time as i had been venturing out and trying some new places. But this looks like one of the hidden gems for me. The girls aren't hot but if you are after a good massage with a nice tug then this is the place for you. I will definitely be returning

Value for money/recommend? : yes

Experience Comments:
I can’t believe this place is still going. It’s been years since I’ve been here last so it was surprise that I decided to drop by today. The trip up the stairway is still as grubby as I remember but with the added bonus of a cctv camera towards the top floor. As I entered, I was greeted by a fairly hot, short-haired MILF but alas she was already with a costumer as I had to wait in the other room for another girl. Not long after, Sasa arrived and with some chit-chat and financials sorted she proceeded to give me a good firm massage. I found Sasa to be very friendly and welcoming and while her technique wasn’t the best I’ve experienced, I found it very adequate and relaxing.   The tease came in the form of her bare leg in between mine and some light accidental touches. As the final round approached, I opted for nude finish and despite her age, Sasa was in good shape and I had a play and nibble on her nips as she stroked me. Alas, no DATY was offered this time but I finished happy and satisfied. I’d definitely recommend her or better yet I’m curious about the first girl I encountered.

This place was boarded up last week because of the works outside. Didn't look like it would be reopening.

Does any one know where Julia is working now? She did say she was looking for a new shops, perhaps in Hornsby?

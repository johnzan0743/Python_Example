My experience/comments : 

Was walking along Liverpool st near the corner of George st and saw a massage sign on the street, had a tough day at work so I decided that I would TOFTT.

Walked up the steep stairs to find a lone Chinese lady sitting at a desk. Ask about the prices and took the 1 hr massage option. There are 3 massage rooms here with walls but they don't go up to the roof. Got the clothes off and lay down to await for my massage in anticipation.

The lady comes back and does not an eyelid when she sees my naked ass. She just starts her handiwork and I can soon tell that she is a master at massage. As each minute of massage goes on my hopes of any extras are declining more and more. She is a very polite lady with fair english but she does not talk much, just gets on with her skill.

I did have a sore shoulder so this massage was helping to work the knots and pain away. She focused on my upper body for the first half hour mixed with some nice head massage and some leg stretching.

Upon the turnover she put a pillow under my head and put a little towel to cover the bits. Some more nice head massage and some arm stretching ensued and then she bent my legs up and across and that little towel fell of me and slipped on to the floor. She didn't say anything, just bending down to pick it up and put it in its place again.

The hour is up and I am actually glad that I tried this place as it was a very enjoyable massage although there was no extras asked for or offered. I guess the name of this place was a big hint that it is pretty legit. Oh well, at least I got a receipt to get a few dollars back from the Health fund.

My experience/comments : I thought i'd try a new place. This place is just near Redfern oval and has bright purple signage etc.
It seems to have about 4 rooms, curtains for doors and the walls don't quite go to the ceiling, so not sound-proof.

 I walked in, and thought I recognised the massage therapist, wasn't 100% sure but as soon as she started massaging me I knew i'd seen her before. At Aray's massage, like 2 days before.


Funny enough, the massage was pretty much the same. Not my style, kind of boring but practical. No real tickle of the tackle until the flip.
The usual stuff happened and I got a clean-up.
I don't particularly like her massage style, and I don't find her attractive at all, so for me this was a fail, however I shouldn't write the shop off yet.

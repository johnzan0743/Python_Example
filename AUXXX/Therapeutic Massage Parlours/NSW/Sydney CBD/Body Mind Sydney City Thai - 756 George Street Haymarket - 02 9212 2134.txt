My experience:This place is up the stairs on the first level, do not go to the one on Level 2 it is legit. Now I have had 2 massages at this establishment and both have been very very good Thai massages. So I would return just for the massage. The bonus is that the girls do offer the old hj at the end. Now with a few of the girls I'm sure more is on offer for the right price. My massage with Katie was nice and therapeutic however being a fairly normal Thai massage place I wasn't able to pick my massuse and Katie is a very slim size 6 A breast and no ass,  not my type. Great personality though. Her massage was very good, but her Part 2 was fairly average, however she was willing to please. The price negotiation was fairly expensive and I don't really like haggling so I went with 40 for the hj as the massage had been very good. All in all I will be back to see one of the other girls.

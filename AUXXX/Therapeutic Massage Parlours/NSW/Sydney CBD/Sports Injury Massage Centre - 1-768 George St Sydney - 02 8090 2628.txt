Hours of Business: 7 days - 10am to 11pm (according to their business card but they usually close 9 or 10pm)

Rates: $35/$60 30/60 mins

Age: 20's

Size/shape: It was a bloke, so as far as I'm concerned this is N/A...

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided: Massage only (well maybe he does offer extras...I definitely didn't ask!!)

Value for money/recommend?: If you need a good legit massage, yes.

My experience/comments: 1st spotted this place probably 4 or 5 months ago. As it advertises being open very late, I suspected it might offer extras. Did try going here a couple of time over the last few months, but each time it had closed earlier than the advertised time.

So I thought I would try again and see what was on offer. Was greeted by a papasan who explained the prices and asked how long I would like. Opted for the 30 mins option. He directed me to a room and advised someone would be with me in a moment.

The bad news was as soon as I got to the room a young guy appeared who was going to do the massage. The good news was that I hadn't stripped off yet, as I would have found it rather uncomfortable if I had stripped off all my clothes and then a bloke turned up. Needless to say the pants stayed on as I got onto the massage table.

Anyway, this guy did provide a very good massage. Sorted out my tight lower back, so if you do have some serious knots you need fixed then this may be worth a visit. If you are looking for extras...well I suppose you can always ask!

Cheers,

BAB

Methinks this will not be a place where I will be asking for extras - or even be in a position to do so. Thanks for the report.

Services Provided : waxing and beauty services 

Value for money/recommend? : Excellent value for money in clean relaxed environment and no double dipping

My experience/comments :Made an appointment to see my waxing lady during the week for Saturday morning. I arrived and was taken to the back room of the hair salon which is used for waxing and beauty treatments. Flora is a qualified beautician and is dressed in black pants and white shirt.. The room is adequate with a clean fresh feel to it with a disposable sheet on the waxing table. I strip and Flora starts her craft by playing some relaxing music and wearing her disposable gloves and starts waxing by applying hot wax to small sections of my frontal region and removing the wax and massaging the waxed area. This continues until she completely removes all the hairs from the front and sac then starts on my crack which I have to turn over for. When all the waxing is finished she gets her tweezers to work to complete the job. A soothing lotion is applied to complete the waxing.

The waxing is not painful and is done in small sections and the waxing spatula is only used for one application .There is no double dipping which is hygienic as double dipping  introduces bacteria into the wax pot as was explained by Flora.

I personally enjoy this element of clean professional treatment without the need to worry about hygiene or any up selling. I have also found that the results are much better. 

Throught out the waxing session we engage in general conversation. I get charged $70 for front, sac and crack treatment

It is important to be mindful that this a professional waxing services.

I saw Flora earlier this month. There was no sexual service, but in my opinion, it is hard to find a decent Brazilian waxer in Sydney these days - Flora is the exception.

She was great for these reasons: 
- Flora knows how to have a laugh, as opposed to being a stuck-up woman ripping you off (we are the ones doing them the favour by paying $70 for a wax).
- Her technique is clean and she does not double-dip.
- She is on time with her appointments.
- The wax was good (i.e., she didn't leave stray hairs).

Price = $70 for back, crack, and sack.

10/10.

Many thanks, awaw! :-) That's exactly what I'm looking for. Someone who just does a great Brazilian (there are many 'strictly legit' salons out there that do a poor job).

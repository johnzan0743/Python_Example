Good thing we all don't operate like that, nobody would see anybody, no one would write reviews and the site would die.

The only reason i wouldn't go there without reading the reviews is cuz its too expensive for me . If its within my budget i always go and experiment it and write reviews, you can find that out if you look at my posts.

One review here http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f286/j...5-505-a-29889/ of a place that may be associated with it.

Advanced Search for (Search Titles Only) Nuru will find a few others in the newby forum (unacceptable reviews).

Any massage done on a massage table can not be called nuru !

Just me, it just has to be done on a wet mattress on the floor - that's the minimum requirement !

I had one in Germany about 18 months ago (pretty sure I reviewed it) It was done on a covered mattress on the floor. 
One word...Awesome.

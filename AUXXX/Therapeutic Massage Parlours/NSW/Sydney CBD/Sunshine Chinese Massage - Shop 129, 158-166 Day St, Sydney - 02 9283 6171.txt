Sunshine Chinese massage
7 days 10am to 10pm
Shop 129, 158-166 Day street, Sydney
Ph: 9283 6171

I walked past this shop on a Sunday three doors down from the city central police station near Chinatown. Popped in to grab a business card and decided to try it out a few days later. Mamasan appears to be the same lady from the shop of the same name on Archer street in Chatswood.

The fitout is new with clean private rooms. Two rates listed on the wall standard or "special" massage. Took the $85 for 30min option with Lily a pleasant Chinese MILF in her 30s (I think). Massage better than average before finishing things off in the buff. I was just looking to relax with a bit of pampering so overall the experience was ok. I will probably go back.

Thanks for that gyrscope. I was wondering when someone was going to review this place. Have walked past here as well when it just opened, but am almost never in that neighborhood so haven't been able to pay them a visit. $85 for 30 mins seems rather steep pricing?

Decided to try this place out today.

Went for a 1/2 hour massage for $35.

Cindy was the ML who attended to me. Whilst she wasn't unattractive, her looks were not what I would usually consider attractive. She would have been late 20's, medium height and of a slim build. Didn't get to see her breasts, but I would guess they were A cups, but with the help of her bra were made to look bigger.

Started off on an encouraging note when she returned with my change from $50 - she stroked my chest claiming I was a beautiful man. Well, if you knew what I looked like you would know she was just trying to soften me up. Then again, maybe I am being a little harsh on myself....I digress...

First 10 mins I received a reasonable massage to my back and shoulders, followed by a light massage of the back of my legs. Then she asked me to turnover...this is when things got interesting...not in what I would call a particularly good sense.

She started giving little BAB some gentle attention. Then she asked if I would like a good time. When I asked what this involved she motioned a BJ, fingering my arse, and siad she would remove her clothes as well. All this for an additional $100!! I declined. She persisted telling me what a good time I would have and that she would really look after me. Over the next few minutes of her trying to upsell me the price went from $100, to $80, to $60, and then finally to $50. Throughout this exchange I asked her how much just for a HJ but she would just revert back to her attempt to upsell me as much as she could. She finally got the message that a HJ was all I was after (even though by this stage little BAB was getting disinterested), and offered to do it for $40, which then came down to $30, and finally we sttled on $20.

The next 5 or so minutes Cindy gave me a reasonably good HJ, and did allow touching whilst she remained clothed. At the 20 minute mark I was done...and so was Cindy. So for those that dislike being short-changed timewise then avoid this ML.

All in all I won't hurry back. When I want a HJ I don't want to be hassled by a ML for extras I clearly do not want. Add to this a so so massage, and getting shuffled out 10 mins before time is up. For my money there is better options out there.

Cheers,

BAB

Thanks for the review BAB. 

Seems like most of your time there was wasted trying to get the price down...? Sounds pretty hopeless to me.

I should have read the reviews. Dropped in here, saw Niwa (MILF, spelling?). Good figure, but thats about it. No enthusiasm, bad English, and kept calling me daaaahhhling. Massage was distinctly average. Kept trying to get sixty out of me for extras, gave 40- what a waste. Minimal touching of her allowed, was touching little Doctor up and down and nothing else. Was watching the clock, what a turn off. Did not come, nor will I come back.

Should have played it safe and gone the half hour. Now poorer and much less happy, but just as toey.

Mind you, the reception girl would have been nice.

One hour was sixty. Shortchanged on time, unhappy.

I called in here when it first opened and was shown a price list. Can't remember exactly but I think there were two tiers both above the going rate for an asian rnt. I think one tier was massage only and the other was for 'special'. No way was I going to pay around $90 I think it was for an hour massage including hj then have the ml hit you up for extras on top of that.

From what I've heard the new place in Market St is similar pricing. Must be counting on businessmen to be their customers.

Chinese Massage
Shop 129, 158-166 Day Street Sydney NSW
9283 6171

How do you get there?
If you’re traveling by train I suggest you get off at Town hall Station and head West down Bathurst Street till you get to Day Street, turn left before getting to darling Harbour. Day Street doesn’t have proper street frontage, looks like a small park in front of the shop with trees.

What was the place like?
Very nice décor and glass front doors, nice reception area, very legitimate looking.
Reasonable sized rooms accessed on the left, very clean, fresh and inviting.  Quality Fit-out looks brand new and decent money spent.

How did it all happen?
I had Saturday lunch at Haymarket and seeing all the hot asian girls I thought I would try my luck at this seemingly legit place.  Walked straight in, front door is a bit confusing, the right door only opens?? Asked if any young girl was available for massage? The manager said yes and started her standard pitch quoting $120 for 1 hr essential blah!! Blah!!! oil massage blahh!!! 
I said “I just want a young girl to give me a very basic no oil massage for ½ hour, how much?”

She reluctantly replied “girl can do for you 35dalla ok?”
Ok it was! I was ushered into the room and instructed to disrobe.
A few minutes later in walks Monika. 


Were there other girls there?
I only saw an older manager, but I could hear muffled girls voices so I suspect others work here. 

What about the girl?
A nice looking Thai girl, she said she was Japanese and 26 years old, I found it hard to believe as she didn’t look Japanese at all and her English pronunciation sounded nothing like Japanese, probably Thai, or even Chinese. I said “what a shame, I wanted a Thai girl”
“Me Thailand, no Japan! only say many customa like to hear Japan girl massage”
Larger girl but not overly fat, looked like she was in her early 30’s very smooth white skin, shoulder length black hair with a slight tinge of orange. Thicker lower body, ‘a’ or maybe ‘b’ cup maximum wearing loose shorts and baggy top.   


What was her name?
She introduced herself uneasily as Monika, mmm!!  

What days does she work?
She said she lives in the Northern suburbs and sometimes works at the sister shop in Chatswood as it is much easier for her to get to, and is only filling in for someone who called in sick at this shop and had just arrived 20 minutes before I walked in so I was her first customer for the day. 

What was provided?
I already had $20 out and waiting, said I was really only here for a HJ and not overly interested in the massage. She wouldn’t remove any clothing but gave a very good mixed tempo and pressure HJ prolonging the action. With around 5 minutes to spare she hopped on the bench and wrapped the back of here knee around my tool, AHHHHHHH!!!!!!It is no surprise what happened after pumping away at the this smooth slippery fold of skin.  After shooting over her leg she increased and prolonged the pressure on the head.   

Quality?
Very long concentrated strokes, soft then hard, varied tempo, just when she could feel I was about to shoot she would back off, and the knee action, what can I say.
she said “you ok!, I thought you die!” I thought I did too.

Price?
This was a ½ hour quality HJ in a very clean relaxing environment for $55 total spend, this is very good value provided you don’t fall for the initial up-sell of aroma therapy etc etc.. 

Any extras available?
This girl was only willing to do HJ, the back of knee milking was totally unexpected and very appreciated.

Cleanup?
Tissues then a moist wipe.

Would you go back?
Why not, cheap price, clean shop, friendly obliging girl.

I hope this review proves useful for my fellow punters.

Went in a couple of weeks ago and Casey (mid-30's) greeted me with a cheeky smile and a nice tight dress with plenty of cleavage 

Quite chatty and venue looks newly renovated and quite tastefully decorated.

Casey ushered me into the 1st room in order to explain the prices ranging from $35/30mins through to infinity (printed on a card on the wall)

It looked like there were at least 6-8 rooms

1/2 hr  $35 or special half hour for $85 . Not 100% sure but think this was for a handy andy plus birthday suit

Gut feeling was reasonable so gave the 30min std. massage a spin as can always upgrade (did see a review some time ago which was average so was a bit dubious)

Casey was really chatty and indications were good but her massage technique was poor. It resembled wiping down the kitchen bench after cooking

She tried to upgrade at the 20min mark but the massage was so poor it just wasn't going to happen.

Massage 3/10
Cleavage 8/10

Overall  5/10 at best

A real shame as the shop is really nice but something just didn't ring true.

Also saw a young anemic looking ML on the way out who looked like she didn't want to be there.

Recommendation: Don't bother but could be a gem if it changes hands as it will struggle to survive in it's current form.

Chinese Massage
Shop 129, 158-166 Day Street Sydney NSW
9283 6171

How do you get there?
Please refer to my September 2011 review for directions
directly opposite the new Commonwealth bank building at Darling Harbour.

Not as discrete as it was for my last visit, as there is a lot more activity in the area. Sorry if you shy easily 

What was the place like?
Still very nice décor, please refer to my September 2011 review
Legit place, glass front doors, there is an orange illuminated sign above the footpath.


How did it all happen?
I was walking up from Haymarket Friday afternoon and was feeling rather horny with all the hot asian girls around.  Was on my way to townhall to meet someone for a drink in the new Darling Quarter. I was early & had some spare time, since I haven't been to this shop in a long time I thought I'd check it out. 
Walked straight in (use the right hand glass door only) remembered from last time.I said I have been here before and know how it works, then I walked into the first room, disrobed & waited.

A few minutes later in walks Jeni she pronounced it JEYNNEEEE.


Were there other girls there?
Not sure, the place was very quiet and not busy at all.

What about the girl?
A nice looking asian girl, she said she was Chinese and 23 years old, I suspect she may have been a few years older, late 20's at the most.

Short, larger plump type girl maybe size 12, not fat, but definatley not your typical impish asian.
Nice smooth white skin, shoulder length black hair held up with a clip. very round 'b' or 'c' cup but would not remove her clothes, so may be wearing a padded bra.

Short, and a little stocky, wearing black clothes similar to a cafe uniform and a large loose apron covering the front.

What was her name?
Jeni she pronounced it JEYNNEEEE


What was provided & Quality??
A quick reasonable massage to get stared, and a very thourough enjoyable HJ to finish. I was a little shocked, as I was erupting she let go and gave a series of quick very unexpected dick slaps with her open palm and "said you very naughty" and giggled, I just laughed.


Price?
I already had the correct money ready, I handed her $35 and said "for your boss", then handed her a $20 note, and said for you, don't worry too much about the massage, I'm here for HJ.

This was a ½ hour quality HJ in a very clean relaxing environment for $55 total spend, the same as my previous visit.

Any extras available?
This girl was only willing to do HJ.

Cleanup?
Tissues then a moist wipe.

Would you go back?
I probably wouldn't make a special trip, but if I was in the area again, Why not! cheap price, clean shop, friendly obliging girl.

I hope this review proves useful for my fellow punters.

Shop 129, 158-166 Day Street Sydney NSW
9283 6171

How do you get there?
Please refer to my reviews for directions
directly opposite the new Commonwealth bank building at Darling Harbour.

The entry is not discrete, you are in full view of passing traffic and the area is very busy with alot of activity.

What was the place like?
Still very nice décor, used the very back room this time, soft chinese meditation style music in the background with the odd bird chirping etc. 


How did it all happen?
I was catching up with my drinking buddy again as it was Friday afternoon, so thought I would duck in for half an hour and see who was in as it is on my way.  I wanted to visit the day before (thursday) but was too lazy to walk up so went to another shop on Sussex St instead. 

Same deal as before, walked straight in 1 girl of 3 pops up and ushers me into the back room, as I was following her in I was checking out her fine bum and legs. She prepared the massage bench with fresh towel etc. transaction completed, she then dimmed the left, I disrobed & waited for her return.


Were there other girls there?
As my previous experience, this is a next cab off the rank type setup, female manager sits behind the reception desk, & 2 girls sit on the lounge in the waiting area.
One of the ml's was a little younger 


What about the girl?
Very attractive elegant looking, slim & shapely asian lady, well dressed in a black cocktail dress, perfect makup and long black hair & very polite, She said she was 30 years old, but I would say closer to 40. She looks like she looks after herself very well, if you saw her walking in the street you would never guess she was a ML.  
Quite tall for an asian lady and maybe size 8,  no touching or nudity was allowed so I cant really tell her bust size, but She had very nice legs, and she walked like a model showing off her bum.
She said she is originally from Singapore and has been in Australia for several years.
She had a very fair complexion and appeared to have been groomed in a salon.
Quite friendly and easy to get along with although a little too serious for my liking, she was certainly no naughty young asian girl that we all love to visit. 

What was her name?
She said her name way Amee-Lee or perhaps Emily, she said it twice but I just couldn't grasp it from the accent, didn't want to ask again as it doesn't really matter. I was there for the HJ, the introductions were just to be polite.

What days does she work?
She was there on Friday, she said if I want to see her again, best to call first and talk to the boss.

What was provided?
$55 was the fare for a 30 minute HJ by a fully clothed ML with absolutly No touching allowed. 
On completion she seemed pretty happy and said to come see her next time and for remind her and for $80 she will give me a full nude B2B HJ for 30 minutes. 
I said why didn't you say this from the beginning, she said "I didnt know you, maybe you make hard time for me, next time i look after you more better" 

Quality?
She was very experienced and knew exactly what to do to relieve me, I happily expelled a load, but she wasn't as naughty as I would have liked.

Price?
I knew the prices from before, I paid a total of $55 in mixed notes to the ML so she could pull $20 out before giving the rest to her boss. 

Any extras available?
She suggested a $80 up-sell for B2B, on my next visit.


Cleanup?
Tissues then a moist wipe (warm towel available and shower, but I never accept).

Would you go back?
I have been back, and will return again to this spotless shop that treats it's customers like royalty


I hope this review proves useful for my fellow punters.

Went there again a few Sunday's ago. Wasn't a good experience really. The woman was busty but plump. Didn't get any choice. I think it was like $85 for a half hour, didn't feel like was worth it. The space is nice so I guess if you get a great girl its worth it but I haven't in 3 or 4 visits so never again. The one down the road next to the police stn has younger and better gilrs if you are brave.

Went here a few weeks ago as well. Ladies walking around were definitely older than the ones down the road at the other joint on Day St. Can't remember price but the women kept trying to upsell everytime- ended up doing CBJ for $45 but just couldn't finish.

Date of Visit : 28 May 2013 

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 02 9283 6171 address as per heading 

Hours of Business : 10am onwards 

Rates : $40 / half hour,  $70 / hour
              $120 / hour the works,  aromatic oil,  HJ,  B2B


Age : mid to late 20's

Size/shape : 165cm, 50kg, cute butt,  32B

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean 

Services Provided : Massage, B2B (no oil) & HJ

Value for money/recommend? : YES

My experience/comments :

Sunshine Chinese Massage is just a short stroll from Dixon St,  Chinatown.  You have to walk past another massage place which is right next to a  Police station before you get to this place.  Very exposed and a stream of people strolling by.   The inside is very clean and warm no showers offered before or after.   The Mamasan said not needed as you are wiped down with hot towels. 

I rang asking if I can book Emily or Amy (as reviewed earlier)  The Mamasan (didn't catch her name)  said she had moved on but had someone as nice as her ( similar age looks) or had a young 18yo Korean gal who is new.   I turned up and was shown the room by the Mamasan,  an attractive MILF I flirted with her that I wouldn't mind her giving me the massage but all I got was a Mona Lisa smile. 

I settled for the hour message with the works and was met by the young Korean as described.  Young looking but older than 18 wearing a white hot pants style outfit.  Her English is not that good though and had some funny gestures eg tapping me rapidly on the side of the butt which I thought meant to turn over but she said No.  I still don't know what she meant lol

In summary the massage was great,  she used her elbows to great effect in getting some kinks out of my back,  the body to body was sensual (as opposed to a bodyslide which uses oil as the lubricant between the bodies) and the HJ was good and got me over the line.  Finished off my time with a head and shoulder massage.  Doris was trimmed. 

Overall had an enjoyable time and braced myself for the walk of shame as I opened the door to leave.

Haha was sitting in mu hotel room doing the review via my tablet and it is a pain to edit any large amount of forum text.  I realised I had forgotten the foliage description so just added it in as an after thought.  Doris also only works on Tuesday, Friday and Sundays.

Value for money/recommend? : City Style

My experience/comments :

I went and saw Tiffany, she speaks well English. I was ushered into a room and the room was pretty good with high massage tables and good lighting. The massage I chose was for 1 hour and paid my $60. The massage was quite well and she perfectly hit the sore spots. She was not a pro as u can say but she did try her best. As the half hour mark came, my hands to start get naughty and by the mean time was grabbing her ass cheeks. She started to respond to my activeness and started teasing my balls and my lil brother.

I asked her for extras and she prompted it would be $20 for HJ and $50 for nude HJ. Since, my balls were full and needed to be emptied, I went for the Nude HJ option. In a jiffy, the clothes were off. I would say she was arnd 34C to be quite honest and would sit perfectly on my hands. Her part two i.e. HJ was quite moderate and her she seemed to have been really eager to let my balls dry. And without any further a due i came.She provided with me hot towels and wiped of the mess.

I would definitely be back to check out more girls from this place. The place is quite far from the bustling city streets and very quiet and hidden place.

Thats my first review in this site....Hope i did good....

Value for money/recommend? : OK

My experience/comments :

Thought Id give this place a go instead of the one near the police station.

Was told I could go either $35 for 30 min & negotiate extras with girl or pay $85 up front & id get nude body slide + hj, so went with the $85.

Was introduced to Lily, nice tall in great dress.

Rooms are nice, I got nude laid face down & lily started with the massage clothed.  Nice massage, no great touching of the butt, then she went & got a towel to rub all the oil off.

Then she took all her clothes off & began a body slide while I was face down, plenty of rubbing of her tits over my bum, then turn over.

She began the hj, standing beside me, I asked her to sit on me while she worked on the hj.  Was great trying to kiss her nice bum.

Finally blew, she cleaned me up & then it was time to go.

She wasn't big on touching but didnt mind kissing her but.

Not bad, I wonder what down the road is like.

 Sunshine massage CBD - Lilly
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Lilly

Establishment : shop129 / 158 Day street sydney

Date of Visit : last week

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 02 9283 6171

Hours of Business : 10am -10pm

Rates : $40/30min + 20 hj

Age : prob mid 20s

Size/shape : 8 may be

Nationality or Ethnicity : chinese

Services Provided : Massage + hj

Value for money/recommend? : yes for part 1 no no no for part 2

My experience/comments : ok, after my first dissapointing session at this joint with Doris, thought I might give it a second chance given this place opens till late and nice room indeed. Went in at 9pm one day last week without booking, mamasan yelled out Lilly, young girl but nothing special, thought she might make it up with her skills, hell I was wrong. 
So in room and sorted for financial for 30 min session, off she went and I stripped naked face down waiting for her return. Massage started, her massage skills was above average but without teasing, I'd like someone who can massage and will lead you into part 2 which you couldn't refuse( which means your already rock hard while facing down). The MLs(mostly younger one) I had recently didn't have these skills which makes me feel upset visiting massage parlours. At 20mins mark, it was turnover time with my flaccid fella, offered HJ and nude HJ, opted for HJ only as I can't see nothing under the dress (boobless lol). Was hoping that she could give a good hj if not decent given that she wasn't stunning at all (sorry may be it just for me if you disagree). When she straight away to get some oil from the table, I was regret already, could I say No Thanks at the time before she touches my old fella? Any bro? She had absolutely no idea what she was doing, put a lot of oil on my buddy before he went rock hard, the feeling was so awful and discomfort, anyhow I closed my eyes and let it be, eventually I managed to unload and dressed up and left immediately after paying $20tips. Tbh, it was the worst hj I've ever had, I could've done it better with my left hand( I am a righty anyway). I'll now write off this place for sure.

When I left and headed to Chinatown direction,  I noticed there was another joint just opposite the police station, at the corner, any bro tried that shop and mind to share?

Hi brother greenl,

That's two punts in a row that you had poor HJ from this shop I think that's enough, there are at least 6 other shops in the CBD area and I can name 20 girls who are tested and proven, why take risks ??

Better luck next time - probably not at Sunshine again...........lol

Cheers

Haha ahlungor, I know, but sometimes I just wanna try some fresh face and see if I can discover some hidden gem lol. So I just TOFTT I guess. Still being a regular at SL but no one fancies me at the moment, Mena is off the roster today I just noticed do you have any idea?  Anyway I just been to CBD Posh last week(check my review) will be going again to test drive another pretty ML. Not really sure what's her name but will find out, since that day only had 2 girls on their roster, so I guess she was the other one. Cheers

When I walked in the city I wanted to relax a little bit and walked in. 

I went for the hour oil massage and lay down on the bed. 

Apple started with my back slowly massage and gentle and during the massage after she done my legs and back and arms, she slowly was teasing me.

She undressed herself and placed more oil on me and herself and she slided on my back with her nice breast I think c cup. 
also kissing my ear softly 

Her hand touched me by accident and she saw I was enjoying that so she slowly started to massage me around that area.
Little teasing and sometimes move away from there and then back, finally she asked me to turn on the table

then she also was sliding over me and teasing me by slide her pussy near my cock, but she would not go further, and then she took some more oil.
and played gentle with my cock and slided slowly but faster and faster, I played in mean time with her breast and touched her body slowly.

soon I came and I shot at the wall, he he 

after she cleaned me up, I was very relax, Apple is a very cute and polite girl. 

I would sure come back.

Rates : 30 min/ $40

Age : 20 something

Size/shape : Medium built I think (to be honest, wasn't paying much attention)

Return: Maybe.

Comments: Was working in the city today, so decided to stop by this  massage place. Didn't have much time so went for the 30 minute option.  Massage was just perfect for me, medium strength, not too hard, not too  soft. She seemed to know exactly where to press to relieve the stress.  At around halfway point, she started with the soft massage for a few  minutes, then asked me to turn over. Was feeling quite horny, so shot  quite fast. Thus the R&T part was good, though i prefer it to be a  bit more slower.

Comments:

Darker chinese skin, fairly well kept. A cheeky glint in eye and smile.

This girl is good at massage and  she  told me she  has learnt professionally before. Conversation was good. Good english.

Her part 2 is ok. Doesn't seem to be that into it, a bit fakey. But professional enough.

Don't think she is up for much more based on attitude.

Summary. Above average, pretty enough. Good massage, teetering on the brink of mechanical part 2 but good enough.

Establishment : Shop 158 - Day Street

Date of Visit :6 March

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Sunshine Massage Shop 129,158-166 Day Street 2000 Sydney
New South Wales Phone: (02) 9283 6171 Website: Sunshine Massage

Hours : 10am till 10

Rates : 30 min/$40 + tip

Review: was in the area so thought i would check this place out. was greeted by ice on arival and ushered into the room. great massage to start with with almost the entire first 15 minutes spent on my lower back, ass and upper legs with no doubt what was on offer.

Unfortunately that is when things turned south. Now this place has 3/4 height walls with and sound proof is non existent. so enter these 2 korean guys chatting to each other. they went, i assume into separate rooms as i could here them undress but they kept chatting to each other only louder. as there were no girls available for them at the time they kept chatting to each other........

ice by this stage had me flipped and was working her hardest to get me across the line but all i could here was 2 guys yelling at each other, laughing and carrying on. VERY DISTRACTING.

While Ice did her best to engage me and she did get the job done she and i were both pissed off and she was very apologetic about the noise.

So while Ice was cute i would never return for the shear noise of the place. Oh and the fact that you walk in right next to a cop shop is a bit off putting too.

Person's Name : Nancy

Establishment : shop129 / 158 Day street sydney

Date of Visit : 11/5/2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 02 9283 6171

Hours of Business : 10am -10pm

Rates : $85/30min Nude HJ

Age : 40s

Size/shape : b cuppers  - average

Nationality or Ethnicity : chinese - her English is bloody

Services Provided : Massage + topless hj

Value for money/recommend? : No way - worst punt in ages, wouldn't return, never ever

Comment:
I was up this end of town for a catch up with a mate, but he called to say something had come up. So had a bit of time to kill before returning to
work and thought there a couple of places down here where I might be able to get a punt. So went to the one near the police station - Hong Kong Massage I think - but they
were booked for around an hour - which was a shame because the girl who came out was cute.

So headed down to Sunshine and walked through door and was greeted by Nancy an average looking 40 something and said can I have a massage. Said sure young girl
will be ready shortly, so she showed me to the room and told me the rates. A fool that I am I paid over the amount for nude as she said the girl was cute - I should
know better this is a rookie mistake. Stripped and got onto the bed. The rooms are quite nice and clean with walls that go nearly to the ceiling. A minute or so
later Nancy came back in and said sorry young girl busy you will have me. In hindsight, what I should have done is got dressed and asked for my money back, but didn't
jeez what a dumb arse. 

So said OK and she started one of the most feeble excuses for a massage that I have ever had, not even soft just pathetic. One of those push massages without any real technique.
Ask for hard and she said I am and I thought fuck this is not going well. 20 minutes of this crap and the tackle tickle started with more FOAMing than 20 Porno's. If some one was listening
and who knows maybe the cops were, it would have sounded like I was banging the crap put of this woman and she was cumming in buckets. Her TT technique was pretty average. 
So turnover time and she removes her top only and says I have period - hate that to - and leaves her strides on. So she plays with my tool and at least has a bit of an idea with that
and I play and with her tits. After awhile she says you cum now as we only have a few minutes to go and ramps up the pace. Doesn't work and then she says times up and leaves.
I hadn't cum at all. No clean up, no hot towels to remove the oil off my back nothing. So I cleaned up as best I could with some tissues and wet ones I found in the draw. Got dressed and 
started to leave. Now here is a kicker - she asked for a further tip for doing a great job. I laughed and said no way and left. She said something in Chinese which I am sure was "You
tight arse bastard may your dick drop off"

For those interested in avoiding Nancy she works Mondays and Tuesdays. Me I am avoiding the whole area - far far better options.

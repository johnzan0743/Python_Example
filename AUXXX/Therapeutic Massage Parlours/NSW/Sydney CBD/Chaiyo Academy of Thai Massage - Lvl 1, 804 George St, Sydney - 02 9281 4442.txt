So we can now add Father Christmas to the list with the Tooth Fairy.

Been here a couple of times, and not even a hint of a tackle tickle. I did ask the first time, and was gently but firmly told no, so let's just focus on the massage here.

I think they are a legit massage school, both time have been awesome, and went for the oil massage as my preferred choice.
The ladies have been in their late 20's to late 30's, not unattractive, wearing traditional Thai massage baggy pants.

The rooms are light and airy, the shower in the room I have been in is cute, they have put in a pebble and sand floor to give it an asian touch.  Nice and clean but no soap!

To sum it up, a damn good massage, and at $45 for the hour, you have enough left over for a tug elsewhere, and don't have to trouble that next lady with going through any crappy massage stuff  LOL

Back again for another massage, this time I knew nothing was going to happen, I got the male masseur, and got to wear the baggy brown pants and shirt.

Got a killer massage, so hard I was aching for days, hopefully in a good way, and then needed to go elsewhere for a tug, to be reported elsewhere.

Checked out a new looking massage setup in Darlinghurst. Unfortunately l cannot recall any details of it! I just know its opposite 232 Liverpool St, Darlinghurst and its visible on Google Maps. 

Paid $30 for a 20 minute massage with expectations it would be legit. They have excellent premises with big private rooms. I had a young Thai girl called Pinky. Quite a petite frame and nice looking face.

Lay down on the large table buck naked and Pinky commenced the massage undraped. A very, very good therapeutic massage ensued with quite a lot of tickle tackle as l lay on my stomach giving me a raging erection. Just got Pinky to work my back and with 5 minutes, to go she asked if l wanted a HJ. Didn't have a cent left if my pockets so had to decline. She offered the standard rate - $50 for a nude HJ. 

Also noticed they have some feminine looking Thai dudes if your that way inclined. 

Will be back for a therapeutic rub and tug.

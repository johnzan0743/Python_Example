Level 1, 657 Botany Rd ROSEBERRY - 8061 6698 / 0431509006

Driving down Botany Rd, on the left hand side going South, I noticed the ORIENTIAL HEALING CENTRE on the 1st Level, but why is it stuck in the middle of a Male dominated Roseberry...we'll have to explore this new shop, it's midday on Wednesday, I am bored and there are 2 working days to go so up I go. It is a one (1) room with walls to the roof and (2) curtined massage rooms, the chunky Chinese Chick who greeted me has extra's written all over her, it's supposed to be the "Oriental Healing Centre" I thought they may have white jackets on but they don't....I am nude, it's warm today and I just frankly say to her do you do a H.J.....Yes she replied, then I asked her do you take your clothes of, Yes she replied for extra....I gave her $40 on top of the $60 for the massage, she looks at me, I said I would like the Nude HJ up front as a Happy Start and she strips, I suck her nipples then her pussy looked clean so I taste it, she is not pleased that I did that, I then directed the tip of my Tongue to her Clit that hit the spot but she was still not to keen on DATY, then on the Table for a upfront HJ, it is amazing that even when you do get a nude B2B as soon as you spurt the Asian chicks want to get dressed, I asked her to stay n ude which she does for the rest of the hour after heaps of back massage & tackle tickle I turned over for HJ number 2................over all just another Chinese RnT, the ML's were nothing special but it's in Roseberry, oh they have a very good shower in a clean bathroom with very hot water & pump soap, NO other sexual options are available except she did offer in the end a CBJ but I had already slimmed at the start and spent $100 so I was not going to pay her any more ...................SeaRay

My experience/comments: Walking up the stairs, I was greeted by an older-than usual Asian lady, who whisked me away into one of the massage rooms.

I asked whether we could do a "special" finish, and was told it was half hour massage with "special" for $80.

I handed across the money expecting a massage and Hand Relief, and was pleasantly surprised to have a half decent massage and upon turning over, have the masseuse remove her clothing and start to give me head...., I looked at her and asked her to mount me, and with her broken english, "you want fuck?", I nodded and she proceeded to mount me until i blew.

Not a bad service for $80, although not the prettiest of massage ladies, her body was quite good.

My experience/comments: Well you will all note this has been a regular bank for my deposits last year, and was feeling a bit toey, so thought i'd go visit the tellers at this bank. (It now feels like a bank as their rates keep rising). A Portly mamasan seats me and asks me to wait 5 minutes, and Im struggling with the thought of seeing her naked, but Suprisingly a thin, youngish looking body appears from the room and hurries me in. Now call me a tight arse, but if I had not had the extra $5 on me, it would've frustrated the shit out of me. Lucky Mrs Metriocafe has loosened the purse strings, to allow for lifes little suprises.
Anyway, after a lack lusted massage a bit of tackle tiocle begins, and the I ask her for a CBJ. She grinds her teeth on the old fella and I thought I was gonna feint. 
Pulled her up and get her to sit on me cowgirl style, and thank goodness it was a nice tight . Got me over the line with 1 minute to go. Not bad, but not the greatest experience of my life.fit

Name:  Cindy

Establishment:  Lvl 1, 657 Botany Road

Hours  :  10am -8pm

Rates:  $30/30min  $50/1hr

Age:    Upper 30's ?

Nationality:    Chinese

Shape:     Chunky

Services:  Massage  + extras

Value for Monay:   barely

Called here on a Tuesday a few weeks ago.    Rang the bell and greeted by a chunky chinese lady, who uses the name of Cindy. She looked as if extras would almost certainly be on offer.

Shown up the stairs and ushered into the nearest room.  There are at least 2 rooms.  There was another lady on but I didn't see her.

Took the 30 min option  and Cindy began a perfunctory massage, so i asked about extras on offer were  tug, CBJ and FS.   Settled for FS at  $50  and Cindy stripped and got to work on the joystick before climbing on top.  It was all a bit mechanical and I wasn't anywhere near blowing, so she finished off with a HJ.

Cleaned me up and there is a shower there although it's a bit small.  I probably wouldn't go back again, at least not for Cindy, but other punters may have a different view or better experiences.

Person's Name : Kristy

Establishment : Oriental Health Centre

Date of Visit : 26th April

Address : 657 Botany Rd, Rosebery

Hours of Business : 10am till 7pm (I think)

Rates : approx. $35/30 mins, $50/45mins, $60/60 mins, $90/90mins

Age : 33+

Size/shape : B cup, very ordinary slightly plumpish body

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage + naked HJ 

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : After my disappointing recent experiences at 635 Gardeners Rd, I decided to try a place that hadn’t been reviewed for a while

Upon walking in it was cleat this place was a converted one bedroom apartment. You’re meted at the top of the stairs with a security gate where a girl appears. When you go in, there’s the small loungeroom where they watch tv. Next room is the massage room and a dodgy looking kitchen just passed the massage room.

The first thing that struck me was how bad the place smelt. From the outside and all the signage I actually thought this was going to be some kind salon inside. But it’s a dingy place. I arranged for a 1 hour massage. I stripped off and laid on the massage bed. It actually had hand placement pads low on the side of the bed. I put my hands on them and they were oily and gross feeling, obviously from passed customers and them not cleaning afterwards. 

The girl came in and started. Massage was ok actually, firm which I like but very rough at times. No tackle tickle at all. (What’s with it lately, no tackle tickle from the ML’s?!?!) 

The smell of the place actually made me want to just get out. And the lack of any tackle tickle made me not want to even ask about extras. But at roll over I thought I’d see what her extra skills were like. Arranged for naked handjob for an extra $40. Asked about a blow job, she said she only did CBJ. She looked like she had a good rack when she was clothed. When she stripped off, they were far from being perky and firm. But she was actually thinner then she looked clothed. She allowed hands on pussy during HJ.

Nothing special here and just felt dirty by the time I left.

Funny thing as I was leaving, the other girl was in the lounge – she was short and a lot fatter but looked younger than she ML I had. I asked her what the name of the ML was and she couldn’t tell me. The other girl came back out from the kitchen area and said her name was Kristy.

Either way, not good value for money. It’s a dingy, dirty place, with below average looking girls.

 Services Provided : Massage, R/T 

 Value for money/recommend? : no!

 My experience/comments : I was in the neighborhood to get some coffee at the nearby coffee roasters and had some extra time so decided to try a quick 30 minute massage at this place. Bad idea! Went up the stairs, rang the bell, older woman answered and so I thought she must be the mamasan. Tried to ask her whether the place has showers, but she doesn't understand and eventually another ML yells out "yes!" from another room where she's in with a client. Get shown to a room and pay for 30 mins, expecting someone else to come to massage me. Nope. Grandma sticks around and I almost thought about leaving but my back's been sore lately so I figure a therapeutic massage might help and so stayed. Bad idea again. Massage is weak, sloppy, rushed. She starts bumping up against the nether regions, eventually asks me to turn over, and uses her broken english to ask if I want a handjob. I declined before she gave me a price. Clearly disappointed, she rushed through a bit more massage then sent me to the shower to clean up. By now the other girl has finished with her client and as I'm showering I can hear them yelling at each other in Chinese. I see the other ML on my way out, she's a 40-ish MILF with good english.

I passed by here again one morning last week and they were open already at 9:30 so I thought to duck inside to see whether it might be worth getting a massage. A different older woman to last time opens the door and asks:
"You want massah?" 
I reply: 
"Yes, is anybody else working?"
Her response:
"You want massah?"
And again I reply:
"Yes, but is anybody else working?"
She says "come with me" and leads me over to one of the rooms then says "You want massah?"

Obviously this was going nowhere so I walked out, not realizing this would be just the first of several misadventures for the day.

Person's Name : No idea. Was attempting to Zen myself so no communication was to be had.

Establishment : Oriental Healing Centre - 657 Botany Road, Rosebery

Date of Visit : A Monday in August

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 02 8061 6698

Hours of Business : 9:30am - 7pm from the Door.

Rates : $60/60mins.

Age : 40's easy.

Size/shape : Short, Dumpy, B cup.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Unknown. I'm guessing Chinese.

Services Provided : Massage (kinda) HE

Value for money/recommend? : NOOOOOOOoooooooOOOOooooOOO.

My experience/comments :

I truly took one for the team today. This is going to be a short and sweet review. I've driven past and seen this on Botany road, while stuck behind a truck, or avoiding the turning cars, and wondered "I wonder whats up there?". Previous experience with Stairways has always been a stairway to heaven, but in this case, this was a stairway to lesson to learn.

I've been fairly lucky in my punting history to not really have a dud yet. Sure there has been some experiences that haven't been great, but at least the girl was marginally attractive and mini-pan was ok with that. However this was like being massaged by an older Chinese lady who served my Sweet and Sour pork from the 5 dollar shops. 

If the massage was good, then I would have ignored it, but it was more just random sweeps of her calloused hands with liberal doses of oil. I should have walked as soon as she opened the door, but it had been 5 days, I'd already parked and walked etc and I needed to get one off. You know its bad when she is stroking you, and you are thinking about the chores you need to do that day, like visit Bunnings. I think I ended up finishing while thinking about a cute Chinese girl at the supermarket checkout the other day. I was considering what to have for dinner, and that must have helped me get over the line. I don't think I even got hard.

Anyway, if you like short dumpy older woman with bad breath, this is your jam. This is probably the harshest review I've ever written but, I'm just being honest. Hate on me all you want.

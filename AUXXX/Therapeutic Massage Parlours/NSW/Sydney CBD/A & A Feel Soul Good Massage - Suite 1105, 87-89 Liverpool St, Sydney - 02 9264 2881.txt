Chinese RnT, with decent serious massage. They do get women customers.  $70/60+$20 HJ

The boss, Jenny, does a really good, really really hard massage if you have real back problems. And she is good at HJ too. She has the usual mix of Asian (mostly Chinese) students. Last time I saw her, she used me as a training session for the young girl, so I got 4 hands massage, which was enjoyable. Only 2 hands for the HJ, sadly...

To go there, look for the blue sign for "commercial suites" at 87-89 Liverpool St at World Tower. Then take the lift just inside to level 11. The entry is around here:

went back to Jenny's place which seems to have changed management.

Saw Lucy the rub wasn't as hard as i would like, she got me over the line pretty easily.

She was in tights and short dress, face wasn't too bad.

$35 for massage +15 for the tug, no clothes removed, just gentle touching allowed

maybe go back.

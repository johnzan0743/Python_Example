Erotic Massage Sydney, Sexy Massage Sydney, Adult Services Sydney,

Price - $250 per hour
Name - No idea, Language barrier
Service - Nuru Massage, Sukebe, CBJ, HJ
Girl - Thai, maybe early 30s late 20s, average body, bit of a belly, small breasts, slightly large ass, very minimal English skills, not the best looking face at all.

So I've had various tantric massages over the world and figured I'd try here, I hadn't seen a review for this place yet.
Started with a typical very oily massage, turning into a body to body massage all over my back, with a lot of breast rubbing over me and ass/pussy rubbing all over. Despite the girl having a largish ass, it actually worked well, nice big plump ass cheeks rubbing over mine and all over my legs. Plenty of oil to slide all over the place. Plenty of pussy/ass rubbing on my back whilst she gently played with my balls and around the general area. After about half an hour of this she asked if I wanted to try the sukebe chair. Seeing I've never been in it, I figured why not. The chair has a split in it, so the girl can reach between your legs whilst rubbing all around. After plenty of teasing everywhere, she slipped the dom on and started with one hell of a bj. I would have to rank this as one of the best I've ever received. Add to the fact that both her hands knew exactly where to touch, it was amazing. She was good at knowing when I was close and backing off to rub our bodies together for a bit. She must have had me close three or four times. After the first time with a bit of playing around my arse, she asked if I'd like a finger in there. Not ever having a prostate massage, I figured why not, it was feeling good so far. Now I never thought I'd enjoy it, but whatever she was doing with a finger up there, one hand massaging my balls, and my cock in her mouth, it was amazing.
After bringing me close a few times, it was back to the bed for some more b2b massage with plenty of slip and slide. After a while she was on top, cow girl with her pussy rubbing just above my cock. Her hands then went to work, everywhere down there, it was amazing to say the least. Grinding into me and rubbing me with plenty of oil did the trick and i exploded all over her stomach.

All in all, I was pretty hesitant at first, thinking that I could get much better looking girls at Sirs or anywhere else. But once she got to work, it was worth it, even just for the bj.
The Nuru oil washes off pretty easily, much easier than other massage places I've been to.

As I was leaving I noticed another girl who (judging by their conversation) had just finished with someone, and she was a looker. Now I don't normally like asian girls too much, but wow. this girl was tall, fit, beautiful face, and amazing ass and breasts. I just got the other one by bad luck (Or maybe good luck, great skills).

Yeh you can get FS for that price, but for the bj and hj and being on edge for so long, it was worth it.

Glad to see Nuru taking off. I had one at SWL in Hargrave (see report). However it seems to be a premium product at the moment. The more its available the cheaper it should become.

Person's Name : Les

Establishment : Jevou Nuru Massage

Date of Visit : 5 September 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :0497 005 505/  5 Kings La Darlinghurst/  Erotic Massage Sydney, Sexy Massage Sydney, Adult Services Sydney,

Hours of Business : Not known - Appointment only - possibly 10am to 8pm see below

Rates : As per web site $250 to $420/hr for FS

Age : 20s

Size/shape : Slim size 8 B cup shaved

Nationality or Ethnicity : Indian

Services Provided : Nuru massage, B2B and HR

Value for money/recommend? : Probably

My experience/comments : Mods, this operator offers full service and is not really a massage parlour, suggest consider reclassification, not quite sure to what though.

Having read Alex's review above, thought I would try them out.  Very interesting experience indeed.  I enjoyed the hour but have a couple of reservations.

I telephoned the number on the web site but no answer.  Almost immediately I received a return SMS asking if I wanted to make a Nuru Massage booking.  I don't like SMS so phoned straight back ---------- no answer.  I gave in and SMS'd a suggested time, answer came straight back confirming and providing address.

I arrived at the nominated time, place is in a small group of terrace houses in a side street.  No door bell so knocked on the door which was opened by a slim dark Indian girl.  She confirmed my name and ushered me upstairs to a small bed room where we discussed available services which were as per web site.  I opted for 1 hr nuru B2B massage, first half on sukebe chair and second half on mattress for $250.  Shower in very cramped bathroom then Les sat me in the chair and gave me a most erotic massage with what I assume to be warm nuru gel from a bowl.  The massage was slow and sensual with a lot of eye and body contact and the sukebe chair allowed Les full access to my nether regions.

After 15min or so Les asked me to lie  down on the mattress and gave me a full on slippery B2B massage both sides.  Slow and erotic with more eye contact.  The only concern I had was she was trying for heavy unprotected genital contact almost to the point of penetration which I had to quick stop.  Shame, would have been very nice but    ---------- This was further than I was prepared to go, others who have a greater risk tolerance may enjoy this.  Les did not appear to have any touching limits and she has a lovely slim body.  Finished with a very nice HJ with plenty of external anal stimulation.  

After we had finished, Les had a shower first while I lay on the mattress with the nuru gel drying to a sticky second skin  .  In the shower the gel washed of very nicely.  Out the door in exactly 60 min.  No sign of anyone else in the house, diary on table at foot of stairs appeared to have 3 apts for the day.

Les is from India, has been here 3 years with reasonable English.  I asked about the SMS only booking process and she said this was through a receptionist, asked which website I had used and said there was another location in Sydney. 

WIR?  Perhaps, fairly expensive. Maybe only occasional.  Has the look/feel of a solo operator but clearly this is not so.

Les' comments re websites caused me to research further, interesting business model, see below:

Excellent review Antares. 

As far as the classification goes, my view is that the review as classed by what ever it was advertised as, and not what was provided on the day by the service provider.

If you get FS from a massage place, well done, but the rest of us will probably leave with a massage.

In this case the web site is amazingly up front about the Nuru service but most of the other services start at massage.

Nice review antares. I agree with the sms booking, it did get pretty annoying. I didn't get quite the heavy genital contact that you did, which is probably a good thing. They got close, but never touched! phew.

Name of establishment - nuru massage, darlinghurst
date of visit-28 september
contact details- www.nurumassage.com.au mobile 0458490750
opening hiurs- 10 am till 9 pm
rates- $250 for anbhour for nuru and sukebe chair massage
age- early thirties
size/shape- size 8 curvy c cup breasts

Nationality- chinese philippino mix
services provided- nude massage, oral optional, body to body
value for money- not quite sure

I have been hearing a lot about nuru massage and was very keen to experience one. Called up the number and was provided diredtions to an upmarket apartment in darlinghurst.iwas assigned Sarah a friendly curvy lady. I was led to a room with a large mattress on the floor.i opted for a mix of sukebe chair massage and nuru on the bed.
after the customary shower, she started off with the chair session. She got herself naked and poured a liberal amount of nuru on me- very slippery.the chair has a cavity through which she massaged my balls and dick- very sensual.
then it was time for the session on the bed.again lots of nuru and body slides with it.the slipperiness aws quite sensual and something different.after sessions both front and back she finished off with a nuru hand job.

On the whole, a new experience, but very pricey- oral would be an extra $70 and for touching her pussy it would be another extra! I will not go back

There is a girl here I got introduced to called Sarah, apparently thai. I took one look at her and definitely thought she was a ladyboy. Very masculine looking face, strong chin, broad shoulders. Straight away asked if she was a guy, to which she gave a nervous laugh and covered her face and replied she wasn't, but I wasn't having any of it, so asked for who else was available. I recommend Kilana at this place, although it is very very expensive.

You can try the Kings Massage at Chequers on Goulburn St, very similar service @$189/hr with Korean girls.

After the Nuru / b2b on the wet mattress on the floor and HJ or Spanish finishes, you can get a regular part I massage on a proper massage table .

Plus other spa facilities / free and no time limits:

Sauna
Steam bath
Hot and cold water pool
Comfortable lounge area with complimentary coffee tea juices you can relax to watch some sports or Chinese TV drama either before or after your session 

Cheers

See http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f57/ch...ht=Goulburn+St
especially Lungor's excellent post on a 'soapy massage' (Nuru) at http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f57/ch...html#post89515

From my point of view, when in Sydney where else would you go ?

Samara is one of a kind. Professional masseuse, elegant lady, looks like 25-28, from Europe with sexy accent. Massage I had was NURU, which is sensual body sliding. It was performed in a special chair for the reach around and tackle caress. Amazing experience, she uses warm nuru gel from seaweed oil, and special nuru chair. Best way to escape in a lunch time or before/after work. Definitely repeat.

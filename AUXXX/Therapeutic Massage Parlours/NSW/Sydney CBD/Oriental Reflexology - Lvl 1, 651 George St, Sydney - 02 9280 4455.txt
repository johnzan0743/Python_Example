Contact Details/Address: Lvl 1 651 George St Sydney Ph: 02 9280 4455

Prices: 30/60 $40/$70

Age: late 40's

Size/shape: Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Very good pure massage

Value for money/recommend ? Reasonable value, but a great effective massage

My experience: Took a punt on this place hoping there may be extras on offer. The set-up indicated this was somewhat unlikely, but I wouldn't rule it out 100%. It was basically just 1 large room sectioned off with thin curtains and massage tables.

Anyway, the massage by Susan was excellent. As I wouldn't consider her attractive, if extras had been offered I probably would have declined. Having said that, if the other girl that was there when I arrived (cute, early 20's), I would have definitely parted with some more cash.

My experience/comments :

Was down in Haymarket and there's so many Thai massage joints now it's hard to choose. I decided to try this place, nicely fitted out, actual rooms instead of just curtains, although the walls do not go to the ceiling. I was told to get ready and take off all my clothes, so a good start for these places.Very good massage , no tickle tackle so not sure if I was going anywhere. Girl was very chatty and nice to talk with, I was talking a little in Thai so that helped. I said i normally go for nude massage with BJ asked she did do special massage for $30. I took her up on the offer, quite funny she was telling me all about her Thai boyfriend while she was massaging my balls. On the turn around I sat up and start play with her boobs, no resistance so I took them out of her bra for a better feel, really nice boobs for thai and would have paid more for naked but she said that she did not do. So just lied back enjoy the massage and tug. I would recommend as unlike most R&T you actually get a decent massage here, I have been a few times now and enjoyed it everytime.

Person's Name : Nina

Establishment : Town Hall Massage

Date of Visit : last week

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Townhall CBD Massage home page

Hours of Business : 7 days, 10am - 8pm

Rates : $40 for 30 mins, plus $20 clothed hj

Age : 23ish

Size/shape : 170cms, slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage, hj

Value for money/recommend? : so so

My experience/comments : This place is on Kent st, behind town hall, just south of Bathurst st. The entrance is between Adina apartments, on the corner and a sushi restaurant.  Through the glass doors of  the apartment block, turn right at the elevators, down the stairs and to your left. Discreet entrance.  On entering a youngish papasan met me and explained the deal and sorted the financials. He suggested a double massage , which I declined.
The place is clean and spacious. He showed me to a room, also clean and spacious, and clinical rather than the more relaxed style shown on their website.  (Similarly, the rather exotic lady on the website wasn't visible. Who'd of thought). 
Nina entered the room. She is tall, slim and quite pretty and wearing a short, white tunic. I lay down for the massage and it was ok.  A bit of prodding and touching. Not therapeutic nor sensual. Not much worth commenting on. On turnover she offered hj $20 and nude hj $50. I felt uninspired to pay the $50 and so I went for the clothed hj offer. She said "that's ok, it's up to you". I sensed I may have been missing something. Perhaps their main product is something more. Anyway an adequate hj was delivered. I dressed and departed.

Services Provided : massage, nude hj

Value for money/recommend? : yep

My experience/comments : 
Thought as this is my first punt of the year would try somewhere new and chose this place as I had read Siegfried's report and thought
why not. So following his excellent directions - don't turn right at the bottom of the stairs as there is a legit place along the hall.
Turn left left and you will see a paper sign saying the way. Rang the buzzer as the door was locked and a young papasan bade
me enter and did exactly as Siegfried - told me the price and said why not a double. Not on the first date thanks. So no a single
and 30 mins please and paid. Showed me to a room to the right, which is quite large and clean - all OK so far.

So started stripping off and in walked Honey and she is tall for a Chinese - Hong Kong girl she says - with a cream form fitting
dress and she looks great. Walks up and gives me a closed kiss on the mouth and a hug and says in a sexy voice do you
just want a massage. Wow not very often am I surprised by a place that looks legit but this time I am. Ask what is on offer
$20 HJ, $50 nude hj and body slide, add $20 for DATY. I gave her a pineapple and said just the nude thanks with a smile. She
stripped off with me and then before I got on the bed she sat me on the edge and opened my legs and gave me another hug.
Her crouch was more or less rubbing against mine. My hands started to wander and she said tits and pussy OK - outside only. 
I asked if I could suck on her wonderful nipples and she smiled and said yes. She has a nice and very responsive set of nipples that
require safety glasses to suck on otherwise you could lose an eye.. I then started to play with her pussy at the same time 
as sucking her nipples - she got a little bit wet and she was playing lightly with my cock. This was very nice. We went like this
for a few more minutes and she said lie down I'll give you a body rub. She made lie face down which in my current state was a little 
bit uncomfortable but did it anyway. She then rubbed her tits and pussy over my back and legs - great. She climbed off and started 
to play with my cock and arse in a very teasing way - asked where she learned all this and she said with a laugh ex boyfriends. She
then learned over and whispered in my ear that it was turnover time.

She then put a bit of oil on my front and started a front slide with her tits - no pussy this time, that have been awesome. Every time
she got up near my face she would put one of her tits in my mouth and after a little suck she would remove them and give me another kiss.
Definitely likes kissing this girl, when she got near my crutch she would rub her tits on my now very hard cock. She did this for a few more minutes
and then climbed off. She added a little bit more oil to my old fella and started a slow tug with lots of ball play - just how I like it. Meanwhile my hands
were playing with tits and now damp pussy which she seemed to enjoy. Again every minute or so she learn over and give me a kiss - very nice. She
quickened her pace a bit and I did the same and in a few minutes said I was about to blow whereby she gave me a full on kiss and I came. hot towel
clean up and gone. I have no idea if she can massage I was having way to much fun playing with her body.

Now I am not sure if this is the standard service that she provides or the old YMMV thing - but this is the first time we have met and we clicked and I feel
very lucky. I also asked if she did FS or CBJ and no she doesn't - She works Monday to Wednesday

Services Provided : massage, nude hj

Value for money/recommend? : OK - Honey was better

My experience/comments : 
Went here again as I was in the area and was going to try and see Honey for round 2. Unfortunately
she was booked and I got Nana -  pretty girl. She works Sunday and Monday - note most weekdays there are 4 girls
working here. So the young papasan takes me into the room and says how long - I give over the forty and he leaves.
In walks Nana and as I said she is quite pretty - she is wearing the white tight fitting dress which was the same as 
Honey wore the other week. Asked what was on the menu and usual 20 / 50 options were given. Thought for a second and
handed over the pineapple for the nude. We both stripped and she has the body described above which is quite nice. My
hands started to explore tits OK for play and sucking but no pussy touching. OK started sucking on her tits while she plays with
my cock. Now I was not in the mood for a massage I wanted to play so I had her lay down on the table face and I continued sucking
on her tits while my hands wonder up and down her legs and inner thighs.  She likes her tits flicked with your tongue seems to set her
off. After a few more minutes of this she said your turn and we changed places. 

She then put a bit of oil on me and her tits and started a body rub which was ok with being spectacular,  which ended up with her tits in my
mouth again and her rubbing her legs and crouch against my cock - pretty good. This carried on for another 10 minutes and she climbed off
and started the HJ part of the show. Her technique needs a bit of work and I showed her what I like and she soon got the hang of it - she
is pretty new to this line of work - only been in the industry for a few weeks. This continued for a while longer and I eventually erupted and as
she was leaning over the table got some on side and tits - she said you to strong and giggled. Not bad for an old bloke. Clean up with hot
towels a bit of a head massage and gone.

Nana works Sunday and Monday - I don't know what her massage is really like but I think she needs a bit more experience. Will return again to see
if I can get Honey

 Value for money/recommend? : Yes 

 My experience/comments : 

This is basement massage that has been open for 2 months - nice  clean place. I wandered into this place on a Sunday early afternoon and it was quite busy. I walked into the reception and receptionist was quite pretty nice bolt ons, I bet she will be available in the week. $ girls to choose from o Sundays more during the week. There was only two girls available and I went for Nana.

 Went into the room - nice and clean, larger than some of the rooms that you normally have for these places. I undressed and in walk Nana. Nice chatty girl from South Korea and been there since it opened 2 months ago. She started massaging my back and asked how I would like my massage - I said nice and sexy, she laughed and said we better give you soft massage then. She massage my shoulders and back for all of 5 mins and then moved down to massaging my bottom -  she was all ready massaging my legs and brushing those fingers against the balls and we where not even into 10 mins. She said she like my bottom and I turned my head and said hers looked better and lifted her dress up for a better look. She did not object and left the dress up so I could she her in her panties - she pulled away when my hand went inside towards her pussy. I mentioned that she could massage my bottom as much as she like and also is she like to massage between my cheeks. She just smiled and then proceed to concentrate on my arse, butt crack and balls for the next 15 mins. 

Nana suggested that I could turn around at any stage, and after 15-20 mins of her massage my balls I was standing like a trooper. I turned around and said that we still have 35 mins left and she winked and said she would make me last until the end - and signed $50 tip was required. Off she stripped - nice body very petite and clearly enhanced boobs. She quickly jumped on the table and without any warning she had one of those nipples in my mouth. She clearly loves those nipples sucked which I obliged for 10 mins. All the time she was rubbing my cock down to my balls and down the crack. She moved down towards my cock an I signalled said is she wanted she could return the favour and lick and suck my cock like I had with her nipples - she just smiled but maybe if I go back a few times. On went the ball massage for another 15 mins and I was getting close - she move back and more nipple sucking - she really gets off on this and then I was over the line.  A quick clean up and out of the door. 

I would go back but I would try someone else, the receptionist looks like a fun girl - Nana works Sundays and Mondays and is worth a punt.

Rates : $40/30, $55/45

Age : 22

Size/shape : Tiny -size 6. Slim about 5'4"

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : So so

My experience/comments : Phoned ahead to book Honey after some good reviews. Told by mamasan that Honey no longer works there. She tells me 7 girls available. Given the really shitty weather in Sydney, no surprise that everyone stayed away....lol

Anyway, I am staying in hotel 2 blocks away and grab an umbrella and walk down there. Walk in and mamasan asks how long. I take the 30 minutes. She shows me to the room and tells me to get undressed. I ask about the girls and remind her that she says I would have a choice. At that point, in retrospect I should have insisted or walked.

Mamasan tells me she will get JoJo. I ask if JoJo gives good service...of course the answer is yes!

JoJo walks in. Tiny little thing. Quite pretty and very friendly. Asks if I want heard, medium or soft. I ask for hard now and soft later. She gives a good, strong massage the way I like it. Absolutely no accidental touching or any other touching while I am on my stomach - just like a legit massage. She leaves to get some hot towels. returns and cleans of the oil.

Asks me to turn over. Grabs the tackle and asks if I want this massaged. I said yes. She asks "take my dress off?" I say yes, how much. Fifty she says. I ask if I can touch too. Yes she says. I ask about BJ and FS....no to both.

Gets her dress and undies off...very very slim. Small A sized boobs and small nipples. She puts oil on and starts the tug. Slow she asks...yes I say! She lets me touch Her boobs...and then moves close so I can suck them...very enjoyable. I ask if she wants me to massage her while gently rubbing her pubic hair. "End of period...next time" Yeah....OK
She gives me a couple of very light pecks on the lips...barely passing for a kiss. After a few minutes I finish. She leaves to get more towels to clean me up .She returns, cleans me up, I give her $50 and leave

Look, overall a descent massage and a pleasant time. But she just stopped short with every move and touch on her of letting go and making it a great experience. If she had just allowed a little more follow through and got a bit more involved I would be writing a different review....this time it was close but for $90 all up for 30 minutes, there is better value around. A shame.

JoJo is at TAFE and only works Tuesdays....given that I am only in Sydney for 3 days, I won't get a chance to go back to her. If I had a chance I may take another punt....she could be so good....but it may be another of the same...almost great but just short of the mark and I leave questioning the 90 bucks I just spent

Dropped by here on the way home from work and met the boss lady on the front desk. Opted for an hour and she tried to upsell me to a doubles massage, which I turned down as this was my first visit and told her next time. Dealt with the financials and was ushered into the room. Undressed and laid on the table when Sarah came in. 

THe massage was pretty good - lots of elbows and fingers to iron out the kinks. AT the flip, she worked on the front before offering a nude HJ for $50. I accept ed on the basis that I could toucha nd finger her, which she was happy to do. SHe started on the HJ with me playing with her  tittys and fingering her, playing with her clit. It wasn't long her I shot a wad.

Good experience and may take up on the doubles offer...

A Fairfax Media investigation has found that during one typical day at "Town Hall Massage" last week, five female workers provided services to 59 male clients, over an 11-hour shift. Based on a minimum spend scenario, Wu is accumulating an annual cash turnover of at least $2 million.
			
		

Mr Duff's arithmetic needs work - or he needs to clarify what he means by "minimum spend". at $65 per hour, she would see $35. 60 clients per day 354 days per year means her take is a maximum $766,000 (give or take a few hundred ...) if every booking is one hour. So he must be including the girls' cut and what extras are negotiated in the room - which the mamasan never sees.

But no mention of Brothel Busters or Mr Seage this time ...

I think some of us may of missed a significant point, both here and elsewhere.

Investigators viewed the CCTV footage to monitor the girls and the number of patrons.  This means they also have your image!!!

CCTV records you entering and leaving a building, it is one thing for this to be a security feature within a massage joint, it is another when it the foyer of the building.

Heads up, if you want to be under the radar, stop getting video'd entering and leaving a massage shop.

Good analysis EG,

I posted a similar dissection in another forum and I think we have very similar outcome !

Basically the $2M is grossly inflated !

According to his own words : there were 59 customers during the day of 11 hr shift, based on minimum spent the shop is making $2 M annually !

Assuming there are indeed 59 customers a day, 365 days a year ! Working backwards , the shop needs to make $92.87 off each customer to make the 2M! If it is a FS shop, possible just on the turn over ! But the shop won't make that much as a higher cut would go to the girls . 

Being a RnT , the shop is only getting the cut in the massage fees, either $25 or $35 per customer, so if they do get 59 jobs a day (a lot lot less on the weekends though) , the absolute max of the income would be around $650K, but that title compare to $2M , I can understand why he inflated it so much .........lol

Here is a further development. I just went to check this place out. After walking through the entrance to the building, before I can head to the shop, the guy behind the desk demands I fill out the visitor book and he wants photo ID.  I said why,  it is a commercial premises. Would not let me in. I  wonder if he is selling the names in the book to Mr Duff.

That will slow business down. I am not familiar with the layout of the building, but I believe the shop is down a set of stairs from street level. Are there any other businesses (cafes and the like) inside the entrance door of the building whose customers would also need to sign the visitors' book?

Not everybody carries their driver's licence on them, and there is no requirement for people to carry ID of any sort, so yeah, every punter should sign the book as 'Eamon Duff' and see how that goes..

Madam Wu shuts pop-up brothel Town Hall Massage in Sydney's Maestri Towers





Madam Wu shuts pop-up brothel Town Hall Massage in Sydney's Maestri Towers

A multimillion-dollar pop-up brothel has vanished from the foyer of a Sydney residential complex, after the madam behind it was exposed in a Fairfax Media investigation.

Suki Wu has  hoodwinked authorities for several years, running underground vice dens in apartment buildings, under the guise of therapeutic massage centres.

''Suki'' Xiao Yan Wu was served with a "cease use" notice last month by the City of Sydney after her Town Hall Massage clinic was found to be providing sexual services.

Town Hall Massage, her latest brazen venture, operates inside the Maestri Towers residential complex on Kent Street. It is less than 100 metres from St Andrew's Cathedral School.

But  after a Fairfax Media investigation exposed the illegal operation on Sunday - and its $2 million annual turnover reaped from Asian sex workers having to service up to a dozen men per shift - the business has shut.

"Good riddance; don't come back," was the response from Maestri Towers owner's corporation chairman Michael Heaney who, on behalf of the building's 1500 residents, has been tirelessly battling to evict the madam for more than a year.

He confirmed that after Fairfax Media made Wu aware of its investigation on Saturday, he received an email from a man, believed to be her business partner, stating the "situation with access restrictions" had made it "impractical" for the parlour to continue.

Mr Heaney added: "They [brothel staff] have not turned up for two days. If they do come back, we will have security staff on hand, taking down the personal details of every single client so they can be called to give evidence in any future legal proceedings."

Fairfax Media has viewed extensive footage from inside the building's foyer. The footage revealed that during one typical day at Town Hall Massage earlier this month, five female workers provided services to 59 male clients, over an 11-hour shift.

The shop space itself is cramped and can only accommodate a maximum seven workers in tiny booths. On busy days, more than 70 clients — all male — pass through. Security cameras show that, aside from quick visits to an adjacent toilet, the prostitutes never leave the premises - even through shifts can span 12 hours.

One client, who has contacted Fairfax Media, said that while Wu preferred never to disclose information over the phone about erotic services, "every girl" was required to provide sexual services.

Fairfax can confirm Wu is the same evasive brothel boss who, in 2013, muscled her way into a 23-storey residential complex called the Bentleigh, in Katherine Street, North Sydney, under the guise of "Pretty Baby Massage".

After Willoughby Council finally triumphed in the Land and Environment Court and had her closed down in October 2014, she paid a $15,000 penalty — the equivalent of two busy trading days — then moved the business across the Harbour Bridge into Maestri Towers.  

In recent weeks, private investigators found the business continuing to provide sexual services despite a "cease use" notice having been served by the City of Sydney on January 4.

The NSW Government is currently considering recommendations that flowed from last year's parliamentary inquiry into the regulation of brothels, including greater police powers and a new stand-alone police unit to better identify human trafficking cases and exploitation, and to assist local government shut down rogue operators. A response is scheduled to be tabled by May.

Mr Heaney said he holds "deep concerns" for many of the overseas workers who staff the growing number of illegal brothels popping up in residential buildings across the CBD.

"I've spoken with other owners corporations who share these concerns. But in the absence of any real government support, they are too scared to take these sorts of people on."

Yes. The law - specifically the Summary Offences Act (1988) - defines "Prostitution" as;

(a) Sex (as sex is defined in the Crimes Act) [the actual wording refers to the section of the Crimes Act], and

(b) Masturbation of one person by another [or similar words]

for payment [or maybe they use the term "for reward"]

It has been that way for many years. You can look it up on austlii or legislation.nsw.gov.au if you don't believe me ...

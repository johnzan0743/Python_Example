Place is located next to a convenience store, not sure what its called, but its upstairs and has a sign saying massage  + girls wanted.

30 min or 60 min massage available. Girl was indian (I think). Massage was a quick tease before the main show began (HJ), was fast and methodical, and not worth it. Girl provided some tissues to clean up,  shower was offered but place was not clean.


Not recommended!

I have called past several times over the past few months at different times, and It appears that this shop is closed.
there is a sign on the glass door advertising the business for sale phone owner 0403919375
A shame that we will not be able to sample the wares.

I work near here and visited once. The place is a dump, and I just turned around and left. We're not missing much.

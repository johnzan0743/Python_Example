Saw an ad for "sensual" massage in Glebe and gave them a call on 0420 432 440.
Friendly Asian woman told me the necessary details: $60 hhr, $80 for 45 min, and $100 for 60 min, hours from 10 - 9, no need to make appt, etc.

Has anyone been here?  I know from reading the forum that this address used to be associated with the place on Wattle St. in Ultimo, but perhaps it's under new mgmt.  Any intel is appreciated, although I'll probably have a chance to scout it out myself within the next 2 weeks.

I was going to TOFTT last sunday but this place was closed, had a sign in the window that said they were boked up for the day.

But no one was inside, its right on the corner of University Hall arcade.

It maybe a curtain style joint.

So I ended up going next door to Tang Massage.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Indonesian/Malaysian

Services Provided : Half assed Massage, BBBJ, CIM (Oops sorry dear)

Value for money/recommend? : No & maybe

My experience/comments : Looks like it was my turn to take one for the team here. Strolled in with no appointment. About 3 rooms, walled up but curtains for doors.
I was the only punter there, she asked what time I wanted, said an hour, she asked if I wanted the special, I said yes without knowing what that was.
Basically $20 extra for her to be nude, thought what the heck.
She's not much of a looker, figured I'd be face down for most of it, so off we went. She stripped off, nice little B's & unshaven below.
She proceeded to massage me, with a lazy hand over hand up and down my back and legs and ass...and she began to talk...and talk...
This lady loves to talk and about complete shit too, bullshit massage continued while I got the highlights of her life story....and talk...and talk
She moved up around the table to my face and offered her tits for me to suck on, which of course I endulged...and talk...and talk
On the flip she asked what extras I wanted, BJ was offered but I choose HJ for an extra $20...and talk....and talk
She asked if I wanted to eat her pussy, which I thought sure why not, she then proceeded to give me a BJ (quite good actually) talking stopped for a bit.
I thought she had dommed me up for the BJ, but apparently not and I "arrived" in her mouth, my bad.
Anyway she was good about it and she spit it out into a tissue. Fuck me then back to talking...and talk

Paid her the extra $20 which she was happy with and left. She was still talking when I left.

Did I enjoy myself? Part's of it yes
Did I get to see and feel up a naked woman? Yes but everything has a trade off..and talk

Be nice to know if other ladies are on, was just here there when I went, so I may not be back

After reading Greek's review I am sure he went to the massage shop at University House. 
Tang massage is another 15m down on the same road.
I went there last week after seeing the cracker advert with Kara, Sara and Monica.
Entry is on main road and everyone sees you standing there pressing the buzzer.
I had massages from Cindy, Kara and Monica on different days.
Honestly Cindy gave me one of the best massages I have ever had in my life.
Cindy (size 6, sexy, nice personality, 32B) is Thai but living in Australia for over 10 years already.
Extra services was available from all of the girls.
Not sure whether I should be more detailed but like most RNT shops you can almost get anything if you pay for it.
I paid and got what I wanted.
My only problem is not one of the girls looked like the girls in the cracker pictures but they were OK as substitutes.
Best place to park is the Broadway Shopping Centre 3hrs free.

281 are under new management, all the old girls have left apparently, not sure who is the new owner or if she works there, but the new girls are quite cute. I am not convinced as to who is who on the pictures tho.
I had a massage from Kara, who is NOT who the pic suggests. The pic of Kara is I think Cindy who works as a receptionist. Not sure if she works in the rooms but she is super hot. I need to get to see what she will offer.

Any, I booked Kara (not the girl in the pic tho) on Friday and had a good massage, on turnover time, more was offered, $100 for FS, allowed DATY, seemed to like it too, very enthusiastic, cbj and cum on tits.
Room was adequate, was a little concerned on noise with a sliding door, but a very pleasant experience, I will be back to try others, especially the tiny, big boobed receptionist....Cindy ?

Well worth a visit if near the Broadway part of town.

Cindy is good with massage.
She has enhanced boobs but you wouldn't know unless you expert.
She is worth a try and nice to talk to too.

Just had a Thai sandwich today - Cindy and Cat.
They were the only 2 girls in the shop so I told them to close up and I take both of them for a 1hour session.
Offered them $100 each for the FS on top of massage rate of $120/hr.
It was crazy to have one girl riding on my tongue and the other one on my dick.
There door bell must have rang about 6 times during the hour but I paid for all their time already and the door was locked.
We ran out of condoms since the girls change condoms when they swap positions.
They normally don't do FS and therefore don't have too many condoms in stock. 
Surprising since this is a massage place.

I concur it has recently changed hands and is a lot better.
I've tried two of the girls, one was fresh from Thailand, sorry didn't get names, but service is much better than my old visit
They do have a website, but don't get too excited as its pretty much useless

I tried Kara.
She is medium size, dark skin, nice 32B boobs with dark areola.
Hairy pussy but lots of pussy juices. 
No smell but lots of juices if you love DATY.
Massage is OK and sex is good too.
I went through all the girls here and got them to go FS for extra $100.
Some guys may find it expensive since $120 for the erotic massage and then extra $100 for FS.
Many other nice place in Sydney where $150 already if FS with BBBJ, etc but I guess sometimes we just looking for greener pastures on other side of mountains.

One thing why I love Cindy (previous review above) is that she is only 45kg and nice and skinny.
I love to hook her on my dick and let her hang on me like a koala bear on a tree while I try shake her off.
GREAT FUN!
See how strong your dick is and try it! NO HANDS!

Definitely Cindy not working.
She is the boss and just hires the girls to do the job.
It is a pity because she really was good at massage.
Being a little size 5.5 is great for sex but she has temporarily "retired".

My experience/comments:


After walking past this place multiple times as a side effect of living in the area, I decided that today was the day to give it a go. 

After pressing the doorbell due to the door being locked, I was greeted by a ML who was wearing a silk gown. She immediately showed me to the room and asked how long I wanted to stay. After telling me the prices I handed over $90 for 45 minutes. She then said she would be back in a couple of minutes and left the room. 

Once I was laying on the bed she returned and asked if I wanted an oil massage or dry with "oil later" - I opted for the oil and asked for a strong massage. 

Whilst laying on my back, there was a couple of ball tickles but no arse play - scooting around the anus, which was a little disappointing but as I didn't ask her to, I can't complain. 

She allowed me to play with her arse and breasts, but not her pussy, pushing my hand away when I went near it the first time. The massage was pretty ordinary - maybe a 4/10 if I was generous. 

Once I'm on my back she was straight into the action. Oiled up, with a solid rhythm and a couple of moans from her, it didn't take me long for me to come. 

As we were only 25 minutes in at this stage, I was a little disappointed with her keen timing to get straight into the job. This was short lived however, as I'll elaborate more below. Her obvious distaste for having any of my load touching her fingers, even during the shaft massage was a little off putting, but not so bad. Just a small thing that I noticed.

After what seemed a third of a box of tissues for the cleanup, she left the room and returned with a hot towel to rub me down, then asked me to flip over and wiped the oil from my back. 

She then placed a towel over my back and proceeded with a much better than earlier, Thai massage. Strong, and into the areas that I needed it. a 8/10 massage with this style, and if I were to go back, this is the style I would ask for from the start - Skip the oil and go straight for the Thai style. 

She was kind enough to open the exit door leading into the little shopping corridor, which offered a little more privacy than walking directly onto the street with the flashing neon massage sign in the window. 

All up the place was clean, although no shower was offered so I don't know if they have one to use. ML was friendly, but not so great looking and a little chubby for my taste. If I were to go back to 281, I would try out another ML.

Wow, it's been a long time since this place has been reviewed! Alas, now it seems closed. Window signage taken down and looks like all the furniture gone along with it!
It's a shame - even though I didn't review it due to sheer mediocrity, it was a good reliable option in the area.

[COLOR=#333333][COLOR=#333333]You can find the establishment on George Street in the city at the address above. It can be a little tricky to find as the door is quite small. Look for a hairdresser and the door is to the right. When you enter you will be approaching a travel agent, turn left when you reach the travel agent and the lift will be there (the shop is level 1). You'll find the entrance across the hallway from an accountant's tax office. Also the door will be locked so you need to use the buzzer to get in. 

[/COLOR][/COLOR][COLOR=#333333]The room I was allocated to was pretty nice, I think owner has put some thought into the presentation. I found it to be a pretty good atmosphere. Rooms are fully enclosed as well.

[/COLOR][COLOR=#333333]I was greeted by Sophie and there was also a manager/receptionist working at the time. Once in the room I paid [/COLOR][COLOR=#333333]$40 for half an hour massage but if going for an hour I believe it's $60 for an hour. As this was a short visit I didn't receive much of a massage but Sophie does and awesome body to body which culminated an a handjob to finish.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]All up it was $50 for the B2B/[/COLOR]HJ[COLOR=#333333] and $40 for the half hour massage. Definitely recommended, you should go![/COLOR]

    Value for money/recommend? : Yes good value for money

    My experience/comments :

    Was down in Haymarket and decided to try this place, nicely fitted out, actual rooms instead of just curtains, alyjpugh walls do not go to the ceiling. I was told to get ready and take off all my clothes, so a good start for these places.Very good massage , not tickle tackle so not sure if I was going anywhere. Very chatting and nice to talk with, I was talking a little in Thai so that helped. I said i normally go for nude massage with BJ asked she did do special massage for $30. I took her up on the offer, quite funny she was telling me all about her Thai boyfriend while she was massaging my balls. On the turn around I sat up and start play with her boobs, no resistance so I took them out of her bra for a better feel, really nice boobs for thai and would have paid more for naked but she said that she did not do. So just lied back enjoy the massage and tug. I would recommend as unlike most R&T you actually get a decent massage her.

Person's Name : Hanna (I believe)

Establishment : Choon Massage

Date of Visit : 16/4/14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 647 - 649 George St, Sydney NSW

Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm

Rates : $50 for 45mins

Age : mid to late 20s

Size/shape : slim. tall about 5"6'

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean

Services Provided : Massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend? : would come again

My experience/comments : Two girls available, the first girl who opened the door, was in leopard print and had a belly button ring (not the thing that turns me on even if she looked pretty good). Asked to see if anyone else was available and they said yes. Hanna walked out. I used to see Ari here. She was slim and petite, and gives a good massage and finishing. 

Hanna was tall very pale skin and not too skinny and not too fat. Quite nice but looked older than her claimed 24yrs old. She tried to get me to pay for a B2B but was not that interested. Just wanted a good massage and a release in tension.

Her massage was quite ok, I was quite tight and she massaged my back and neck above the usual standards. The massage went on for like 30 minutes. I just laid there quiet and wasn't in to much conversation.

Then I was asked to turn over at the 30min mark. Nothing that erotic, she got smallish one up and finished me off in about 10mins. Was left to get my clothes  on in the last few minutes.

Will come again some day but probably give Hanna a miss

Went to this new shop last wknd. Friendly mamasan and I like the fit out. Its in a building full of office so maybe quite private to visit.
Asked for 45min b2b. $100 upfront. Was told there was a young krean girl. I had high hopes for Ivy when she turned up she a bit chubby but amazing rack and seemed friendly. She said 1/2 japanese 1/2 vietnamese who knows if she was telling the truth. 
Unfortunately the b2b wasn't good at all she climbed on my back for a body slide for maybe 30 sec but when she flipped she stood where I couldn't touch her all except her side! Not even breast. made experience bad because she I thought didn't want to be there. Ok fair enough maybe she hates this job but there are lots of other jobs just not as well paid!
Would return to choon bc other brothers reviews are good but not see her ahain.

Person's Name : Mimi (according to voucher card)

Establishment : Choon Massage

Date of Visit : 27/02/15

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 647 - 649 George St, Sydney NSW

Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm

Rates : $120hr (includes B2B)

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : Slim, 5"4' A cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean

Services Provided : B2B, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : I saw Mimi, she has been around a few massage shops all over the place. Some may know her by other names but the name I have known her appears to be her real name and hence she now goes under the name of Mimi. I believe she tried Masstig8, North Sydney (Mount St), QVB, and some others. Bit of a floater but has recently wound down her work rate to finish study. She will only work when she needs cash. I saw her at QVB when Candy was running the show. For some reason she gave me her email address after that first go and I've managed to catch her here at Choon a few times here and there. I have been off the punting scene for a while. Here and there I will try and see a regular like Yuki@Wattle.  

Mimi is petite, not for the melon lovers as she doesn't have a handful but has perky nipples. She is slim, used to look too slim, but I think this time she added a bit of meat and looks just about right. 

Started with face down massage, and I'm not a fan of the oil. So the towel goes on and she gives me a good solid rub on my back and lower back. Massage is firm to very firm. It's very good to get the knots out, the massage comes with back walking too which is rare these days. She does know what she is doing and that's why I have seen her probably a handful of times over the years. 

The massage is not so erotic and the business gets done for around 40mins solid. Off goes the towel and she takes her tight fitting short dress off. She leaves her g string on. She gives you a gentle cat bath whilst still face down. It feels all very rewarding, as she also brushes your sack during the cat bath to build up some tension. 

You then get told to turn around and I oblige. Cat bath continues, and at this stage i just pull the g string off and look at her snatch. I don't get to play down there as she decides to sit on top of me (not straddled as even if I ask to go inside it is a big NO). she keeps pulling away and her technique some may say is rushed but it is a combination of a decent speed and touching of the sack.  If the HJ is fast i normally can hold back a little I need it slow and gentle to get over the line, so that is what I asked for. A big load came out as I hadn't released any tension for a few days. Again felt very satisfied after the massage.

Massage is really well rated, the happy ending is a bit mechanical but she is a pretty girl and not too princess like. Speaks relatively good english and you can have a conversation if you like

Person's Name : Aya

Establishment : Choon massage 647-649 George street Sydney

Date of Visit : 2/4/15

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business : 10-8 I think

Rates : 40 for 30mins.... cant remember the other price... they have a piece of paper with lots of prices... 30 mins, 45mins, nude, non nude... it was a bit confusing actually + 20 for clothed tug

Age : early 30's maybe late 20s

Size/shape : sexy puppy fat. not slim but not chubby... quite nice actually

Nationality or Ethnicity : 

Services Provided : Rub and tug

Value for money/recommend? : yep

My experience/comments : popped in this place after work for 30mins before the long weekend...first you negotiate with the owner and then she brings the girl in.. Aya was quite pretty and would love to bang her but its only massage there so no go..

She gave a reasonable massage that was better than most I have had recently... she actaully came across as someone who knows how to massage but just didnt have much energy to do it that day... lasted about 15 minutes or so before a lovely TT started with the legs and worked her way up to my ever tightening balls... she drapped her hair over my body and kept playing... I was rock hard in no time and turned over for the tug... she had a great two handed technique and also one  where she pulls your bals and strokes your shaft.... she made me blow in no time quick... she gave the look in the eye like she wanted you to come... it was sexy thinking of wanting t bang this girl....

So in summary... decent massage with a great hand job...


would go back for sure

Establishment : Choon Massage

Date of Visit : 16/May/2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 647 - 649 George St, Sydney NSW   Choon Massage

Hours of Business : 10 am - 8 pm

Rates : Varies but i paid $65 ph

Age : 25 ish

Size/shape : Slim/Pretty

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean

Services Provided : Just a bloody massage

Value for money/recommend? : No/No

My experience/comments : I did my research and checked this forum before going, seemed a no brainer for a cheap R'n"T in the CBD.

Small place up a lift, 3 rooms maybe, I was lead into the main room by some lady who's lunch I interupted.
Was sent in a cute Korean girl, didn't ask her name. Massage seemed to go well, not very sensual but not bad either.
We chatted a bit, she was wearing this flimsy Asian dress, which was sexy and gave me a good look up her crotch when she sat on the bed.

Turn over time...nothing? WTF!
I have been to a few of these enough to know the routine well enough:

Back
Arms
Legs
Bum
Towel off, turn over please
Legs
Oh you want this massaged too?????
Unfair haggling session
Happy ending
Clean up 
Head massage (The other one)

So as you may have guessed a very important step was missed for me in the usual routine.

I enquired about my missing section, all she said was sorry times up.
There is a hand drawn scrawly message next to the massage rates which is extra time minutes, $20 for 10 mins or so, something to that effect.

She didn't mention it and I didn't bite, so out the door she went. 
Maybe she didn't fancy giving me one? 
Maybe trying to scam some extra time plus the HE money, who knows.

So I got dressed and left. There was 3 of them in the waiting room as I left. No HJ no tip.
If they want to survive on just "massages alone: then good luck to them. I've seen in a the previous reviews that it appears to be only me who got no mileage.

So this may just have been my bad luck day

Will I return?
Will I fuck!

Went straight off to Bamboo massage to get my deserts.

Person's Name : Amy (massage) and Helen (HJ)

Establishment : Choon Massage

Date of Visit : 21 June 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 647-649 George street Sydney

Hours of Business : 10am to 9pm (I think)

Rates : Various rates on a sign in the room... bit confusing. I recall there were two prices for 60 minutes: $65 and $120. I assume $120 included nude b2b. I paid $65 for the hour plus $20 for a clothed tug.

Age : 22 (Amy) and 24 (Helen)

Size/shape : Both looked delicious. Amy was around 160m and size 6 and b/c cup. Very slim in a very short tight skirt. Great legs! Very attractive young Japanese girl. Helen (who was on reception only) was around 165cm and size 8 I would guess and c cups. She was in tight black leggings which highlighted her great legs and ass. 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Amy is Japanese and Helen is Korean

Services Provided : Just a massage from Amy and Helen did the (clothed) HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, certainly for Helen's HJ skills!!

My experience/comments : Had been in town on business and dropped into a few places over the weekend based on past reviews but didn't like who I saw. I was keen to try CDB Posh at 107 Quay. Dropped in on Saturday and Sunday but both times the girls available looked noticeably older than what was claimed (I prefer around 20-25). Another on my list was Choon Massage... Easy to find on George street, discreet entrance, up the stairs and buzzed the door. An attractive girl (Helen) with a warm and friendly smile greets me and asks if I've been before (I always say yes) and takes me to a vacant massage room. I ask if she'll be doing the massage. She replied that she only does reception and no massages (I tried to convince her to make an exception but she still said no, lol). I was disappointed as I found her very attractive with a really nice friendly and warm manner. Helen also mentioned that she only works weekends at Choon. I then asked who was available. She said three girls: two Japanese and a Korean. I asked if I could see them and she said sure. First up was Amy. She walks in wearing a tight very short dress and had a warm and cute smile. Gorgeous looking with delicious long slender legs. Next was another Japanese girl who's name I can't recall but her looks didn't appeal to me. The third girl was Korean. Tall, slim, fair and quite attractive. Her name was Lisa. However, her smile seemed forced and her manner a bit cold so I wasn't keen. Helen (the reception girl) came back in and I said that I'd like to pick Amy. Helen replied that Amy does massage only (ie no HJ or nude) but that I could have her for the first 30mins and a different girl for the next 30mins. I momentarily contemplated Lisa (the Korean) but decided that she seemed too cool for my liking (I follow my gut instincts which tend to be correct). I again asked Helen if she would do the massage with a HJ but she once again declined. Amy looked really pretty and seemed warm so I though stuff it, I'll take a massage with a pretty girl and hope to convince her to do more or at least allow me to diy. So I said to Helen that I'd take a straight massage from Amy and finish myself off at the end (assuming Amy would allow). Helen then went to get Lisa... next there was a knock on the door but rather than Lisa it was Helen again. Helen suggested to let Amy do the massage and that for $20 extra she would come and finish me off with a HJ (ie $65 for the massage plus $20 extra). She had a big smile on her face and a sparkle in her eye as she asked and I said yes in an instant. Out went Helen and the next knock on the door was Lisa. She commenced a great massage (not that I really wanted a 'massage', lol). I declined the cover of the towel, which she was fine with. I asked politely if she might do a HJ but she said no. I asked if she was ok if I did a bit of diy and she just smirked at me. We engaged in some casual chit chat. Quite a shy girl in many ways. Has only been in Australia for four months and has only been with the shop a week (said she only works Sundays). All up a very good massage but she kept well away from any sensitive areas with zero tackle tickle etc. Amy said that she had done formal massage training in Japan, which I fully believe. She was very attractive so I initiated the flip after about 10 mins so I could gaze at her hot figure and sexy legs (didn't want to remain face down, lol). Her looks turned me on and that alone got me hard. She didn't mind me doing a little diy and seemed to like watching (a further turn on for me). After around another 20-25 mins I asked Lisa to pop out and see if Helen might come in to finish me off. Helen arrived with a smile on her face and it was straight down to business... I asked if she would do nude but she said declined. She commenced an amazing long, sensual and erotic HJ. This girl had great technique (plus I gave her some guidance) and seemed to enjoy what she was doing. I tried to rub her a little outside of her clothes but she initially resisted, though as the HJ progressed she didn't seem to mind me rubbing her bum. I engaged in some little dirty talk with her which she seemed to enjoy. Lots of smiles and eye contact as she worked her soft hands on my hard shaft and balls. She was really into giving me a HJ which turned me on even more. Finally, as time-up was nearing, I asked her to work my cock a bit faster before I shot off my load. She then went and got some hot towels for the clean up.

To sum up it was an interesting and enjoyable punt... great proper legit massage from a young, slim and hot Japanese girl. But alas could not convince her to offer more (but she did seem to enjoy watching a bit of diy). How she'll survive in a rnt shop by doing only straight massages and no extras I'm not sure. But as eye candy I found her quite gorgeous (nude I'm sure she would look amazing). The hj finish from Helen was perfect, one of the best I've had in a long time. Pretty girl who enjoyed what she was doing and was eager to please (notwithstanding no nude). If I was staying in Sydney I would go back for sure to see if I could eventually entice Helen to offer more.

Person's Name : Vivian 

Establishment : cho on

Date of Visit : Sunday, a few back

Rates : $40 for 30 mins plus

Age : 40s

Size/shape : 12 ish

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : good enough but not good enough to return

My experience/comments : Very hot day, I had worked the morning and had finished for the day. Went for a walk and as I neared Haymarket I recalled reading reviews of this place. Walked up the stairs into a rather dimly lit place. A lady  dressed in red dress with a plunging neckline, a bit older and a bit larger than I'd prefer approached me. She was available and no one else.  Went into the room, ditched my clothes, and lay down. Fortunately it was air conditioned. I asked what her name was. Tricky question I guess because it took some time before she decided on "Vivian". I asked for a soft massage and she gently ran her fingers across my body in a sensual way. Good enough and the time passed quickly as I chilled it from my morning's work . Lots of butt work, and she kept plunging her fingers into my crack and increasing stroking my cock. Time for the turn over.  She asked if I wanted a HJ. Her boobs looked good so I asked fora nude HJ. This also must have been a tricky question as she took quite some time before saying OK, with a shy smile. Sensing I was on a role I asked for a further upgrade and again the pause, the shy smile and OK.  Costs were $20 for HJ, $50 for nude HJ. I paid $70 on top of the $40.  Given the forum this is in, I will leave it at that. Bottom line is that it was ok. Afterwards she was keen to exchange phone numbers but I wasn't.

Age : 27 ish

Services Provided : Massage, nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : No/No

My experience/comments : Lucked out getting into Posh at 107 Quay st. "sorry, we busy now"
crap

Figured I'd walk down massage alley (George st Broadway), some search while I walked and settled on this place. Was going to head up to Photara Thai but it was a sticking hot day at 40c. A little hard to find but eventually did and made my way up to the 1st floor. Greeted by a very loud security buzzer on the door an a very unappealing mamasan. fortunately she just runs the place. Asks me how long and I say 45min. I also ask which girls are on today. she says Vic and Alexis, then offers me a linup.

Alexis is seriously unappealing, Vic a bit less so. just enough to stop me from walking. So I pick Vic and hand over the $60. However the room is freaking hot, and I ask the mamasan if there is AC, there is in another room. she moves me there, turns on the AC then fetches Vic.

Vic starts the massage and we don't really get talking, her english is pretty bad. Massage skills aren't crash hot either. I ask about extras making the universal sign and she says "$50 for take off job". which I assume correctly to mean a nude HJ. Fortunately she doesn't make me fetch the $50 mid rub like many MLC do.

HJ is ok, nothing great, neother is she without clothes. but I eventually pop. She tissues me clean and then I get dressed. unlikely to return.

Value for money/recommend? : Yep/Yep

My experience/comments : 
Horny, but I've worn out the carpet at DOS and Posh so figured i'd give this place a go, hasn't been reviewed in ages so it was time for me to TOFTT to see if I could gather any new intel.
Booking was a bit painful as they took ages to respond "darling, we have Fiona, Aysu and Amily. opted to let the mamasan choose between Aysu and Fiona, couldn't see any info on the website about them, but was pretty sure I wasn't after Amily.

Bit of a mistake as Fiona really wasn't my type, looked late 30s and a bit too pro. Attempted to walk. Then it got fucking awkward. She really didn't want to let me walk and asked again. I said no it's ok, I'll leave. Then offered to get another girl. I declined and she went to get one anyway. God. 

Aysu was sent in, much more my type, shy but really happy. Asks if I'd like her, so I say ok. But then more awkwardness when Aysu left with the money and instructed me to nude up. Fiona comes back in to collect her things from around the room, weirdly lucky I hadn't got my kit off yet. Jesus christ. But again re-confirmed my suspicions that I really didn't want her.

Aysu retunes and put the change on the table. Grabs a towel and starts the massage. Aysu's English is excellent and we get along really well. Chat about everything and nothing, she's halfway through a nursing degree and works Tuesdays & Thursdays. Loving this one. Massage is reasonable without being fantastic but there is no hint of any tickle, even with MiniMaid coming to attention pointing downwards between my legs. The towel is generally kept in place. Then at about the 40minute mark she asks the question and lets me know it's $50 for a nude HJ. I accept but remain face down. With a giggle she instructs me to turn over, but not to look.

There isn't much warmup as she lather's her hands in oil and commences the HJ. It's ok, but I'm focused on her now. I find her rather pretty in a Chinese girl next door kind of way. silky smooth skin with near shoulder length hair. Had a good arse on her, but not much up top. It's working for me and I tell her to slow down. She does and comes in close. Her snatch is fully shaved and I'm given good access to everything, but stay away from her downstairs because I detect this is still a business transaction for her. 'OH!' she shouts with surprise as minimaid shoots the swim team 2ft across my belly. It was really loud and I laugh at her reaction, and then we're both laughing.

She cleans me up and gets dressed. I do to while she pops out, leaving the money for the HE and some tips with the change. Not fully sure if I'll be back, but it's good to pay if forward if I decide to. Aysu returns, we hug and then I'm out the door.



Had to add in this little gem from their website:
"Our gorgeous ladies work because they want to and enjoy what they do. our ladies pride themselves on giving a passionate and memorable service. They are self-motivated and goal oriented and just love to tease and love our clients. Our ladies are medically fit so you can enjoy with them without any worries in mind."

That's almost a new signature right there!!! Our ladies are: self-motivated and goal oriented

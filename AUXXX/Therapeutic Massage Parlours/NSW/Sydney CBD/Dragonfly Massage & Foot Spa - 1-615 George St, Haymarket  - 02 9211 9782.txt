Hours of Business : 7 Days 10am till late

Rates : $35/half hour

Age : 40ish perhaps

Size/shape : solid 10

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : Perhaps - perhaps not

My experience/comments : Decided to try this one out at lunchtime.  No report in AXR so might as well TOFT.  Initial signs were good, "open till late" and "couples room" both advertised on shop front.  Went in at 1230, up the stairs - aren't they all  found unattended desk at top of stairs.  After a minute or so papasan appeared and asked if I wanted a massage.  I said yes and he showed me a scrappy menu offering Chinese, Thai or foot with 1/2 and 1 hr rates - looking OK so far.  I suggested 1/2hr Chinese and asked if "special" massage was available. His answer was "aah ..... you want girl massage you".  Yes folks, looking even better now  . Papasan then said "girl running late, you wait, she be here soon, 10 minutes".  I considered bailing but decided to stick with it, silly me .

Sure enough after 10 minutes exactly, massage lady appears up the stairs in jeans and jumper and takes me to a massage room with a curtain for a door and tells me to "get undressed lie on table back in a minute".  I am beginning to notice she seems to be in a bad mood ........... this is starting to head down hill.......... at this stage I reckon even money either way.  Massage lady returns still dressed in street clothes, covers me with towel, climbs on table and starts to give me a very painful massage with her elbows and full body weight, she is still not happy.  After the first 5 minutes I belatedly come to the conclusion this place is legit, I decide to live life to the full and try and survive the next 30 minutes.  Fortunately massage lady - her mood did not encourage conversation or even asking her name - had reasonable English skills so I managed to avoid broken ribs and terminal bruising  .  Unfortunately though her mood was not improved when I had to adjust her massage technique.

After 30 minutes of pummeling - all on my back - ML said "massage finish get dressed" and left me to my own devices.

On my way out I asked Papasan if they offered HE, he looked very doleful and said "no, massage only".

Oh well, at least we know now Pure Massage only at the Dragonfly.

I've been here 3x and really like it but it's legit. Open as late as aromm but cheaper cos its $79 for oil 1 hour. 

Strange thing last time I went there was a French girl judging by her accent. Not asian I mean. Said she learned massage in thailand. Was strange experience but she wasn't too bad - didn't even massage the front though let alone of the mild teasing u get from legit thai oil massage. a nice place tho if you want legit open late.

Thanks for sharing Brother,

I have been wondering if this is a RnT or legit.

But regardless, I probably will never visit as I am a regular at the Chinese restaurant Ming right next door and all the staff know me, no way !

Dragonfly Massage & Foot Spa - 1/615 George St, Haymarket - 02 9211 9782

    Person's Name : Fan

    Date of Visit : 2 December 2013

    Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 1/615 George St Haymarket 9211 9782

    Hours of Business : 7 Days 10am till late

    Rates : $70 hour (plus $10 for oil)

    Age : Early 30's

    Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai / Laos

    Services Provided : Massage

    Value for money/recommend? : Yes

    My experience/comments : 

    I went here specifically to see Fan who is ex Lily's old shop at 88A Hampden. I  got word that Fan was back working again after a break since she left Artarmon earlier in the year and had a short stint working at another place. Now she is working in the city at this place and also at a shop owned by the same people on William st Darlinghurst. This place is upstairs on Level 1. There are many rooms and it is very dark. At least 5 or so but not as many staff. I was greeted by a young chinese guy and I asked for Fan and he told me that she was busy and tried to offer me the other middle aged lady there. I said that I had a booking with Fan and then she came out and greeted me. It was good to see Fan again and she was looking smoking hot as normal. I really like Fan's massage as it is top quality and hard. 

The first half of the massage was without oil which I quite like. Fan knows how to massage and does some great kneeling on my back which feels great. I'm in seventh heaven here and really enjoying the massage. On to the turnover and she does my legs , arms and a nice head massage. I could not see any reason to return to this place apart from the fact that Fan is here. I will return to see her as it is good to keep in touch with quality girls.

My experience/comments : I've been a groupie of Fan's for a while now, when she left Artarmon to work down the southern end of Sydney I was gutted. Thankfully I kept in touch with her and she kept me updated infrequently with her movements and like mentioned above she has indeed found a new home at Dragonfly. 
As have most, I have associated massage with a happy ending but because Fan's technique differs considerably from most and is LEGIT at this store, we have established a special relationship which I do value highly. There is certainly no flirting or chit chat, substantial conversation takes place. Combined with her DEEP tissue massage, it truly makes for a unique experience for me. Be warned if she handles everyone else like she does with me, she may not be your cuppa. Her technique is technical, she listens to my body like no one ever has, finding all the knotted and tight muscles, and then using all of her skill to obliterate them. It is clear that she understands the body at a higher level than most rnt and even legit Thai parlours and it shows. I rarely need to communicate with her if its too painful or not hard enough as I said before, my body does the talking and she responds to it appropriately. Magical. 

I would pick RnT over traditional any day of the week but seeing as I've been tracking Fan [In a non stalker way] and always make time for a visit every 2 months, it must say something right?

Date of reconnaissance: this morning

Staying in Haymarket for work trips now and there are a lot of places to check out and revisit for here. 

2:30am closing time and still legit? I may have to find out and review. That and 429a Pitt Street too but Snow Lotus is so close now (and the newer Shop 9, Irene's).

Sydney is definitely spoilt for choice here

Dragonfly Massage & Foot Spa - 1/615 George St, Haymarket - 02 9211 9782

Person's Name : Don't remember - didn't make an impression

Establishment : Dragonfly Massage & Foot Spa

Date of Visit : Thursday 28 July 2016

Contact Details/ - Didn't call

Hours of Business : Open till late but didn't open till 10:30am

Rates : Paid $70 for 45

Age : Maybe mid 30's

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : Not really

My experience/comments : Hadn't been to the city for a while and the previous week had been in and noticed the shops on Pitt St around Thai Town and this place on George which looked interesting including advertising the couples room.  Had to return to the city the next week and thought I might try the Dragonfly as I thought I couldn't go wrong and I was interested in finding out about the couples service. - silly me and doubly so as I didn't check the reviews. The girl/lady was nice enough but her wearing jeans didn't encourage me as I like to signal intentions with a bit of a feel of the legs and this is normally well received. She wasn't interested in me touching her. Anyway massage was pretty good and eventually she said you want more time and seemed to indicate front massage. Silly me again. She said $20 for 10 and $40 for 20 so went with  the $40. Anyway that didn't lead anywhere and was finished quicker than I would have thought and then it was a matter, in not so many words - that's it bugger off. I indicated I was not happy as it was less than one hour since I had walked through the front door and there was a fair bit of waiting involved - talk to the boss she said. I talked to the boss and it ended up being put off as 'there must have been some confusion' and I paid another 20. So $90 for about 50 minutes and no relief. Won't be back but headed off to Pitt Street and after a recon run decided on the Silver Fox which I am pleased to say involved a much happier ending.

Address: 615-617 George St CBD

Hours of Business : 10am to 2:30am

Rates : $70+60 Nude RnT + Body slide

Age : 20's

Size/shape : Slim, trimmed, D cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Taiwan

Services Provided : Nude RnT limited BtB

Value for money/recommend? : Maybe

My experience/comments : Four years since I have been to this place, intel now suggests this place is RnT so thought I would TOFTT and report back.  Walked in without a booking, up the stairs, looks like some remodeling has been done to reception.  Anyway all looks pretty clean and tidy.  Young Mamasan behind desk who asks if I would like a massage.  I nominate 1 hour and Mamasan points to the price list and quotes $70, she pauses for a nanosecond then asks would I like happy ending and nude body to body and quotes $130 for this service.  I guess this is $10 more than the standard $50 for nude RnT, decided to agree and see how we go.

Mamasan takes me to a room - smaller than I remember, none the less, nicely fitted out and clean with a fresh cover on the massage table.  I strip off as instructed and Sasha comes in just as I finish.  Sasha who is a pretty little thing is wearing a skimpy sailor outfit.  Onto the table and Sasha climbs on top, sits on my bum (she is wearing skimpy panties) and commences a light kneading massage.  I try to have a chat with Sasha, her English seems quite good, somewhat reserved/quiet, tells me she is from Taiwan.  After perhaps 15 min she gets the oil and we have a nice smooth oil massage on my back that slowly progresses to rather nice reach through TT.  At the half way point Sasha gets me to turn over and puts a pillow under my head. Sasha now strips off, lovely tight body, nice D cups with large dark nipples and aureola. Sasha does a little thigh, chest and stomach massage leading into a HJ with lots of teasing. The body to body was very limited - a couple of minutes only of Sasha lightly rubbing her breasts on my chest. Limited touching was OK but pussy was off limits which of course I respected.  For interest I asked re extras, Sasha was a little hesitant then offered BJ for an extra 50 and FS 100.  I thanked her but stuck with the HJ as this could have got quite expensive and she clearly was not into getting too close. HJ was OK but nothing special.   After initial cleanup with tissues, I took the offered option of a shower which is at the far end of the corridor.  Shower was nice and clean.  Waking back up the corridor after my shower I noticed in some of the rooms the massage tables were made up as beds so clearly some of the girls sleep here.

Sasha and Mamasan were waiting for me in reception, picked up a business card, said goodby and out the door at the 75 min mark so I got a full hour on the massage table.

Summary
I was offered Nude Rnt, BJ and FSNicely set up and cleanCould get expensiveSasha fairly reserved for first session, might change with familiarityWIR? Upon reflection, while it was OK, there was nothing special to entice me to return.

Person's Name : Emma

Establishment : Dragonfly Massage

Date of Visit : September 2018

Phone: 02 9280 1239 or 0422 996 671

Address: 615-617 George St CBD

Weblink: Haymarket Erotic Massage Sydney CBD | Dragonfly Massage

Hours of Business : 10am to 2:30am

Rates : $70+60 Nude RnT + Body slide

Age : 26's

Size/shape : Slim, Size 8, B cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Hongkong

Services Provided :  RnT limited BtB, limited GFE

Value for money/recommend? : 

My experience/comments : Thought I would go back to try another girl and see what they were like.  I checked the roster and Sasha wasn't on.  Turned up without a booking mamasan behind desk took my $130 and stamped my frequent massage card (in theory I get the 11th massage free) and into a different room to last time.  I took more notice this time and the fit-out has definitely been altered with quite a few small massage rooms - suspect they may have divided the existing rooms in half and filled in the large waiting area that used to front onto George St.

Once in the room mamasan tells me to take off all clothes and girl be along soon.  I follow instructions and after perhaps 5 min Emma comes in.  Emma seems very friendly, introduces herself, we have a bit of a chat then she asks me to assume the position on the table and away we go, initially an oil free kneading massage then a really good oil massage.  Emma's massage was excellent - suggest she has has professional massage training at some stage.  Quite early on Emma introduced some very nice inner thigh and bum massage and then ever so slowly and gently ramped up the TT and crack component.  Emma was very good at this, one of the best in my view.    After a while Emma takes a break and goes out for hot wet towel to wipe oil off my back and legs.  Up to this point, Emma has been fully clothed but she now disrobes (skimpy panties stay on) and leans over to provide some very limited rubbing of her breasts over my back.  Emma is clearly not into body sliding and resumes some comprehensive TT which she is very good at and was really nice.She then asks me to turn over and once I am settled raises the issue of additional extras - surprise, surprise; $50 for CBJ and $100 for FS.  I decided against additional extras so Emma resumed attending to little Ant with her hands.  After a little while Emma hopped on the table (tables are nice and wide), cuddled up and finished of the HJ while kissing me and murmuring sweet nothings in my ear.

Once I had come usual clean up with tissues, wet wipes and hot wet towel, no offer of a shower this time and I didn't ask.

Emma gave me a kiss and a hug before leaving me to get dressed.  Out to reception where Emma was waiting for me then down the stairs on the 65 min mark.

Summary:

    I was offered  BJ and FS extras
    Nicely set up and clean
    Could get expensive
    Emma provides an excellent massage and HJ,she is very friendly and a delight to be with. 
    WIR? For Emma, YES .

Person's Name : Hanna

Establishment : Dragonfly Massage

Date of Visit : May 2019

Phone: 02 9280 1239 or 0422 996 671

Address: 615-617 George St CBD

Weblink: Asian Full Body Massage CBD Sydney | Dragonfly Massage

Hours of Business : 10am to 2:30am

Rates : $70+80 Nude RnT + Body slide + CBJ

Age : 20's

Size/shape : Slim, Size 6, Enhanced C-D cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : MLC

Services Provided : Nude RnT + Body slide + CBJ

Value for money/recommend? :

My experience/comments : I haven't been here for a while. Turned up without a booking mamasan behind desk took my $70 for 1 hour and took me through to one of the room.  I kept my distance from Mamasan as she was rugged up, was clutching a hot water bottle and did not look well . 

Once in the room, as expected, Mamasan tells me to take off all clothes and girl be along soon. I follow instructions and after perhaps 5 min Hanna comes in. Hanna was quite flirty and gave me a cuddle and fondle before suggesting I should assume the position on the table.  I asked re extras and we agreed after some haggling on $80  (she wanted $110, 60+50 to start with) for nude + body slide + CBJ.  Nice wide table with fresh clean disposable cover. initially an oil free kneading massage through a light drape then an average oil massage. Hanna spent a lot of time on my back and neck, some on my legs and very limited on bum and reach though TT.  At about the 30 min point, Hanna calls a halt and goes out for hot wet towel, returns and cleans the oil off then strips off and climbs on board for a body slide.  Pretty average effort and her enhanced breasts put me off a bit.  After perhaps 5 min of body sliding, Hanna gets off and asks me to turn over.  Hanna provided a somewhat perfunctory front massage while keeping out of reach, she then produces a condom, rolls it on with her mouth and gives me a reasonable CBJ, not perfect as I felt teeth at times . I did note Hanna continued to keep well out of reach while she was giving me the BJ.  When I came, Hanna didn't wait for me to finish, whipped the condom off  and started cleaning me up in a hurry.  I thought we must have been out of time but no, we had about 10 min to spare during which Hanna gave me a nice head massage.

Very limited clean-up, out of the room, past the "sick" Mamasan  laying down under a blanket in reception and out in the street on the 60 min mark.

Summary:

Nicely set up and cleanAverage serviceWIR for Hanna?  Not particularly, nothing special

Props on negotiating down on the CBJ. Any idea on where the $60 vs standard $50 comes from for what I assume is the basic nude RnT? Or do they price in the body slide?

No idea re the 60 vs 50 and yes that was for nude+HJ.  I guess the girls can try for any $ figure they wish.  Up to the punter to pay, haggle or leave.  The tip $ I am happy to pay in Sydney CBD shops are are 30/50/80/100 for HJ/Nude/BJ/FS.

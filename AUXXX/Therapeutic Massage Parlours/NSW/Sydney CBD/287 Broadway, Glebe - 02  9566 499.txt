My experience/comments : 

I think her name was Kim, she said she is from Germany and is here studying, really cant provide much more than that as ive only seen her once, she is slim, about 5'7 long blonde hair and fair skin, wouldnt get her clothes off so cant describe any more than that.

Went here for a massage about 2 weeks ago. Must say worst massage  experience i ever had and not cheap either. They open late till around  9pm, walked in expecting asian but to my surprise found a caucasion. Ok  give her a go, the whole place is dark and the massage tables are in an  underground room, almost like a dungeon. Her so called massage was just  lightly running hands over my back, she gave me a massage oil bath, i  think she used the whole bottle.

$50 for this service and another $30  for a handjob which she didnt look like she wanted to do so i declined.  0/10 from me

New management here, who made an extremely half-assed attempt to freshen the place up.
Towels were moist and looked dirty, filthy broken futon as their reception area, it's just a complete dump covered by a very minimal amount of fresh paint.
No comment on the girls, but they are completely untrained as you can tell from the above posts. Many better places to spend your money in the area.

I hope you told them what you thought, especially about the moist towels. Did you participate or did you walk?

I partook, but at the end I was far more interested in getting the heck out than having a candid chat with mama or papasan, who remained hidden (presumably upstairs?) the entire time.

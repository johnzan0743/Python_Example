Post Content: 
Location: Next to Hotel Exotica

Address: 382 Pitt Street, Sydney CBD

Open: 10am-8pm 7 days.

Name of girl: Rebecca

Nationality: Chinese

Age: 23 (I asked)

$65 on walk in and $50 for the turnover for 60 mins

Service: massage and HJ

Walked up the stairs and the receptionist walks me up more stairs to a cubicle after collecting the $65.  Rebecca walks in wearing a pink party dress and starts the massage. My hand slides up her dress and she agrees to $50 for a nude massage and HJ. Off comes the dress and she has a uncut body built for sin. Wearing a matching bra and gstring. Her attitude was good.

The massage was nothing spectacular but the HJ was good. I'll go back.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Up the usual stairs to reception girl who collected $70 then ushered me up many many more stairs to a row of small cubicles with solid doors.  No shower however toilets are available. Told to wait - girl be along soon.  After 5 min or so Sarah walks in with big smile and hello hug.  Another $50 secures nude.  Undress and onto the table which is covered with a red cloth cover which is changed after each client (I asked and observed after my session).

Sarah gave an excellent massage with lots of TT and crack massage.  On the roll over nice sensual chest and stomach massage then competent HJ.  Offered 10 min extra massage for the full hour then hot towel rub down.  Sarah tidied up the room gave me a goodby hug then left me to my own devices to get dressed and out the door.

I reckon VFM.  Only one minus - no shower combined with plenty of oil used.  Left feeling a bit oily.

Person's Name : Anni

Date of Visit : 22/10/13

Rates : $70 1hr. $50 Nude RnT

Age : 24?

Size/shape : 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Nude RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Hell No

My experience/comments : So I was positive on walking out that this place was at 380 Pitt, but it must be the same place. I was actually meaning to go to Silver Fox but walked up the wrong stairway as it's only 10m away. I was about to return downstairs when I realised, but then the reception girl appeared and she was F'ng hot. I assumed she was a massage girl, and by the time I figured it out, I decided to try the place out anyway.

Lead upstairs to the little rooms, and eventually a massage girl came in. I was pleasantly suprised, she was also quite attractive. But this was when the MINUS 5 Star massage commenced.

Firstly, i deduct 1 star for the massage. It was probably the worst massage I have ever had in my life. Completely devoid of anything except the same 2 motions repeated for 15 minutes. No pressure, but not light enough to be seductive. Just boring at hell

Deduct Star 2 for the "sensual" part of the massage. You know, the tickle and tease. Crapola. So much so, that when I turned over, I was completely soft, which is probably the first time ever for me.

Deduct Star 3 for the naked part. While she took her clothes off, she stood there like a stone statue. She wouldn't even let me see the kitty kat, let alonge get anywhere near it.

Deduct Star 4, for the tug. The worst tug in the history of man. i had to close my eyes and think of other naked girls to finally get hard, and then to finish off.

Deduct Start 5, for the cleanup. The worst towel down in my life. She took like 3 seconds and was done. Not even any kind of massage to finish off, just clean up (with like 1/2 a box of tissues first) then a 3 second wet towel down, and all done.

Would I return?? never!

Oh, and she claimed to have worked there for a year.

Hi there,

I have not tried this shop but did check it out once before!

I didn't like the fact that you have to pay the receptionist the massage money first before you were taken upstairs to the massage rooms, no meeting of MLs first - no bloody way !

I turned around and walked - back to Silver Fox to see my girl Lisa.......lol

Cheers

Person's Name : CiCi

Establishment : City Massage

Date of Visit : 23 October 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0406 011 111

Hours of Business : 10AM to 8PM 7 Days

Rates : 45 half hr + 50 nude HJ and body slide (20 HJ only)

Age : 20s

Size/shape : Medium size 8 C+

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Nude RnT Body slide

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : After this weeks triple fail, I thought "where can I go for a guaranteed 30 min RnT"?  "I know 382 Pitt".  This place is sufficiently grungy it has to be a winner for a short time, no questions asked RnT 

Up the usual stairs to reception girl who collected $45 then ushered me up many many more stairs to the row of small cubicles with solid doors. No shower offered. Told to wait - girl be along soon. After 5 min or so CiCi walks in with big smile and hello.  $50 secures nude, body slide and tug.

Undress and onto the table which is covered with a red cloth cover which is changed after each client (I observed after my session).

CiCi launched straight into nude "raunch"  lots of bum crack action and TT right from the start.  Great body sliding on my back and more once I had rolled over.  I wonder if she could read the failed RnT's in my eyes?  Very nice tug with lots of external anal stimulation.  Good eye contact and enthusiastic.

Forget the massage, this was pure sexual stimulation and tug, just what I needed.

A hot towel rub down finish then CiCi tidied up the room and left me to find my own way out

I reckon VFM.

Last Sunday I had some free time and I thought I would go to Silver Fox but it was full and there was a long wait - please hurry up you lot and stopping hogging the lovely ladies.

As I walked along past Silver Fox and a couple of shops down Pitt Street there was a bottle shop and next to it was some new signage promoting massage. Nothing ventured nothing gained so up the very long steps into a rather garishly decorated reception and I immediately thought Chinese massage . A young plumpish asian reception with handbag then came and said you want massage and after a reply in the positive took me up more stairs, then more stairs to what appeared to be the attic with a row of cubicle doors. The old floor boards were bare in the corridor and in the rooms. The rooms were bare with some silk hung from the ceiling above the massage table. I was told to wait and a ML would come in.
Then after about 5 mins this 5ft 6ins indian looking lady in tight red dress came in and said $70 hour.
I passed over the money and made myself ready. After a brief introduction she said her name was ".......long pause ...........Annie" obviously she had forgotten her nome du guerre for this shop.
I found out after a a few minutes and using very simple English that she was actually from Bangkok ( so she said) but she was Thai and her English was very poor as was her massage which was all oil and feathery bored rub. She did however work here 3 days a week and had done this for 8 months I tried my usual patter but it was like pulling teeth she was not one for talking. I however did find out that this shop had been in operation for three years ( I do not believe) and that it was all Thai ( i do not believe).
After the turnover and still dressed she asked if I wanted a HJ and Nude HJ for $50. After agreeing she required me to get up and go get her the money before starting the evil deed, obviously she had been burned by people not paying - or more probably not wanting to pay after the event.
The tug was as bad as the massage and was at full arms distance so nothing was accessible.
After the deed was done she rubbed my back with a wet towel and then left. I then put on my clothes and then left unescorted off the premises. I past a toilet on the way down which did not have any bin for the used toilet paper next to the loo so I thought this is not Thai. There was a sign discreet exit so I followed it in a back alley way and then out onto the road.

I have had some poor massages in my time but I have never had one from someone so rude or unwilling to do the merest part of her job, or with such lack of charm that I will not be returning.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but forewarned is fore armed and if Silver Fox is busy - go and have a beer or coffee until they are free, or goto one of the other excellent shops in the area.

I walk past this place all the time and can confirm that this place is newish. It has been there for about a few months. It was an adult shop before it became a massage place. Haven't been inside but thought it was a legit shop before.

Person's Name : NarNar

Date of Visit :14 July 2014

Establishment : City Massage

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0406 011 111

Hours of Business : 10AM to 8PM 7 Days

Rates : $70 1hr. $50 Nude RnT

Age : 30s I reckon

Size/shape :Slim B cup Size 7 (guess)

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : Nude RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Walked in about 8PM.  Usual trek up the stairs, girl at the counter takes your money and shows you into one of the small rooms - "you wait, girl be along soon".  10 min later girl comes in.  Her name is NarNar - not sure re spelling.   NarNar is happy to take $50 for nude plus tug.

Clothes off at start of massage and a very nice slow sensual massage with lots of oil, TT and bum attention.  Very nice   At half time roll over where the slow sensual action continues.  No touching limits and I reciprocate with slow sensual stroking and fondling with no sign of complaint from NarNar.  Excellent tug. And then we start the clean up with a cold wet hand towel   Not much fun and I had to send NarNar out for several replacement towels to get to the clothes back on point.

On leaving NarNar insisted I exit via the back door which leads into a lane way ........... not a real good idea at night, I assume this was because they had closed for the night and had locked the front door.

I only been here twice and it was so bad both times I don't want to go back. The shop has been there maybe 18 month and the MLs I saw were chinese. There are 3 shop here on Pitt plus a new one up the escalator I haven't tried (may be legit) and the old Chicago which is expensive and also mouldy

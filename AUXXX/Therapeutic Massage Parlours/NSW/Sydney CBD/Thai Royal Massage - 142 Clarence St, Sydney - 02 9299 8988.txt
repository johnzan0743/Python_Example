Was in the city a few weekends ago, walking down Clarence Street and noticed this place  open. Web site is www.thairoyalmassage.com, which looks about as 'legit' as many massage places where they offer both real massage as well as extras.

Listed price start at $39 for 30 minutes of 'traditional Thai massage', then $59 and $89 for 60m and 90m.

Sign out the front calls it 'Best massage in the city', so interested for any AXR folk who might have visited and can validate or refute that call (although we do tend to have a more specific definition of 'best massage' compared to the non-punting population).

i walked past and dropped by today on the way to the apple store.. it is legit as they come.. it is massage in the traditional thai sense.. yoga, acupressure and swedish and remedial massage.. all the girls are in uniform and traditional wear..

very good massage and service.. washing of the feet at the beginning and warm towels and tea after.. 

my neck and frozen shoulder was loosened after..

great place and reccommend to those in the city if you have any aliments and pain.. 

paid $45/30 swedish massage..

so no "hanky panky" in even mentioned!

Hiya Flyboy

Been there and a massage with one of the ladies there - can't remmber her name - good massage, best in Sydney I reckon depneds on the girl - no extras offered or avaliable...I think the oil massage was $79 for an hour. Think this place is legit

The girl I had was very pretty and I reckon would have been great naked - early 20s with a nice tight little bod.

Shame as happy ending would have been a great finish

Thai Royal Massage is definitely legit.. 

it actually is quite a good place to unwind.. the only thing i have a worry with is the scents they use on the pillows.. my sense of smell is quiet sensitive and the aroma sticks are quite strong.. but apart from that i would recommend the place for sure..

There's another place up/down the road a couple of hundred metres, so not sure whether they are connected or not. Look like similar style shops.

I went one evening after work and welcomed in and asked to take shoes off and the woman washed my feet. Placed my shoes near the counter, so I couldn't run away without paying.
All very ambient inside with water feature and soft music. Very tradiional Thai joint. Told to leave underpants on, so I knew it was straight from that point on.
The girl was friendly enough and gave a pretty good massage, though I still ended up with a sore neck from lying down on the mattress on the floor on my front and not placing my head correctly. I do wish they would remind me of these things, but I also wanted to talk a little bit with her - usual chit chat about where in Thailand she was from, how long been here, living here or studying here, etc.
Concentrated on my back and shoulders and gave my head a bit of a massage at the end. Pleasant enough and when I left they offered tea or water. The receptionist was a bit older and friendly also.


Would I return: probably not. I find the Thai joints a little expensive as they add a significant premium for oil, whereas I think this should be standard.

This is my regular massage joint and yeah its 100% legit.

There are a couple of girls there who ask you to take of your undies and on the flip must have seen the upright soldior but they ignore and are very professional.

Have left this place a few times so worked up it was straight over to wishway for a release.

I go here regularly as well, usually once a week.
It's all legit - I see a girl that gives me a great firm massage - usually walk out with a massive hard on that needs fixing elsewhere.
Great service, tea before and after - traditional Thai. Never a hint of anything else, even after you have been seeing a girl regularly.

They have opened up another branch a few doors up next door to Clarence street cycles.. It is actually underground and tbh much better as it blocks the traffic noise out.. It is called grand royal Thai.. Dropped by Thursday and it was the same great service and massage.. Full legit.. Well worth the time.. Actually bought some book gift vouchers for the better half.. As a present..

God bless AXR! Was up this end of the city today, walked past the sign for this place and the thought struck me that a nice Thai massage with a happy ending might be a nice way to end the day... 

But knowing some of these city massage places are botheringly legit, I dialed up AXR on my iPhone (using the Tapatalk app, very worthwhile for peripatetic punters) and discovered that this is among the 100% legit shops.

Would have been worth a visit for the massage alone but disappointing if one was seeking more - so, some time and money saved thanks to AXR!

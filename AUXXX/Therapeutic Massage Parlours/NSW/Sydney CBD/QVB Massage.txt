Fellow punters,

while walking past Tang on Clarance st at lunch i noticed a new sign out the front for QVB massage.

website is QVB massage | Your best choice!

from the website there is no way this is legit so could looks like there are now options an level 1 or level 2 at 199 clarance.

Review will follow next month when i get some more coin in my pocket.

Hi Mate, no need to wonder, QVB is one of my favourite shops.

Here is one of my older review on Lisa, 

*******************************

Lisa is a great masseuse and I almost forgotten how good is her part 1 !!

BTW, this session today is my forth shot in 6 days!!

Friday: Mia 36 D Cups at Bondi Junction

Saturday: Eva 37 E Cups at shop 9, 741

Tuesday: Mia 38 DD Cups (haha, they are the same tits from Friday but just following the same size posted by the shop!) at Snow Lotus

Wednesday: Lisa 35 C Cups @ QVB Massage

It's great when Sportsbet is sponsoring my massages !

The fact is I just completed a big project and submitted my assignment this morning so I have to reward myself with a Lisa session - well the shop was cloest to the CBRE building !

Got there 15 min late but Lisa greeted me with a big hug and a long long kiss anyway. we are so familiar with each other, we just moved seamlessly into one of the middle room, paid the dues and got naked and on to the massage table.

We usually have a nice chat from the word go but QVB's room walls are not fully enclosed, so I didn't want to share my conversations with other people, so no talking today, just a very professional masseuse doing her best:

Firstly pressure points pressing over the towel. In my last few sessions with Lisa, we had been mucking around too much and I was always so horny - a couple of times we did the part 2 first or no part 1 at all, so today was a rare occasion when Lisa was able to give me a proper massage, gee, that feels so good. As a matter of fact, I didn't have any proper massage during my two sessions with Mia. Eva did give me a strong one and her back walking was the high light but because Lisa knows me and my body so well, (she did a few sessions with me during my back/waist pain periods,) so she knows her way around me and knows exactly where to go, what I need and how to do it !!

When the towel bit is done, she moved to the head of the table and gave me the neck and shoulder with just a touch of oil. Then she started pushing down the spine and gave me the Lisa signature move: - both hands stretched right out and press down from my head down the spine down the waist over the butt, between the crack and ended with just a touch of rimming - and while Lisa had to stretch all the way out, her full bossoms were pressind down to my head then on to the back of my neck and further. On the way back up, Lisa's hands were pressing in along the outsides of my upper back and pulling back with lots of pressure. I really liked this move - it was one of the set moves I showed to Lisa when I first met her and she had since adapted it so well, that it became her own moves.

When the top and the back is finished, Lisa moved down to the bottom section and started her other signature moves - sorry guys, ran out of time, from here on its X rated, but I am too tired to write too much, so use your imaginations OK! or you can read my old reviews on Lisa when she was at Silver Fox............lol

On the way out, saw Candy and one other Korean girl in the shop, young girl, didn't ask her name, slim body type, should be popular. Candy gave me a hug and thank me for coming back, and then in typical Candy style, she kissed me behind my ear and asked, are you happy, I said of course I am happy, always very happy when I see Lisa, then Candy reached down to my cock and gave him a little pat and said, and he is happy too. I said, he was very happy and he is now sleeping, don't wake him up!!

No I want to wake him up and I make him happy again, Candy said. No you won't ! I got to get back to work.

Gee I have to see Linda, oh Candy as she is now called, again, she is just so good !!

Cheers




ps. as I was leaving, two other brothers just outside the door pressing the buzzer, lucky bxxxxxxs !!

I think you will find that there are now 2 shops with the name QVB massage. One is on York and the new one is on Clarence.

The new shop's prices seem to suggest it is massage only but who knows.

I have a look at the Clarence St site, their prices are $20 more than the RnT shops, I hope HJ is included.......lol

I think this could be a RnT shop as well, looking at the way the web page is set up, there is one page for the girls, that usually don't happen in legit shops! Also in one if the room photo, I saw a vertical mirror located in a position to watch the ML's body, if she is not gonna be naked, why the mirror !!

May need to check it out some time soon!

Cheers

Person's Name: Karo

Establishment : QVB Massage

Contact Details/Address lv1 as above Clarance St Shop

Hours of Business:

Prices: $50 for 30 minute massage

Age: early 20s

Size/shape: 5'7" tall

Nationality or Ethnicity: Czech??

Services:massage only

Value for money/recommend?: ???

Well i finally visited this new place on Clarence St. This place is newly opened but has one of the wort fit outs i have ever seen. a great sign of a RT joint.

was greeted in the room by Karo a chez red head who was quite cute. stripped down naked and lay on the floor. the rooms have a step up into them and then its just a mattress on the floor.

As it was first visit opted for the 30 min japanese massage $50. there is also a $40 remedial option for 30 mins. massage could only be described as average with the one highlight a full length hot towl session at the end of the massage.

no leg massage, no flip thank you that's it.

I will hold my doubts on this place however for the following reasons.

Dodgy fit out
tissues in room
poor massage

if anyone else wants to TOFT and report back i would be interested to know how you get on

I think the title of this thread is midleading, QVB Massage is more appropriate for use of a different MS directly opposite the QVB on 1B/139 York Street.

This shop is located on the next street down, so people may get confused between the two shops.

I take your point LUNGOR however the link to the address and the website is clearly titled QVB Massage and the contact details as follows :- 

Phone: 02 8964 6064                   Mobile: 0414 475 567

Opening Hours: 10am Â– 8pm, 7 days a week

Email: mooninwater@yahoo.cn

Address: Level 1, 199 Clarence Street, Sydney, NSW, 2000
- See more at: Contact Us | QVB massage

Not certain we can actually rename them as they call themselves QVB Massage Japanese Aromatherapy on their website as well as their signage.

Wholeheartedly agree that it is confusing. However this isn't the first time confusion has occurred especially in the City and no doubt it won't be the last time either. But I must say I did enjoy your review no matter where they are located.

Perhaps a Mod can fix this header.

In the mode of investigation and as I was in the
area went into see what was what.

Got a Japanese lass named My not bad looking, there
was also a cute blond named Dominique - but she was booked.

In the main room they sit you down and you take your shoes off
and put some thongs on your feet. No washing like Grand Thai just
some old thongs. Discussed the price $40 half hour remedial please.
Paid the money and off to the room. Floor to ceiling walks and oil and 
tissues, things are looking up thinks I. Asked to strip and if I would like
tea or water. Neither thank you, My leaves I get my kit off and onto the bed.
She knocks and enters draping the towel over my body.

For the next half a good but not great massage took place without
even a hint of TT. A quick turnover to do the front of my legs and asked
if anything was on offer- no we are not allowed to do that here. 
Finished with a light massage and all done.

From that this a legit shop, first one I have had in a long while. For
the price I'd rather go to Grand Thai....better facilities and massages.
If you want legit that is

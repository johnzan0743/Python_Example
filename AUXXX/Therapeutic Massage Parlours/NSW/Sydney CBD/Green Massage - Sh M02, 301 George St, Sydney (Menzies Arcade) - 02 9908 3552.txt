Post Content: 
Went to what appears to be a sub branch of Green Massage today, Thursday 6 June. 

In the Menzies Arcade, in a tiny shop number M02 on the left hand side as you walk up the arcade from Carrington Street. If entering the arcade from George Street, up two flights of escalators and it is on the right hand side almost at Carrington Street.

Table at reception as you enter and two tiny curtained cubicles disposaable paper sheet on the massage table and at the hole for the head. Massage oil at the ready, no tell tale tissue box. Asked for half hour full body and was looked after by Nina. Late 30's, Chinese, quite good English, about a B cup I'd say but I didnt get to touch or feel. 

Excelllent massage of back, then butt then legs. Went high on inside leg but never touched or teased the goods. Got hot towel, cleaned the oil off, dried me, then said finished and left the room. Did not suggest nor did I get a chance to ask for HJ.   $30 for half an hour.

The main branch of Green Massage is in Hunter Connection, off Pitt Street - not 304/70 Pitt Street as per the banner for this post. 
Mods, suggest it be changed to Hunter Connection and Menzies Arcade, Sydney.

Experience:

I was desperate for a tug but did not want to  go far from work. I had seen this place before and thought I will check it out. Wandered in and was greeted by two mature chinese women ( one was having a snack)I did not have much of a choice since both looked similar in terms of looks or lack of it.

I said 40 minutes and was ushered into a tiny cubicle ( only cloth partitioning) Took off my clothes and the massage started. I have to admit that the woman knew what she was doing and she did ease the tension in the back muscles.
As she prgressed downwards, I made the right noices to make sure that she knew there was more money on offer.Turn over time and the hand job started. It was good and she did show a high degree of enthusiasm, touching my nipples and balls while I came. $20 for the HJ

Woild I go back again? May be - it is good option for a quickie if you are desperate and also close to work.Hygene is probably not top notxh - not sure how many times they change sheets...

Walked past this little hole in the wall shop many times and didn't think much of it. One day a few weeks ago, I noticed a heavy chested chinese milf standing at the door of the shop. This most definitely got my attention and went it to have a look inside. Its a tiny shop, essentially one room, with two cubicles separated by curtains. I book the chinese milf for a 30 minute massage. She lets me into the curtained room and leaves while l get my kit off. She comes back in and turns the little radio up, which is normally a good sign. Keep in mind this place is old, dirty and looks like it belongs in rural china, l'm not expecting much. The massage is surprisingly good and strong, giving my back a good working, not a lot of play down below but sits on my back for some time massaging me.

Flip over and she starts going on the front chest so she is standing at my head. She is rubbing those titties all over my face. I then sit up and she stands in front of me and pulls the twins out. Shes got some kind of tattoo on either her left or right one. I bury my head in there and give them a sound licking over. Shes getting into and l start fingering her very wet, sensitive snatch. I'm now sitting on the side of the bed and she standing in front of me giving me a rapid HJ whilst l suck her tits. I finish up in her hand and on the ground. Definitely not what l was expecting! 

I have now seen her about 3 times and each time is a similar experience. I still haven't got her name but l see her on Thursdays as she says that's the only day she works. There is little signage on the shop either, but it MAY be this one - Gary's Green Therapies Centre

You would be correct my friend. The first time l offered gave her a small tip but that's it. Keep in mind l have established a good relationship with her, and she enjoys me getting her off.

I popped in here on Thursday and almost certainly got the same lady as described above (the description fit to a tee) but was refused any extras. That is the thing about massage places especially ones like these YMMV and the ladies can choose what services they provide or not. Great when you can get it but kind of irritating when you are knocked back.

I used the usual 'a friend recommended me' line. When she knocked me back she said that she and the other lady on shift don't do HJ but to come back a different day- I looked at her like she was full of it (which she was). As we were talking mostly in chinese I explained to her I am pretty sure I was not mistaken. She asked me if I wanted to continue the massage and I said to stop half way through is not polite (on my part) so we finished up, she only charged me $20 for the half hour and apologised. 

I did get her name but I won't say it here as it might be her chinese name rather than the name she uses in the shop.

I tried the place on Thursday too, at opening time, and got a younger, tallish, Chinese lady, Ada.     I asked about extras at the outset and was told no.    There was a older lady there, shortish with slightly darker skin, probably the one mentioned by Slarty.

Ada delivered an acceptable 30 minute massage for $30.    Yes, mileage does vary!

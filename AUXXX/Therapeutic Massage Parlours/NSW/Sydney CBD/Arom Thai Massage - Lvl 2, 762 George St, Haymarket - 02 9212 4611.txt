There are plenty of OK, but not great straight Thai massage places around. A lot of the time, it comes down to luck in finding the one really good massage lady at a place.

This place is near the KFC and the Crocodile Thai restaurant on George St. Walk up to the top of the stairs. They are open 10-10 every day.

But I have had good success at this place. It's the usual $60/hour for massage, no extras. They have curtains between the massage areas, which is usually a good clue. While I've been there I've heard punters come in & try to get extras without success.

But the positive is that the massage can be damn good. If you are sore & feel like having some tiny Thai girl inflict huge pain on your body, this is the place to go. For pleasure go elsewhere :-)

However, be warned, male Thai work here as well. By default, you will get a guy. So always ask for a lady (unless you really don't care).

I have seen Pon (or maybe Porn (no sniggers...)) and Wi (or maybe Weeeeee!), both were very good. There are 7 staff working here at any time. Most seem to work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.

An Asian massage place, down the dodgy end of George Street, up a flight of stairs and open until 10pm. And they don't do extras? Isn't this against the law? I mean, isn't there some international convention which states that a place matching such a description is duty-bound to give extras? :P

Seriously, that end of George Street used to be home to a few Asian and 'regular' places going back a fair while. Always upstairs, always a bit low-rent and dodgy which adds to the appeal. That's where I enjoyed my first BBBJCIM and swallow. Okay it wasn't me doing to BBBJCIM and swallow. It was a red-haired WL, but you get the idea.

Person's Name: Chote (Pronounced like Short)

Establishment : Arom Thai Massage

Date of Visit: 8th May 2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: http://www.aromthaimassage.com.au/

Hours of Business: 10am - 10pm

Rates: They have a few different styles of massage available, so it depends on which one you choose. You can refer to their website: http://www.aromthaimassage.com.au/ma...massage-styles to see the styles and prices. I chose the Remedial Thai Massage which was $70 for an hour.

Age: 29 

Size/shape: N/A as the masseuse is male...

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai

Services Provided: Thai Massage

Value for money/recommend?: 

Today was one of those days I was in the city and needed to kill an hour so I decided to go to Arom Thai Massage (I have been here before). This place is a legitimate Thai Massage place but I was after a legitimate massage. When Chote came in to do the massage I was like "Oh shit!.... a male". I can assure you this was one of those massages I didn't want any extras! As the massage progressed Chote was by far one of the best masseuse I've experienced as he had very good pressure and also recommended for a medium to harder massage as he felt it was the best value for the clients (better for your body apparently). 

If you are looking for a RNT this is not be your place, but if your happy with a Thai Massage this place will do the trick. For those worried about getting a male masseuse.
(I am not a 100% sure but Chote may be the only male masseuse here so the likelihood of you in getting a male masseuse is fairly low).

i have been to this place a few times. and have also heard them turn away people wanting extras. but it's great for a proper massage. open very late too, like 1am or 2 sometimes - but still - no extras even then. they also have a new much nicer branch on hay st nr entertainment ctr but that's not open so late.

I visited this place late on a Friday night mid last November.

I'd been to The Metro with some mates to see The Cruel Sea, and after post gig drinks, we all went our separate ways.

Wandering my way down George Street heading to Central, I came upon this joint and feeling like a little relief, headed up the stairs.

Being a little tipsy (but not drunk or rowdy and stumbling), I just handed over the $100 (I think?) for an hour without asking any questions as to what service was available. The girl behind the counter was young and attractive and given the price and the part of the City I was in, I just assumed that at the very least some hand relief would be on offer.

The girl led me into the room and told me to take my clothes off and lay face down. She returned five minutes later, placed a towel all over and began a hard rub-down. Removing the towel, she then began to give a really good massage. At this point in time, there was no hint of this being anything but a genuine massage i.e. no RnT.

Mid way through I was asked to turn around. She placed a towel over my old fella and kept up the massage. At times she did move quite close which did arouse some excitement. But alas, not close enough and the towel remained on.

After the hour she finished up and left the room.

So in summary: never assume (and it helps to be 100% sober) and ask if you are getting bang for your buck; but, the massage was rally good. The place is very neat and tidy, and in hindsight it's not sup rising that it's totally legit. I can't remember ML's name.

This review for the pure section cos it's just as useful know which shops are legit!

Arom Thai Massage
Level 2, 762 George Street (Haymarket Area)
Sydney NSW 2000
Tel: (02) 9212 4611


Massage Haymarket| Massage Service Haymarket| Massage Therapist Haymarket| Arom Thai Massage and Spa
Hours: 10 am Â– 2 am 7 days

This is a place seems like it would be rnt but is actually a very good legit massage. I have been going there for years and often heard horny brother being kicked out! 

When you go late they charge $100 oil massage which is expensive but very good. Normally $80. 

Generally they ask u to take off underpants but even then not erotic massage. They do come very close to your privates but in the 30 times I've been there I've never had any offer of extras and in fact as I say they don't do that. 

At the moment there is a large girl who works late most night I can't remember her name but she is very good and nice of course doesn't mind if massage makes you horny (!!) 

But no extra even though they know they are teasing you.

Because of the bare staircase and its called a "spa" people might think its rnt like so many other places in Chinatown but all you will get is a really good massage. 

PS the other place near by next to crocodile Thai restaurant is also legit - it's like sports massage expert place. I had amazing massage but from strong man!

Great for the massage, which is main reason I came here for. Needed my legs done, and she is strong, but the massage is good.
Negotiated for the HJ, she is a tough negotiator. BTW, you will have to show fingers unless you speak rudimentary mandarin.
She asked for 30, I tried 20, but she wasn't budging.


The tackle tickle was somewhat limited, seemed almost incidental when working upper legs, but there was some nice butcheek action.
For the HJ, she sat at the base of the table and placed each of my legs over her thighs. Her technique was unusual, but not uncomfortable. She worked me well, the little doctor and the upper thighs, and thar' she blows within almost 4 minutes.


Enjoyable, effective. Would I go back?  To her, now. I did visit a Tiffany there last week, mid 20s and excellent English, but that was for massage only (althoguh I suspect all girls offer extras here).

Dr Bob,  a question about Tiffany who you saw last week. Was she a tall girl? There was a Tiffany there before, but she retired about 2.5yrs ago. I was wondering if she has returned

My experience/comments : 

Had seen this place before in passing, even there website looks legit, but figured i'd try it anyway.
Alas it is, asked for a massage, shown to a very small room. Walls don't quite go up above the door.
So kind of bright and loud, even though I was the only customer.

Was told to leave my underwear on as i got undressed....sigh

Massage turned out to be OK but doubt I'd be back as i prefer a happy ending at the very least from my rubs.

Place was quite quiet as in a lack of customers, not sure how these legit places stay in business.

Massage: Good
Sensual: No
Happy Ending: Does a glass of water count?
Will you go back: No?

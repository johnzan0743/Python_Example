My experience/comments : 

I wasnt really feeling horny today but thought i would have a look at various advertising sites to see if there are any new joints as i always had a keen interest in trying new girls. 

I came across this Tokio Massage on Backpage advertising 100% Jap MLs so that caught my attention to pay them a visit. 

had to call and get their address so i wont put it on here but feel free to call and get it, it is down the Chinatown side. 

Rolled in, nice clean place newly done up, greeted by the receptionist prob early 30s but hot. Then met with my ML Mariko, busty and about 160cm tall, bot slim but not fat either. 

She actually gives a pretty good massage so that was unexpected. 
Then offered $20/50/70 where $70 is NHJ b2b and spanish. Bit pricey so went with $50 just Nhj. 
there is this teasing technique that she used, where i lie on my face and she starting teasing my butthole my balls and my thighs. 

She would grab my thigh and squeeze it hard and release and repeat a few times then i felt my cock twitching. Not a good sign... i was enjoying it but knew shit was going to hit the fan. 
managed to make thru my right leg and she moved onto my left, all out of a sudden i fucking came. 
I came without her even stroking my cock. It was awkward as fuck. 

She hasnt even fucking stripped. She noticed and grabbed tissue for me, i thought.....oh fuck... what next... as this has never happened on me before. 
She began stripping and tried to get me back in the mood but this aint guna really happen with only 5min left so i got up and paid my $50 and left asap. 

I believe the line up is all jap as the receptionist was also a Jap. 

Always on the hunt for tall 170cm+ asian MLs if anyone has any intel please share

I just made a comment on their roster post in the other forum - for a bit of fun really - because they advertised this girl ELLY as 25 yr old and yet stated that she has 10 years experiences in Shiatsu massage - must be started when she was like 15!

I hope that was just a typo........ lol

My experience/comments :  Was in Sydney CBD just prior to Christmas and saw the review of this one. I have a bit of a thing for Japanese girls at the moment and was pleased to find a place advertising Japanese girls that were actually Japanese girls. So rang ahead and booked confirming it'd be a Japanese girl. 

Mariko is an attractive bigger bodied girl with lovely soft C+ boobs. She speaks really good English and has a warm friendly personality. So much so that I wondered if the sensual part of the massage would be any good as she seemed like the girl next door type and they've never put out for me.....

As it turned out she was very accomodating within her limits. I was able to play with her lovely tits and she was up for some Spanish. I then sat on the edge of the table and got her to turn around so I could rub myself against her lovely booty and between her cheeks. This seemed like a turn on for her as well and she really got into it. Which helped me really get into it until I exploded all over her back and bottom. An excellent result.

I'll definitely be paying this place a visit again.

Was back in the city for work, so decided to visit Tokio for a good massage with a cute masseuse. 

I was there relatively early just after they opened, and this was good, as with this venue, they have a sister business that takes care of women's beauty needs so not unusual to have someone having waxing done or nails done. 

Now, this venue is not for all punters. It does not have floor to ceiling walls and so you hear can most of what is happening around the other rooms! So for those who like to stay quiet during the massage then this place is for you. 

Anyway... there were 3 girls on when i arrived. I picked a cute and young looking masseuse who had a pretty skirt and tshirt on. She had lighter and sexy hair. We went in the room and did a quick massage - which IMHO was fantastic and got some good knots out. But i was in a bit of a hurry and there for a more erotic massage. So after 10 i flipped over and agreed the usual $50 extras.  She dropped her clothes asap and started a very slow and sensual massage. She was somewhat shy but I was allowed some touching and we had great conversation throughout. She was ok with a few different positions around the table. After a while she started working a rhythm and it was not long after she was scooping up cupfuls of a mega load... i was horny ok! 

During all this I could hear two lady customers talking in the background - one having a facial and the other out the front waiting for a massage talking to the reception lady!

I've heard some mixed feedback on Tokio Studio but I've always found it to be a good time. Just be warned of the open nature of the space!

This shop shares the same floor with another massage shop Sun City which i think is a chinese shop. So if you are after for chinese girls you take the left shop and if you are after japanese girls you take the right shoo which is tokyo studio.
Have been there twice in recent weeks. Both ocation was shown 3 girls. When the first time i was offered 2 other girls who were both slim and skinny. The second time, i saw a small girl(miku?) and a bigger girl. I chose natsu because i dont like skinny girls with smaller boobs. First time there natsu was wearing a black low cut tank top and a black mini skirt.

Natsu is a next door kind a type. Not overly pretty but still very attractive. She has somewhat innocent teenage look. You can see and feel the youthness in her. I find her a bit shy and reserved. I like her body type. Good size of boobs, biggish aerola with medium size nipples with perfect hardness. Full round ass and shaven pussy.
On my first visit i opted for 45 min, on my return visit i upgradded to 1 hour.. the first visit i got a massage for more than 20 min. The massage was just so so, not really therapeutic. I tried to build up a connection with her from the beginning, initiated the conversation, made her laugh a few times and she got warmed up. Her english is very adequate for conversations.

For part 2 , i got more than i expected. I guess if you treat a girl with respect sometimes you get yourself rewarded well at least in my case. But on my second visit i found her to be colder than the first meeting. Later i found out that she saw me one night walking down on sussex street with my gf. Well thats bad luck for me. I guess it is time to move on. I thought i would made her as my regular since we were click on the first visit.

So if youre after a youngish inexperience japanese girl, i would rexommend her. I think the pict in the ad is really her.

Found myself in the city for work so decided to head back to Tokio. Got there at 1pm as the massage service opened. One fellow punter snuck in just before me and snagged a beautiful young ML I've not seen there before. 

Anyway, Nay was the only other ML on so in the room we went for a 45 minute sesh - first punter of the day for her. Nay has long hair, a flatish face and c-cups, a neatly trimmed triangle down below. She's got some acne scarring all over which is a little bit of a shame but other wise she's cute and it's soon forgotten. I agreed the usual 50 service up front. 

We started with what was a pretty damn good massage. Loads of leg kneading and a forceful hard massage on my back which is want i wanted. After 30 mins it was flip time. Nay stood up stripped, and hopped on the table with me. She oiled me up down below and started a very slow and teasing massage. We changed positions a few times and then she also let me have a go at Spanish. I then gave her a massage for 5 mins before we both stood up and she finished me off while standing up. 

Overall another good experience at Tokio. I've heard some rumours there may be changes happening at Tokio. I hope it's not the case!

Person's Name : Saki

Establishment : Tokio Studio 

Date of Visit : 30th December 2018 

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Level 2, 380 Sussex Street 

Phone : 0431540059

Hours of Business : Weekend 10am-8pm

Rates : $40/$55/$65 

Age : 26

Size/shape : curvy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese 

Services Provided : NHJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, maybe try another girl

My experience/comments : 
Wanted to try out suncity or whatever which is right next door (as i had a hankering for viet girls), one of the girls (natsu) at tokio saw me standing at the suncity door waiting for them to open when i had rung the bell a few times. Natsu advised me they suncity was closed and told me to come here to tokio instead and I agreed.

was put in a room and asked if i wanted a lined up was presented with 3 girls one of them being natsu, but i settled on saki instead as i found her the most appealing, overall the quality of the girls was a bit lacking as they were abit chubbier than my liking. 

saki gave a below average massage and to be honest i don't think i've received a decent one from a japanese girl ever... however the 2nd part made up for it, she is quite shy but game and engaged in light kissing, spanish and likes to use her tongue on my nipples and balls. her handjob is average but i just found she was trying her best and willing to please.

overall she was quite friendly and easy to talk to with her somewhere limited english and shy demeanor. I probably come back but i'll see another girl maybe but if its for a good massage i'll probably pass.

I don't think June runs the the shop now but appears to be business as usual. She has disappeared off the roster and the rosters are updated much earlier than before so someone else is running the place.

Person's Name : Saya

Establishment : Tokio Studio

Date of Visit : October 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As above


Rates : 55/65

Age : mid-late 20s

Size/shape : Short, petite, dark hair and really big eye; super cute smile 

Nationality or Ethnicity : She said Japanese.

Services Provided : NHJ + others on offer 

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, as always

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Was in the area so dropped by Tokio and booked 45 mins straight out with Saya who was at the front desk. Saya is short, petite and hot with friendly eyes and as a I discovered some lovely b cups that respond to light play! 

We went to the first room on the right which is one of the larger ones. I negotiated straight out for NHJ with nude massage from the start for the usual pineapple. 

I stripped and hopped on the bed and she also stripped and started an excellent massage on my back and legs. Most of the MLs here give a great massage. 

Anyway, after 20 mins of blissful massage with some increasingly frequent tickling it was time to turn over. Saya hopped on the bed with me and started a slow massage. Touching was ok and encoraged - she wasn't timid. Saya is quite friendly, has good english and we joked and laughed a bit before things got intense. She had a superb technique using two hands to stimulate and tease. 

Eventually I reached the point of climax and we had time for a brief lie down together. She whispered next time that more could be on offer so I'll be keen to return to see her. 

Tokio Studio is one of my fave massage centres on Sydney - always delivers good quality.  WIR - yes!!

 737 George st Thai Massage and Spa

Anyone been to "Sydney City Thai Massage and Spa" at 737 George St? It's right near the Snow Lotus. Just wondering if it's worth a visit. Looks a bit flasher than Snow Lotus but really don't want to waste my time if it's just massage. Happy to TOFTT if no one has tried it but figured someone must know it.

If you mean the one on the corner above the cooking shop then it is a quality Thai Massage spa with no extras other than all the facial creams and body products that you will need. But do try it out as it is very good. :-)

I had my suspicions that it might be legit but was holding out hope after I walked past it yesterday and a girl gave me a flyer and a seriously flirty smile. Bummer, thought it might have been an rnt with a touch o' class...

Been moving house so I had a pretty sore back, and I was looking for a genuine massage place.
Walked into here.
The chump in me said yes to $90 for a remedial massage.
Kept my underwear on and layed down, and the Thai woman that walked in just whipped them off me and covered me with a towel. Im thinking "ooookkkkkk.... might be in for some extras anyway".
Gave me a great massage from head to toe. Accidentally brushed my nuts maybe twice whilst massaging the hammies.
I turn over and she massaged me again from head to toe, always carefully draping me, but definitely wasnt shying away from the groin zone.
When she started massaging my stomach I barred up, but I didnt have the guts to ask if she would solve the problem for me.
She was very professional and gave a great massage though.
Bebe, or Bibi was her name i think.

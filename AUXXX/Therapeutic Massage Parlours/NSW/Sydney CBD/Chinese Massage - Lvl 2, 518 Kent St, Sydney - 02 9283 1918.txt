9283 1918
30/45/60/90 $40/$50/$60/$90
10am to 8pm

Have seen this place advertised a few times but the earlier closing time hasn't worked for me. That was before I got a call from a nice young ML that used to work at 421/447 King St Newtown - Jenny. Jenny now 'trades' under the name of Celine.

Took up the 60min option (which ended up being extended by another 30 mins).

Celine offers an excellent massage - 9/10. She is a cute young Chinese girl (mid 20's I guess), with a slim build and great shaped b cups. Would rate her looks as a 7/10. But what keeps me keen with Celine is her great personality. Her English is not perfect, but well and truely good enough for a good conversation (and hence me staying for an additional 30 mins).

Celine only works Tues & Fridays. Extras on offer is HJ for $30, and clothes off can be negotiated if you treat her right and compensate her accordingly.

I highly recommend Celine if a good personality is an 'extra' you desire or if you need a quality massage.

Cheers,

BAB

 First Review-518 Kent St CBD
				
Post Content: 
Chinese Massage at 518 kent Street.  Saw their website chinesemassage.com.au  and thought I'd give them a try when in town.  Prices are $35/30min, $50/45min and $60/1hr about par for CBD.

It's a side door next to a French restaurant and up 2 flights of stairs. Door was opened by a Chinese lady looked mid 20's said her name was Angela.  Taken to a good size massage room with table and chair.  I took the 30min option.  Angela was a 7/10 for looks.

Strats with a reasonable massage, of back and legs, no real tackle tickle, so i asked about extras, and was offered $20 for HJ and $50 for full nude +HJ, negotiated $40 for the latter. When she stripped she had a good trim body with a trimmed snatch

A good soft touch massage followed by a decent tug.  She was quite chatty the whole time, and didn't object to my hands roaming including pussy.

haven't tried any other CBD Rn'T shops, but felt this could be one of the better ones.

Yep, this used to be a regular haunt of mine when I worked in the city. It's got a decent location, being a block back (and along) from Town Hall, and open until 8pm if I recall.

Like most such places it can be hit and miss, it all comes down to the girl you get. Most of the ladies there work one or two days per week. If you find a good one, stick with her - ask what days she works and become a regular... this always pays dividends! But phone ahead to book her, because otherwise you can be stuck with whoever answers the door.

My regular deal here, with a few lovely young things I've known, was $100 for one hour - which is $60/hr massage (half of which goes to the girl) plus an extra $40 for her to strip down and have some fun. That rarely went beyond mutual play, bodyslide and some kissing, although sometimes with one girl there was oral and one memorable session included FS as a 'going away' present when the girl was headed back to China with her earnings from a year here.

Mondays and Thursdays sees Kelly ready and all to eager to whisk you away to a fully walled room, with a curtain partitioning a third of it, ostensibly used for storage.  Disrobed, instructed to remove everything, lacklustre massage with no real skill, playful pinching of ears, a slap or two on the bum, minimal tickle tackle til at 30-40min into the hour she requests the turn over.  $20 HJ, $20 clothes off.  Just the first thanks and a cheeky strap flick in full flight and after a grab or two or small A-cuppers under a heavily padded bra I was away.  Good HJ skill but not much on the looks.  Conversation passable, somewhat confected.  Entry not too indiscreet but another lady may be in order next time around.

Contact Details/Address: 518 Kent St Sydney

Hours of Business: close 9pm

Prices: $60/hr

Age: mid 30's Milf

Size/shape: Medium Build, B Cups

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Good Strong massage. HJ was ok but nothing special

Value for money/recommend?: Recommend if you want a decent massage with a happy ending but not if you're looking for a young pretty thing

My experience/comments: Was feeling rather sore on the weekend after some exercise and was genuinely looking for a good strong massage. Strangely, when you're looking for a normal massage it's actually quite difficult to find on a Sunday.

Anyway, walked pass this place and saw the Chinese Massage sign with a big reflexology logo. Thought that this might be legit and decided to enter and went up to the second level. Just as I hit the last flight of stairs before the entrance, I must of set off an internal bell to tell the owners inside someone was approaching.  Thought that this probably wasn't legit after all but I'm up this far and might as well knock on the door.

Was greeted by a Chinese lady in her mid thirties and was ushered into  room out the back. The decor of this place looked pretty old. A bit of 80's decore wih wooden panelling on walls . The room had a proper massage table in the middle and a computer table which i think the massage girls use when business is a bit quiet. 

I wasn't too fussed about girls as I was looking for a massage and took the $60 option for the hour. No shower was offered and she left with my $70 to get change while I got undressed. I wasn't all that attaracted to this lady so I actually left my boxers on which suprised her when she came back and left the $10 on the computer table.

She proceeded with a strong massage all over with oil and 45 mins later started complaining that my boxers were getting in the way and I suggested I take them off. She then proceeded to give the buttocks a good massage and then asked me to turn over. 

At this point she wasn't sure if I was there for a tug and to be honest neither was I, but my bro spoke for me. She pointed and asked if I want a special massage for $20. I didn't have the cash on me so told her I'd pass. She then looked over at the 10 she returned with and said she'd do it for 10. I thought why not for 10 bucks.

She went through the next 10 mins working pretty hard for her 10 bucks and think she might of regretted it. She wouldn't let me touch her but I eventually let my load go.

She brought in some hot towels and wiped me all over to get rid of the oil but didn't get offered a shower. 

WIR - Probably not. The massage was pretty good but can find better places. Wouldn't return for the tug as there are also better places for that.

Here on a Friday night a bit back and with only Kelly available into that room.  A computer set up with music playing and 1/4 of the room screened off with a curtain, probably being used for storage.  A massage of poor quality, then some unexpected singing (?), before roll over and brief negotiation for extra $20 HJ.  Good technique first without any oil, but then worked up to full crescendo with some oiled assistance.  Best to keep the eyes closed while the hands wander a bit.  The job done, clean up with tissues and hot towel, before leaving not to return to Kelly.

Not the best looking girl in the store, there are others, however as I went without a reservation I didnt have much of a choice. Will definitely be back soon to check out some of the others and try and work out which is my favourite and work on getting FS - not sure how much it is gonna cost.

Seriously all Chinese RNT in Sydney is not such a value any more. With most the "old establishment" (1 belmore, Alice in Ashfield) gone or change localtion. The days of getting a good massage and a good service for less than a $100 is almost gone. All these small shops in city and other suburs are full of hit and miss. Over charge for the massge and over charge even more for extra.

massageaddict, I think you are being too pessimistic and generalising.

I love the Thai 6 Poplar chain - the girls are tight good-looking cuties, who provide a great B2B and HJ for $60 / 30mins. By reading this forum you will find plenty of Chinese massage places - typically at $40 / 30 mins plus $20-30 for nude and hj.

It's not as bad as you are painting.  Sydney is the best in Australia.

I mean the Chinese RNT is bad, especially if you has been through the golden days of Belmore 1 and Burwood 8 and Alice at Ashfield. The market today are more expensive and less services (in general). Because all these shops raise their base price and let the girls charge $50 just to take their clothes off. 

And I agree with you the 6 Poplar chain is the place to be now. I go to 429 very often and it is just so much easier and simplier. Pay your $60 and you will almost sure come out a happy man. No need for bargaining and no hit and miss. 

think about it why would I pay $60 in a chinese join and only about to get the girl to strip (sometimes not even allow touching), when I can get a full B2B for the same price in a Thai shop.

512 Kent St is a hit and miss place. I have been coming here on and off for several years now, and you do not get your choice of girl. I think it's whoever is next in line gets the next customer. I usually come here when i want a good massage w/happy ending.

The quality of women varies, sometimes you get young cute ones but sometimes you get the old mama's. Quality of massage is always good, although some are better than others. Almost always get offered happy ending for $20 tip, which i always accept  Here is one experience...

Person's Name: Seline/Celine (?)

Date of Visit: ??/01/11 (was a tuesday) 

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: http://chinesemassage.com.au/

Hours of Business: 9am-9pm (?)

Rates: 35/30mins, 50/45mins, ?/hour (+$20 "tip")

Age: Early to mid 20's?

Size/shape: Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese but spoke good english

Services Provided: Massage + hand relief

Value for money/recommend?: Good value if looking for great massage by cute girl with hand relief

My experience/comments: Got lucky one day when i walked in and was met at the door by a cute Chinese girl by the name of Seline/Celine (Not sure of speling, but for arguments sake im gonna spel it Seline from here on). Opted to take the half hour massage as i havent had her before, so i tend to do this just to test the girls out. Stripped down and lay down on my stomach as Seline asked if i wanted hard or soft. S Opted for medium as Seline gave me a pretty good massage, with a bit of small talk. She spoke pretty good english which was a bonus, as sometimes you get some that dont speak too well. 

After massaging my back and legs, i got a few "accidental" brushes on my balls as she was massaging my upper leg. After rubbing down my back and legs, i was asked to turn over. Needless to say, i was standing to full attention. Selene pretended not to notice as she massaged my stomach and legs, working around my little friend. Eventually, she asked if i was "nasty" while giving a cheeky grin. I replied "sometimes" and she asked if i wanted my little friend massaged too.

Of course i would be a fool not to, so she oiled me up and slowly massaged me. Every now and then she would lean over and breath heavily into my ear, which none of the girls here have done to me before. After slowly massaging me to an excellent climax, she cleaned me up and told me to relax as she got some hot towels to wipe me down.

I asked about extras and from memory it was $20 for handjob, or $50 extra for nude handjob. Made the excuse i didnt have enough for her to take off top.

Excellent experience in a "hit and miss" place, so if you go on a tuesday or Saturday you'll be lucky to run into Seline and it will be a great massage. All the other girls are hit or miss.

Hi LST8881,

I can confirm that her name is spelt Celine. You describe her very well - she is a great looking girl and very friendly. Celine used to work at 421/447 King St Newtown under the name of Jenny.

You have brought me back some great memories...I will have to go and see her again!!

I have seen Celine before & just today. I asked for a headjob & was previously told 'no' but this time she said yes. She asked for $50 & I only had $45 which she accepted. I asked if I could sit in the chair so I could see better & she got on her knees & sucked me good, very skilled, lots of eye contact, spit trails, hard sucking, great dick sucking lips & tongue flicking on the head. BJ was covered but great quality & unrushed. She played with my asshole at the same time too. I held her head while she blew me.

My experience/comments: 

In Sydney for a business trip. Thought I'd check a massage joint I could walk to. Met at the door by tall, pale skinned, slim Chinese ML. Minishorts really showed her great legs.

Anyway usual pleasantries exchanged and shown into clean, fully closed off room with a door. Told to take off all clothes and lie on massage table. Spent $60 for the hour. ML Linda was a really pleasant person with a cheeky attitude. Really good English. Provided excellent massage with oil. Massaged balls from behind. On the turn over she asked if I wanted there massaged as well. I said why not. Asked if she could do nude. She replied $20 for HJ and $50 for nude. I negotiated $50 for the lot. She said I'm cheeky but agreed. 

She jumps on the table and straddles me. Pushes her A cups with nice large nipples into my face and asks me to massage her back. I comply and reach around to play with her arse and nicely shaved va jay jay. She felt great and seemed to like the play. The she asked if I was ready. I gave the nod and she flips around so her arse was in my face and applies oil to the little man. Great tug until I reached a conclusion. Hot towel clean- up and left with a smile on my face.

If you have a chance pop in. Linda was a real joy to be with for the hour and don't be scared off by her age as it was the service that counted this time around.

WIR? Yeah for sure.

Value for money/recommend?: Yep.

On Thursday after i finished work, i thought i "What better way to treat myself to a 5 day weekend than a massage?"
So off i went to 518 Kent St where i havent been for a while. As everyone knows, this place is very hit or miss. Thought i would give it a go as I really wanted a good massage with some relief (if you know what i mean)
So I was greeted by a woman who i would later learn was named Katie. Opted for the 30 min session as i havent had her before. Standard clothes off and lay down. She gave a pretty good massage, often asking if it was ok, too hard, too soft, etc.
When we got to the legs, i got the standard "accidental" brushes in the usual spots, then got asked to turn around. A bit of soft teasing, and she asked if i wanted something else massaged. Of course with my friend standing at full attention i said "yes."
The tug was pretty good. It wasnt mechanical by any means, and when i asked her to slow down and told her some techniques i liked she was more than happy to accommodate me. Because she changed her technique to the way i liked it, i had a massive explosion which she cleaned up as i relaxed.
Would i return? Yes. Although she wasnt a stunner, she wasnt ugly too and seemed friendly enough and eager to please and make me feel good, which is all i ask for 
Her name was Katie and i cant remember what days she works, but i know one of those days is Thursday.

Size/shape: average, A cup, a bit of a tummy but still cute.

Nationality or Ethnicity: China

Services Provided: massage and nude hj

Value for money/recommend?: neutral

My experience/comments: Figured I would try this place out and had an OK time.    Didn't get a choice, Julie(?) answered the door and ushered me to a room.  She was cute but not really pretty, about 5'4 I think, long hair, blunt fringe, cheerful.  Massage wasn't that pro but it still relaxed me, lots of sensual strokes on shoulder blades and round upper leg etc.  She then did the soft brushing...I didn't get the full credit card swipe but it was still nice.  Negotiated $50 for nude hj although that meant leaving her briefs on.  Wasn't too bothered, liked her smallish tits and she did pull down her briefs so I could see her nice pubic hair and mound.  Didn't really touch, a bit of light stroking and nipple tweaking.  She seemed a bit embarrased about getting nude but was laughing about it...
Her technique was nothing amazing, did the job.  I actually came after only a few minutes which is a bit annoying, but the flip side can be where you take too long.  I got a bit more massage after the cleanup which was nice.

All up it was OK but didn't rock my world.  I don't ever go for the half hour option because I enjoy a legit 1 hr massage but I may start doing that so I can do more research.

My experience/comments : I have been to this place a few times now.....I may becoming a regular.  I had Linda and I asked for a sensual massage (I normally go for a hard massage and wait for the extras to be offered.)  I had a great soft massage where I played with Linda ...she stripped to expose the nicest shaved smoo.....lovely.  I continue to caress her to the point that she had THE BIG 'O'.  This really surprised me. After that she finished the massage leaving a smile on my face.  I must admit that I am new to this and really enjoyed the experince. 

As I mentioned this was three months ago .......I have been back numerous times and have seen Linda at least two more times.  She has given me a a couple of really good hard massages and sorted out a bad shoulder. So she has the sensual and hard massages worked out.  As the Governator said "I'll be back".

My experience/comments : I must admit if this place was a pub I would call it my local.  I have been a quite a few times and like what I get.   The place is clean - discrete and has a good variety of girls.  The prices seem to be as good if not better then other places I have read about.  ( I have not been to too many - I plan on going out today to try a new place - review to follow).  Celine is a younger girl slim build with nice legs.  She is shy of her body.  I opted for a massage and a nude HJ to finish.  Celine has a nice shaved pubic region which I just love.   A good amount of touching is allowed which makes for a good time as well.  We moved around for the finish and ended with me standing and Celine milking my member and I blew all over the floor (watch for the damp patch).

It was good value.

Had a few hours to kill in the city yesterday (Saturday) so I thought I would drop in for a massage.
Was greeted at the door by Linda who asked me how long i wanted to stay. Half hour and off I went to the table.

She gave a great relaxing massage and we had a bit of idle chit chat, but I mainly just laid back and enjoyed the massage. She gives a great massage and it was exactly what I needed after a long week at work.

When she finished off the massage, she softly stroked the back of my body and asked me to turn around. I was then asked if I wanted a "happy ending" to which I replied yes  

She proceeded to give me a nice slow handjob with lots of oil, just the way I like it. When we were done, she wiped me down with a towel as we made a bit more idle chit chat. 

Overall, very friendly experience with a great massage. Will definitely be back.

$35 for the half hour, + $20 for the tug.

I was sore after a week of running, so decided to kill 2 birds with 1 stone and head to Chinese at Level 2 Kent.....

They always open the door just before i get to the top of the stairs... and am treated ever so nicely while being shown to a room.

Anyway, i got the older lady here (i never get the young nymphs...are there any??)   Her name was Sofia....  45 mins....  

She gave a so so massage, even after i said to go harder....   and after about 25 mins, she started to do a nice ball massage - very very nice...

Anyway, she asks me to turn over and i do showing the full exocet missile waiting to launch...     She motions for a hanjob and i say yes, of course...

Now, i don't want anymore than this as i paid $50 last time for a julie to take her top off and pull her paints down 8cm...  Not worth it.....

Sofia motions for her top off and HJ for $50  -   I decline and say, no thanks  -  "HJ for $20  is perfect"     -   She acts as if she doesn't understand, followed by the sad dog eyes, followed by the poor pilgrim act...

She finally says, $40 for all off - good service ...   I give in....   Im a  Weak arse - but hope she is keen for a bit more....

THEN    WAIT FOR IT ........

Sofia:   Takes my $40 , takes her top off and then says "no pants, period...."
Me:      Thats fine, take them off as well (calling her bluff)
Sofia:   Me Period
Me:      Me Horny - All ok
Sofia:   Period ?
Me:      Don't care
Sofia:   ok  and takes off clothes... and moves in for the grab and slide...
Me:      Go for the boob touch
Sofia:   (Pulls away)    No touching
Me:      What ? i paid for extra
Sofia:    Only pay $40  -   touching is $50
Me:      That's not right - i am not happy, i got better last time with Julia...
Sofia:    tick tock - brain ticking.
Sofia:    R U Sure ?
Me:      Yes...
Sofia:   mmmmm   she moves closer and grab a handful.
Me:      better
Sofia:   extra for this ???
Me:      No
Sofia:   pulls away  -  extra ?
Me:     Come on !!!
Sofia:  hurry - while covering her boobs and pussy with the other arm (while i am grabbing one then the other.)

I tidy up to leave and feel pretty hard done by.....

Paid $50 for 45 min massage which was crap, along with $40 for a half hearted nakedish HJ from a old massage woman... $90 !

I would avoid this place unless you find someone who looks after you better.

In fact.... I have a proper sports massage where i naked up in the city for $80 (then get a $18 rebate from HCF)  for an hour in a true day spa type experience from a registered massage therapist (Youngish Aussie Girl). $62

Person's Name : Jenny

Establishment : Chinese Massage

Date of Visit : 3 November

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 518 Kent

Rates : $35 hr massage +$50 naked + HJ

Age mid 20s

Size/shape : size 12?

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage, HJ, touching (not pussy)

Value for money/recommend? : perhaps worth it for research purposes only, but you can do better for less

My experience/comments : I dropped in as I was in the area. Jenny answered the door. She is younger than most MLs here.  She had a nervous giggle and her massage skills seemed a bit amateurish.    She offered  naked HJ for $50 extra. Somewhat more than what I wanted to spend - for me you can get a better massage, more raunch and better MLs nearby -say poplar. However I was intrigued as she seemedto be new to the industry so I  made the investment.  Afterwards I asked her how long she had been working there - she said 18 months. She works Thursdays and Fridays

Age : late 20's

Size/shape :   slim & toned

Nationality or Ethnicity :   Korean

Services Provided :   Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? :   no

My experience/comments :     I had visited this place a few times but never been offered anything extra. On one previous occasion about 20 minutes before the end of the session the lady grinned and asked me if I would give her any tips. When I asked her how much she seemed hesitant and carried on with the massage.

  This time about half an hour into the session while I was face down she started blowing into my ear and then working her hands up and down my back. This got my hands roving over her as best I could given the position I was in. After a few minutes she asked me if I wanted any extras. We settled on $20 for a HJ.

  She then seemed to want to rush the whole process as I think I was probably her last appointment for the day. I managed to slow her down for a little while. The rushed ending was annoying and I'll probably stick to the normal massage next time- somewhere else. 

  The quality of the massage here varies so I might stick to some of the thai massage places in the CBD that I've found to provide a very good basic massage.

My experience/comments : It was good value - would prefer a harder massage. 

The massage was very sensual.   She asked if I wanted oil which I like.  She started to drip oil down my crack at the start of the massage.  The massage was very soft more sensual.  She then spent a lot of time massaging my ass and crack which was very nice.  At the turnover the prices above were negotiated and a naked HJ commenced.   This was very nice.  Mei Mei had a great personality and a body to match (minus the tits) she spoke english very well (makes me believe that she is from Singapore).  All in all a great experince the only down side was the massage was lacking.  

As I have mentioned in a previous post this place is my "local" it is good - clean - private - priced right - the girls are normally great - massages are normally good .......what more could you want.

Hi Max,

I also saw Mei Mei today, very sensual, there was not a serious rub anywhere, but very arousing and sensual, I loved it.

Glad I did not pay her to take her red dress off then

Did you get the story about her studying Agriculture so that she can own a Wheat farm in Darwin (none of Thai makes sense).

Works Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

Cheers

Hi Chalk

The red dress was nice to take off.  However I am not an advocate of plastic surgery but in Mei Mei's case I think a little would go a long way.  As I alluded to in my post I go for the massage and everything else is a bonus.  I prefer a hard massage and that was not Meimeis style.  Though I had a great experince and it was well worth it.

take care and have a good one

cheers Max

The Quest - Level 2, 518 Kent St, City

 Onto my third post

 Background - been punting on and off for years, and need to widen my knowledge of the scene.

 The Quest - Get a BBBJ / CIM and / or FS as a value-for-money extra at a cheap Chinese massage shop (probably a bit demanding, but lets see how we go).

Chapter 1 was 107 / 379 Victoria Avenue Chatswood

Chapter 2 was Level 4 / 822 George St, Sydney

Chapter 3 is Level 2, 518 Kent St, Sydney

Jan 2012, Thursday evening. $60 for 1 hour massage

Mid-20's girl, bit chubby, very plainly dressed, didn't do anything to float my boat at all. Older milf appears, seen better days, but reasonable figure, and a good positive teasing attitude. Based on my Chapter 1 experiences at Chatswood, I think I'll try this and see............name was Kelly. 

I jump on the table with towel this time, and the first thing she does is grab the towel and slap my arse - surely a positive. 

She was fine with my preference with soft massage, and this went on for a while, and was just how I liked it, with slow stokes up the legs and towards the danger zone. Started touching her arse and pussy through the jeans, which she was fine with. Went for some inside access, and she stopped me. Damn, looks like the quest will fail again. She eventually offered HJ for $20, and went on with some good touching. Then offered to take the clothes off for a further $30. Before agreeing, I asked if she did other extras eg BJ, BBBJ. No she was adamant that no BJ / Oral Sex or Sex as "too dangerous". So I took this hint and din't fork out another $30 to get the gear off. She finished me off, with my hand rubbing her pussy through jeans, which were so thick, it wouldn't make any difference. So my luck continues to go backwards after what appeared to be false start at Chatswood.

Conclusion To Chapter 3 - Quest not attained. Would not go back to this girl or this shop, as there has to better elsewhere.............surely.......

I saw Mei Mei as well a couple weeks ago on a Wednesday.  Same story, she does alot of playing with the anal and nothing even close to a serious rub.  Was wearing the red dress.

$35 for half hour massage, $50 for a nude hj.  Mei Mei is attractive and speaks english well.  Says she's Singaporean, I wasn't sure at the time because her accent doesn't sound Singaporean.  

When she was nude there was not much going on in the way of body contact, she allowed hands on but not between the legs.

All in all, good location, attractive masseuse and the inevitable draw of assisted relief is going to bring me back to this place however not sure if I'm willing to fork out for the nude part, at least not every time, as legging it a bit further to Thai Oasis on Poplar I think is more for your dollar.

Oddly enough as well, this place has alot of legit looking signage in terms of the rooms, maybe if "normal" customers show up, someone else besides a gorgeous girl with a tiny red dress opens the door.

dropped in to this place for the first time in nearly two years last friday and was met by a cheerful chinese gal by the name of judy.  a few details about judy - 28 years old, a nice smile with average looks, good english   and lives with her parents on the north shore after the family immigrated here three years back. as judy is the first ml i have encountered living with her folks, i asked what do you tell them -- she responded i do massage only.


i opted for 45 minutes of "soft touch" massage. judy's fingers danced my spine with occasional poke between my thighs. she seemed slightly nervous about what was to follow as she attempted to find spots to tickle me. 

turnover time and i was only mildy aroused. usual hand gestures and offer of clothing removal after a few minutes of her moving her hands about everywhere around my crotch -  $40 got her dress and bra off ..................her bra and bikini set was very "teenage" emblazoned with what appeared to be cartoon characters. partially naked, there was nothing to complain about -- nicely proportioned all round.  she did the deed making urging sighs as my excitement grew, but kept her presence out of arms reach.

it was pleasant to spend time with judy, but she didn't inspire a return visit.


fridays only

My experience/comments : ). I had an interesting visit here about a month ago.  I arrived as usual and was shown a room by a nice young chinese girl with a good figure.  I paid her for an hour as I like a good massage (I go for the massage and I read porn Magazines for the articals) I stripped off and got on the table.  The next thing the girl comes back and informs me that the place is being raided.......well I am butt naked on the table thinking this could go bad.  As the raid was from immigration no problems ...then I thought.....shit I did not bring any ID with me.....I then had thoughts of spending a couple of nights locked up at the Villawood detention center.. 

Anyway the girl must have been OK as after about ten minutes she came back and started the massage.......unfortunately I do not remember too much about the massage I was just glad to leave with my freedom.

As I have mentioned in a a couple of previous posts this place is my "local" it is good - clean - private - priced about right - the girls are normally great - massages are normally good .......what more could you want.

ABout 2 weeks ago I had a really bad day at work. What better way to work out the kinks than to go to my favourite hit-n-miss place.This was on a Saturday and was greeted at he door by Vicki.
Vicki I would say is in her mid 20's? She has a nice firm body and remembered me from previous experiences 

I paid the standard $35 for halfhour and stripped down and lay on the table. A bit of idle chit chat while she gave me a good massage.
Sometimes I like to be quiet and just enjoy the massage, and she would occasionally ask "good?" 
As the massage went on, she would do her standard accidental brushes and finished the back massage with some soft and teasing strokes. Time to turn over and I was asked if I wanted "that" massaged. When he is standing up at full mast, of course 
Stock standard $20 tip and Vicki commenced with a nice slow massage. She allowed me to touch her through her clothes and she has nice firm tits. I didnt push my luck with what I was allowed to do, and exploded with a nice squirt.
She cleaned me up and we had a bit more idle chit chat as I got dressed. Very friendly and remembered me from our past experiences so I suppose we had a good rapport. Would definitely come back.
I think she also offers nude for a price, but I cant remember off the top of my head. She works on Saturdays and another day but again, I can't remember what other day she works. Highly recommended if you can get her. I tend to go on Saturday if I am in the city as Linda and her give awesome massages as well as good hand techniques and are very friendly.

My experience/comments : This is my "local" massage joint as its close to work allowing for plenty of lunch time jaunts.
I had a break in the day between appointments and was feeling a bit pent up so decided to head down Kent st and release the tension.
Up the stairs with the familiar doorbell going and was met by a beautiful chinese girl, slim and long long hair with blue contacts and tight jeans.
Sometimes here its very hit and miss with who you get, usually older chinese ML but this time I was thanking my lucky stars with this young tight stunner.
Me Me asked what massage I wanted with a cheeky smile and I opted for the medium massage to start things off.
The massage was average to good, not too much oil and firm pressure which I like.
As she moved down to the thighs she nudged the knees apart and started occasionally brushing my balls and in my ass crack.
Enjoying the change in massage technique, I shifted position to ease access to the nether regions. 
Next I felt oil being dripped onto my asshole and a finger lightly rubbing my asshole whilst she stroked my balls and shaft from underneath, needles to say this had me hard as rock.
Time to turn over she aked whether I wanted HJ or naked HJ, I immediately chose the naked variety which was $50 but I had only $40. She reluctantly agreed to $40 after checking my wallet! Not afraid...
She sexily disrobed revealing a smoking hot lingerie clad body and a very nice bubble butt unusual for a chinese girl. She stayed at the side of the bed at first posing sexily and pushing her ass at me whilst stroking my cock slowly then with some encouragement jumped up n the bed straddling my chest naked.
This allowed a nice view of her tiny asshole and shaved snatch and the view in the side mirror was awesome too.
Eventually some thorough groping of her ass and tits got me over the line and I gave thanks that I had found a new gem to try again.
I will be back, I believe Me Me works Monday, Wednesday and Fridays.

Value for money/recommend? : Very good will see Angela again.

My experience/comments : So after relocating for work I was keen to check out some of the places nearby. After having a quick look on the forum and seeing most of the the recent reviews were positive I thought it would be a good idea to check this place out. I get to the door and am met by Angela, she shows me to a room, asks me how long I want. I decide on half an hour, give her the money ($35) and then undress.
When Angela comes back in she asks me what kind of massage I want (Soft - Medium) then proceeds to rub the tension out of my back and legs. Massage is Ok and she seems to be putting in a bit of effort but the reality is I am not here for the massage so I drift off and relax until I feel her lightly tickling my ass and balls. Time to turn over and then she pops the question "You want me rub this" as she points at my erection. Of course I say yes. She wants to know if I want her naked I agree. Angela has a great body. She is slim with nice c cup boobs and still has hair on her pussy. HJ not that good but with an attractive Asian girl kissing me all over my chest, licking my nipples and for some reason sticking her tongue in to my ear at the same time as me grabing a handful of her ass I come. 

She offers me a shower I decline and go with the handy towels/wetwipe/hot towel option. Angela is great and I will be visiting her again. I did not ask her what days she works but no doubt in the next few months I will be able to post her regular work days.

I needed some fun and this place seems to be fully of nice and pretty ladies with great attitude, so off I went. It is funny how they always open the door before you even have the chance to knock (they have a motion detection system I think)
Angela greeted me with a great smile, and took me to one of the rooms on the right. Rooms are clean, quite large actually and it is not cold. A nice place to receive a massage.

So I undressed and laid down. She asked me if I wanted a soft-medium-hard massage. I told her medium. And she gave me a pretty good massage. Not outstanding, but it is clear that she knows what she is doing. It was quite pleasant and I almost dozed off...

She brought a towel and removed the oil, and then she asked me if I wanted a HJ. She offered a naked HJ but I almost never take unless I know there might be more extras. So she started a brief tackle tickle and then told me to roll over.

And then it happened. In other shops, ladies just simply put some oil and start wanking. No Angela. She started slowly, and now I can say that she gave me the best tug I have ever had in my life. It was slow, incredibly sensual, with the right pressure, the right touches. I remember myself murmuring "Oh, wow" all the time. She smiled at me all the time, she looked me in the eye... A fantastic tug. Of course, it didn't take long for me to explode.

She cleaned me up, gave me another towel. I gave her the $20 plus $10 extra. She was a bit surprised, but she looked happy.

Will I go back? Oh, yes... Anything more than Naked HJ might be offered by this lady? I don't know, but I would´t mind paying if she did... She is quite sexy.

Person's Name : Susanne (I think)

Establishment :Chinese massage Lvl 2 518 Kent St

Date of Visit :June 25th 2012 Wednesday

Level 2, 518 Kent Street
Sydney NSW 2000
Phone: 02 9283 1918

Hours of Business: 
10am to 8pm

Prices:
30 Mins: $35+$20 HJ

Age : 28-30

Size/shape : Petite, with a lot of makeup. Pretty and sexy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese 

Services Provided : Massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Absolutely

My experience/comments : I had such a great experience with Angela a week ago, that when I found out that she was working today I didn't want to miss the chance. So off I went, but I wasn't greeted by Angela. Instead, I found a sexy and lovely creature called Susanne. She was wearing a lot of makeup and she looked sexy and fantastic.

She took me to the room and I undressed. Paid the money and relaxed. She was quite nice, all smiles. I enjoyed the massage, which was surprisingly good. She knows all the good techniques. She kneeled on my back and she applied the right pressure. I enjoyed it and I would return only for the massage.

Then she asked me if I wanted a HJ. I said yes, and rolled over. Then she applied some oil and started the tug. Really pleasant. Not as good as Angela´s, but actually pretty good. It took me a while, and I had to tell her to slow down a couple of times, but it was great. I exploded, got cleaned and left.

Now, and this is interesting, I didn't have enough money with me, but I asked the question about what extras would be available, and she didn't set any limits, if you know what I mean. I got the impression that the right amount of money can get you a lot from this lady. I will try next time and report!

Foxmulder,

If you want to see a particular lady here you just have to ring ahead and book. No problem.

I havew had a CBJ from Angela in the past but at $70 extra it wasn't really good value.

I have had FS here also but in my experience this is not at all common.

Kelly, level 2, 518 Kent Street
Age: MILF, probably 40+
Nationality: MLC
Shape: slim, although did not ask her to take her dress off. Some tummy under there.
Effect: her age meant it was very heard for me to get turned on merely by looking at her.
Works: Tuesdays and Thursdays
Would I return: Not to see her
Cost: $50/45, +$20HJ
VFM: yes
Opening hours: 10am - 7pm, I seem to recall

My first time at this place. The massage table is a little hard, but I settled in. Upon arriving, Kelly opened the door and took me to a room. I guess she got to the door because she wanted to get ahead of the younger girls, whom I saw in the waiting room on the way out (but only momentarily, not enough to assess).
She asked if I had been there before, I asked for a soft massage, and through such indirect negotiation my desires were made explicit.
Usual soft on back, really good crach work and tackle tickle. 
I touched her legs and pussy through her clothes, and I initiated turnover afer abotu 20 minutes. Kelly worked hard. As she is not my type, she maintained a vigorous handjob for most of the time, although she was clearly getting tired. I asked her to rest a few times. Howeverm when I say vigourous, I mean in a nice way. She started soft and slow, just the way I like it, and was generally responsive to my comments. Still, I had issues coming, but eventually gave her verbal signals that her touching the date was appreciated. She took this message onboard, and I blew like a geyser!
Would I go back?  I prefer them young, so will try to go back there on a day other than Tuesday or Thursday

After a series of punts at this establishment two years back i gave it away after one of the women pulled a grifter stunt. A recent visit did little to whet my appetite for a return visit. However,  on the spur of the moment, after reading  foxmulders recent  reports of his recent Wednesday romps I thought i'd chance my luck last Wednesday.

Met at the door by Linda -  very tall (172 cm),  32 years old, chinese, athletic body well covered, shoulder length hair black with a curl or two,  cute in a girl next door way. It was a damn cold sunset and i was relieved to find the room at a comfortable temperature. I took an hour.

Linda's english is excellent, she is pleasant and chatty.  I won't bother making this long winded,  the first time my cock was touched or mentioned was at approx 40 minutes in when a hand job was offered for $20. I paid for this service and it was competently performed.

Anyway, things took a turn for the better on friday elsewhere.

Dropped in a couple of weeks ago and saw mi mi (may may) ??? Sounds like the may may from the previous review....

Anyway,   Had won some cash in lotto so decided for a quick celebration.  I had seen may may before and she has a nice tight body with small tits. A great but and perfect tiny snatch.

Since I had seen her before, I mentioned that last time was great, but I was hoping for something even more memorable. She asked how much more.... I said, "everything" !  But she said no, I was too big... (yeah right) while grabbing and rubbing my cock.    Anyway, she said she would do naked plus BJ - she asked how much I wanted to pay and I said $70, but she said no, not enough and had a quick look at my open wallet and she saw my hundred....  Damn, she said she needed $100.  

I hate arguing/haggling about money as I feel you always get a better service from someone who gets paid what they think they are worth..

Anyway, I gave the hundred and had a great time, with her finishing the BJ in a 69 position with me stretching her pussy Lips apart.

More than I expected to pay, but no overly expensive for a nice young girl with tight body.

These girls are unbelievable at spotting an errant $100 or $50 bill in your wallet or kick.

I am glad you enjoyed your time Stealth, because usually the ones that want to up the price are generally poor in the performance. (especially considering you were most likely after the deluxe package and not the family deal)

Nationality or Ethnicity : Shanghai Chinese

Services Provided : R +++

Value for money/recommend? : yes, it was great and she was very friendly

My experience/comments : arrived upstairs and she gave me the 35/60 price and what would you like. There was an old Mama San in the kitchen with 2-3 other girls that were average lookers but the girl that greeted me was a stunner with a skin-tight black leather 1 piece with a zip from the top to bottom at the front  yummmmo.

She asked what I would like and I asked what was available but we never really ended up getting anywhere. Almost walked as the place is a bit grubby/untidy looking but changed my mind and decided to give 30mins a spin as can always come back again. Also had to catch the train north so was running a bit short of time.  Massage was decent maybe7/10 without being sensational and her hands started to wander about 15mins in. then started chatting a bit and was offered main course which surprised me  as nothing else was even mentioned prior to this!.......seems that she was keen for the main event but I negotiated a $20 T option which was definitely worthwhile. To be honest, I was totally shocked as she was such a lovely sweet little thing.  Just made it to the train stn. in time and slept all the way to Newcastle.

I saw Angela here a few weeks back. Mid 30s? Chinese. Nice smile, nice body, further descriptions are above. $35 for 30 minutes massage agreed.  Massage was adequate but she kept chatting away: I prefer to just chill and enjoy the massage. Time to turn over.  Hj for $20 agreed.  She started off very slowly and very gently and then slowly increased speed and to medium pressure for a deeply satisfying delivery.  Truly an expert. Great value for money.

I was offered a massage in the Office.....WTF.  I asked if I could wait and this was granted.  The girl who I did not ask her name got me to wait in the so called waitin room.   After 10 min I was shown the massage room.  The massage was good and solid.  I liked it when she got on the table and placed her leg right up into my crotch so that she could reach my back.  The massge was good with a nice amount of tackle tickle.  On the turn over I was asked if I wanted a HJ and nude.  As I like then slim I went with just the HJ.  The HJ was first rate and she did a great job of it.

Date of Visit: September the 5th 2012

Hours of Business:

Prices: 35$, 30 mins + Extras

Age: Around 20/25?

Size/shape: Fantastic!

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: Massage, RNT

Value for money/recommend?: Yes

My experience/comments: This has become my favourite shop, and the main reason is that all the girls have great attitude. They always greet you with a smile, and they are fully engaged during the massage.

Mimi is astonishing. She is pretty and has a fantastic body, which she showed to me for 50$. I usually never pay just to get the lady naked, but I made an exception with her. What a body!

We didnt even bother with the massage, she went straight into the fun part. The tug took a long time, and she worked hard for it (I am not 20 anylonger!!!). At one point, she got naked and she was so sexy that I asked her if something else was in offer. She offered CBJ for another 50$, which frankly was too much. I was not about to spend 135$ bucks in a CBJ. I asked her if she offered FS, but she doesnt. Now, I would have spent 100$ extra, or even more, for FS with her. 

Will I be back? I would, as Mimi is really lovely, has a great body and the tug was good. The only problem is that she is so sexy that I want more with her, and I dont she is going to give me what I want.

Establishment : Level 2, 518 Kent Street, Sydney CBD

Date of Visit : 22/09/2012

Rates : $40 for 30 min massage, $20 extra for HJ, extras were offered but didn't inquire price

Age : early 20s

Size/shape : B Cup, short and small (but slim)

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese (Hong Kong I believe)

Services Provided : Massage, HJ, Extras (FS I think was on offer but I did not inquire how much)

Value for money/recommend? : There are better places, but if you are in  the area, this is one of the better ones, considering there are a lot of  dud punts on George Street 

My experience/comments : Visited at about 2pm and was greeted by a  pretty young honky girl. Her voice was really quiet but once the massage  began, she became a bit more lively and talked a lotttt about her  studies, why she moved here and what she enjoyed on weekends etc...  overall very friendly experience. When turned over, was asked what  extras I wanted, I just said HJ due to only bringing $60 with me so she  happily agreed but said next time I should come try FS...a bit of a turn  off for me was that her upper right arm was bandaged up, looked like an  injury of some sort..was tempted to make a joke about her right arm  being too tired from occupational hazard..but thought itd be best not  to..Overall quite a good experience, couldnt rush back but would still  say it is a cut above the regular RNT places on george street..the girl  was at least quite pretty!

I saw Eve on Friday  several weeks back. A 30ish Chinese lady, slimmish.  $35 for 30 mins for massage.  One of the best massages I have had. Assiduously tracked down and massaged out the kinks and knots.  I asked her to focus on a pain in my shoulder, which she diligently applied herself to.  She then offered b2b for $50, and slithered over my back then flipped over. She knelt down with her pussy over my face while completing a most competent handjob. Excellent vfm.

Would return ? : NO!!!!! Cameras all over the place even in the shower :O

My experience/comments : Dropped into this place after reading the reviews on here. The place was quiet when i went in with just one girl working. She spoke English though. Paid for the massage and the massage was pretty decent. After about 25 mins she asked me if I want a special massage to which I nodded yes. She said $20 for tug n $40 for nude and tug. Agreed for $40. The body slides were erotic n I couldnt resist asking for FS which was promptly declined  . The tug was nice. Asked for DATY and she said no "too shy"... once the time was up, went in to the shower n washed off all the oil, got dressed and while walking out I noticed that they had cameras in the massage room and the shower. The girl was actually watching me take a shower on a tv, in the room next to the entrance. Not really happy with the cameras and its scary to know that I might have been recorded. I am sure something is wrong here.

Just back from this place. Saw Angela. Chinese, in her late 20s probably. Nice but seriously over-rated by previous posts. Previous posts referred to a very good body - she was slim but no arse and small tits. Also not exactly a stunner either. Friendly but not sexy. Possibly there is more than one Angela??
Massage was okay, but not good enough that I would return - much better on offer. Can't comment on the extras - they were offered but I said no thanks for the previously mentioned reasons!

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink : justmassage.com.au

 Hours of Business : 10am to 8pm

 Rates : 35 for half an hour, 60 for hour, 20 for HJ

 Age : Mid-30s?

 Size/shape : Great body, not thin, not fat, Size 10?

 Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

 Services Provided : R&T

 Value for money/recommend? : Ok

 My experience/comments : I came in during lunchtime, I had been here once before about a year and a half back.  It's the first time I have had a punt for a long time and I'm a pretty anxious dude.  The last time I came here, I had a massage with an absolute stunner.  Angela was noticeably older and I've read elsewhere that she is one of the more older ladies and they do have younger, hotter masseuses there which would be my preference.

She went through the motions of how long, I paid my $35, she left took my payment and left the room, when she came back, I had not got undressed yet and me being timid, she was trying to gauge whether I was there for a tug or not.  She asked me if she wanted her to leave the room while I got undressed, I said no need and got nude, hopefully as a hint to what I was there for.

The massage began and she asked me what kind of pressure I wanted, I asked for medium.  The massage itself was ok, not great but probably more because I could have done with more pressure but did not bother to ask so that was my fault, not hers.  15 minutes in, when she's working the leg, she starts the butt massage (not the butthole massage like I had previously here from another ML), 20 minutes in, she asks me to turn over, asks "Have I been there before?", I mention once, and she asks do I want hand and motions a hand job.  I ask how much, already knowing it's $20, she didn't put nude on the table but I didn't ask for that either, could also be my timidness at the time, which I would consider next time as she's got a banging body, not the kind of face I'm into though.  Previously I paid $50 for nude and tug FYI.

I accept the charge, I move to go get my wallet, but she stops me and says "you pay after".  Fine by me, with her handjob, she gets plenty of oil and I mean heaps, so it's super slippery and starts going for it at a comfortable place.  Though me not having punted in a while, shot off not too long afterwards.

She goes through the cleaning up motion, after we're done, we still have some time left so she asks do I want to finish there or continue massage on head or legs?  I ask for legs because I actually did have a slight issue with my thigh.  We finished up there, I paid the extra $20 and then off I went.

Attitude wise, she's very polite, seems thoughtful, didn't bother with chitchat really if that's what you're after, which was fine by me.  All in all ok but my preference is for younger girls, but I'm happy to come back another day and if she's rostered on, I wouldn't say no to a tug.

My experience/comments :

Went to city to meet my friend for a dinner, got to  the city a bit early. Walked around and pass kent street, saw an ads board outside this building just around the corner near a french restruant. 
I got a bit back pain from the gym, so decided to give a try and kill some time. headed upstairs, this shop is on the top floor of the building, was greet by a mature lady. She asked how long do i want and I chose to have an hour massage with oil.
She led me to the massae bed with blind, the set up looked a bit not clean and with food smell.
Later a young lady (mid 20) came in and introduce herself as Monica, by then my close was off but with undie on, she asked me" can i take this off? " why not, obvious a sign.
Started with an ok massage from the back, then progressed to lower back. She started slowly crawling her fingers up my derriere, i did not react much, she continued for 5 more mins with this "light" massage
As I turned over, had a closer look of her,she was slim and shorter in height , very cute face and plump lips and a nice body. she noticed that i was looking at her, so asked straight into the topics, extra? 
Was offered 20 for a HJ, and 50 for nude. 
To be honest, i was not feeling anything plus i had a big night coming. so I said next time. She was dispointed, massage lasted another 10 mins. When she finished, I looked my watch, it was only 45 mins.
Anyway, it was time to meet my friend so did not argue.
The massage was ok, and the girl is cute. Maybe come back for a different routine.
Got back home and checked this place online, I have provided the link.

 Value for money/recommend? : Oddly enough, yes, mostly because of the quality massage

 My experience/comments : Another lunch time visit and to be honest, I come here because it's a cheap place to get a rub and tug as I ease my way back into punting and use these cheap punts so I don't get as nervous when I spend a bit more.

Apple opens the door and to be frank, I'm disappointed.  She's quite plain, in body and face.  I'm disappointed because I know here, whoever opens the door is the person massaging you.  Into the room we go, she seems to fumble through the motions, telling me to undress while she leaves, before she's even asked for payment.  We back track a bit and I ask for the half hour option, I also asked straight away, how much for extras?  I motion at the handjob motion, she says just for this, extra $20.  No mention of nude handjob, which is fine because I wouldn't have opted for it anyway.

She leaves, I get undressed, lie on the table, she returns and asks, would she like me to start with massaging the back, yep that would be great.  This is where I'm surprised because she's actually quite good at this, which is a change from my previous visits here where the massage has been ordinary at best.  She actually tells me it's her first day working here.....ah, that would explain alot!  She massages my back and then my legs, doing a very good job of it.  20 minutes in, she doesn't say "turn over" but mumbled something but I turned over anyway.

Surprisingly, her HJ technique was to my liking as well.  She started it like a gentle massage across the whole cock / balls / hip, partial stomach region, gradually working into just my cock with one hand, doing some sort of a gentle twisty thing which I liked.  I came soon after, and she asks do I want to get cleaned up with the wet towel?  Yes please.  She did back, legs and wasn't sure about cleaning up the front because the wet towel had gone cold by then, but I didn't mind at all, but it seemed to worry her.

She finished with a head massage for the remainder and then she did a we're done, thank you, see you next time and she was out of the room before I got dressed, which is probably more because she's new at this stuff.  That left me fumbling my way out to remember which door got me out of the joint, but the other girl on duty pointed me right.  For reference purposes, I didn't get her name either but she wasn't much of a looker either, but once again, this is a cheap place and the girl I first saw here along time ago who was gorgeous might have been an anomaly.

Hi Mickeyd and Monster, since you two were the only ones to review this place lately, does this place still have issues with cameras and surveillance? 

I would love to give this place a go, but the thought of being captured on cameras is a little offputting.

May is a sweet thing - pretty and demure. Not the best English but a terrific masseuse. If you want a good firm massage, and a HJ at the end this is the place for you. Leave $20 out before she starts, and they know what to do at the end. It's one of the best massages I've had in a long time. She only works Wednesdays.

My experience/comments : This place has become a regular haunt as its so convenient for me on the way to pick up car on my way home. I usually see a slim Chinese lady who talk very fast and loud, cant seem to recall her name right now though. After many sessions she is quite liberal with me allowing touching fingering etc. 
This time I caught up with Jesse who was Lisa at 2b, 139 York st a few years back. She welcomed me with a wry smile and a quick up and down and  a quick nod and then ushered me into the room. In the past Jesse has been sometimes surly when the tip has not been up to her expectations and I was not totally happy to see her but laid down anyway as she isnt bad and there have been some girls here who have disappointed me in the past. The devil you know...
The massage was quite strong and relaxing with lots of brushes between the cheeks and inner thighs to keep the eroticism up.
After the turn over Jesse disrobed and showed that she had put on more than a few pounds especially round the middle. No matter I concentrated on her full tits and long nipples and her fantastic strong action on my cock.
 Unfortunately today there was no play between her legs due to the time of the month, disappointing as it made it harder for me to cum and now Jesse was having to work much harder in getting me there.
After much stroking and applications of oil I unloaded and we both were panting from the encounter.
"you very strong!!" was the comment as she cleaned me up. I said its good a work out for your arms.
Familiar face and familiar technique with the expected results. I will be back

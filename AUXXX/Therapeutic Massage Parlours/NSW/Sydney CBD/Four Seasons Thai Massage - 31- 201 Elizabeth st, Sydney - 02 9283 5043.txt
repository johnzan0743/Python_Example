My experience/comments.

Saw this when i was at the post office at lunch time on Friday. It looked legit, but you never know until you go üòè

Dropped in at about 330pm and was greeted at the front desk by the receptionist. Asked for a 1 hour oil massage and was shown into a booth with curtains offering some privacy.

Asked for a firm style massage ,which was delivered very well.Good long strokes with prefect pressure which got rid of the knots. All during the massage, there was no hint of any hanky panky and it appears to be legit.

Overall, g good place for a massage and appears to be legit.

PITT Street Sydney
Driving up the one way PITT STREET between Goulburn & Liverpool Streets all the RnT / Massage joints now have young Asian Spruikers out side, and there is not actually a full list of what they provide, even the "Hotel by the Hour" now provides girls inside and there are now so many RnT's in just this section at giving the visitors a good choice: 

382A Pitt St is the Hotel by the Hour:
382 Pitt St
380 Pitt St
378 Pitt St
376 Pitt St
374 Pitt St
360 Pitt St

I suspect the majority of the trade for the shops on this strip must come from walk-ins as of those I've been to and made enquiries of recently, reception has been pleasant enough but rostering, comms and booking is most definitely not their forte.

Was in the area this past evening. Have never experienced as brutal humidity in Sydney ever. Glasses fogged up after just a few seconds, and sweat dripping from my nose which has never happened before, followed by diarrohia a few hours later. Never again will I visit Sydney for a punt in the hot season. Lunar New Year paralysed punting activities this weekend with too many horny punters and not enough girls working and a few too many shops closed

A few Coronas might get rid of the virus.

382A Pitt was the Hotel by the hour, but recently the building was approved as a brothel by Sydney City Council and it is now operating as Town Hall Massage, They are advertisint on this forum, I do not know whether it is the same or different management (although the rumor mill suggests new). Either way, it would appear the "Hotel by the Hour" business model was not a success.

You will find on most days there are ladies outside 3 of the shops basically touting for business. Not sure if they are actual MLs, the one out the front of 382 doesn't appear to be.

Most of the one's outside 380 are.  It's basically the only shop of the big 5 here that have the working girls outside selling themselves.  And that's why they were able to lure me up a couple of times.

It will be interesting to see if all of these shops survive and re open,  none of them re open or half of them re open.  Pitt st has been a favorite part of Sydney's CBD for some.  I also wonder for the North Sydney punters, if all, half or any of the 5 or 6 shops on Hampden rd Artarmon, survive.

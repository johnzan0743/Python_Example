My experience/comments : 

After talking to Cici last week had to try out her new digs. From my work this is a bit of a hike, it is up the street from the hunter connection but before Chifley plaza. It is on the left hand side of hunter st and just after the Rockpool restaurant. It is lower ground so you will see a sign saying massage and hairdressing, you go through a set of glass doors and it is on your right. Went through the door and was met by Susan she recognised me and gave me a hug and took me by the hand to the first room on the left. The rooms are very clean and new, not particular large, but not a cupboard either. The walls go all the way up and from memory there were a couple other rooms further down the hall. I didn't ask re shower.

I only had a short time so paid over my money for 30 minutes and then a pineapple for nude. Stripped and got onto the table, which are larger than the ones at Mount St. Susan returned with a playful slap on the butt and giggle. She then started her massage and as before it is good and strong without being to painful. Typical Chinese style using elbows etc, then a bit of oil for a strong push massage, this had me relaxing nicely. This continued for another 20 before the TT started and she definitely got a rise out of me, good technique. At this stage my hands start to wonder and start to play with her pussy through her panties. She giggles and moves away to undress. She comes back and continues the TT with me now having access to her pussy etc. A few more minutes of this and it is turnover time. I now get my first real look at her and as describe she is a 30s or early 40s lady with a cups and a slightly hairy pussy. She is not fat but a taunt teenager either - not bad. She oils up little C a bit more and starts her slow tug. I suck on her responsive nipples and play with her pussy which is now getting a bit wetter. After a bit I ask if DATY is possible and she smiles and then mounts the table to allow me to suck her pussy, very nice. A few minutes of this and she is leaning a bit on the walls and moaning and seems to be enjoying herself. I continue for a few minutes and she says thank you and climbs off, I don't think she came. She starts up the tug using 2 hand action with one around the knob and the other on the shaft. She does a slow build up until I eventually blow in her cupped hand. She cleans herself up gets dressed and returns with a towel and wipes off the oil. We went over time, Susan is not a clock watcher. I dress and leave and bump into Cici on the way who also gives me a hug and a friendly pat on the arse.

There were 2 girls on - Cici wasn't one she came later I gather. I will return when in the area.

Person's Name: Lilly

Age: mid-late 30s?

Size/shape: average, nice B-cups

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided: massage, nude with roaming, happy ending

Value for money/recommend? Yes

My experience/comments: Was in the city and decided to try Cic's new digs. Not a hard choice, really, as Cici was a local fave when she was at North Sydney and I've always enjoyed very good and very attentive service from her; I figured popping in to support her new shop would be a welcome show of 'support' for her (and be rewarded accordingly); and anyway, I was having lunch at the excellent sushi restaurant directly above this place, name Sushi Tei.

In fact that's the easiest way to find this shop: just head up Hunter Street (or down, whichever direction you're coming from) towards Chifley Square, Sushi Tei is right on the corner with a large square sign on Hunter Street, and directly below this sign is the stairway down to Cici's.

A sign at the top of the stairs and visible from the street says 'Massage Relax Rejuvenate' but the downstairs area is also home to a barber's shop and I think there are other offices in this building, so it's not like you are ducking into an obviously 'happy endings here!' shop.

My decision to pop downstairs may also have been influenced by
1. generous consumption of sake with lunch
2. cute Japanese waitresses, one in particular, with that combo of slim waist, flared hips and C cups with the J-girls carry off so well

Anyway, headed downstairs, half expecting Cici to be at the front desk and pounce like she usually does, turns out she wasn't in yet – not a band thing in some ways, as I've often been interested/curious to try one of the other girls at North Sydney but every time I went, Cici was there and claimed me (but no complaints mind you, she's excellent value for money).

The lass who greeted me and steered me into the room was Lilly, easy on the eye and nice body, decent enough English too. parted with $60 for 60 minutes, handed her the change from my $100 saying with a friendly smile "This is your tip in advance, I know you'll take good care of me". I'd already mentioned that I was a regular at North Sydney and used to see Cici so Lilly knew the score.

Very good long massage. Good enough that it almost hurt at times, Lilly has clearly studied professional massage and knows what she's doing. Long enough that I began to wonder if we'd have time for playtime. But yes, we did, preceded by some stroking crackplay before I turned over.

Lilly was quick to doff her clothing as soon as I showed an interest in her body, and gave me plenty of access including some gentle fingerwork in what turned out to be a pleasingly moist downstairs. She enjoyed my attentions to her breasts and nipples too, then climbed on top of me so I could unload in her hands and across her stomach.

Worth noting: in the time I was there I heard one other gent and two women drop in for a massage. I'm sure the gent knows what he was in for, but the women would have just been the usual legit massage, so this place is living up to Cici's aim to combine professional + playtime, and thus keeping your voice down during the later stages of the 'treatment' might be advisable, more so than North Sydney for instance.

I know the feeling..! Have lately been thinking about selling up my two-bedroom apartment at North Sydney and moving into a slick modern one-bedder at the new Chatswood Place development – costs would work out approx equal even after stamp duty etc, but with Chatswood Place being a leisurely walk to most of that suburb's Asian massage places, I think it'd overall be a very expensive move! :P

Unfortunately, I have pretty much given up on city RnTs. The value in the suburbs is much greater. I can usually get FS for the $50 or more I would have to pay to see a naked woman in the city. Admittedly, they are usually older, but these days I generally more interested in value and service than just looking at a pretty naked body.   So, you probably won't get too many recommendations from me on city shops but occasionally I do weaken so keep your eyes peeled.

Person's Name : Cici

Date of Visit : July

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Address: Lower Ground 70 Hunter St Sydney, directly downstairs from Sushi Tei restaurant

Rate : $50 for 45 minutes

Age : Early 40s

Size/shape : short, nicely curved, B cups and shaved downstairs

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean

Services Provided : massage, BBBJ, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

This is a report specifically on my Cici experience at this shop. I'm on very good and very familiar terms with Cici from her time at North Sydney (that building and the one next door have been pulled down to make way for a mixed complex of Woolworths, shops, some offices and mainly residential apartments.

Wandered into the shop this time, having seen a different lady on the previous visit but thinking it'd be nice to see Cici again. Incredibly eye-catching Japanese girl greets me and I'm tempted to switch but do the honourable thing, ask for Cici (thinking that if she's not there, no drama, this J-girl will do me nicely and I'll do her nicely too).

Cici is tidying up one room, comes out and happy to see me, ushers me into what she calls 'her' room, a nice spacious one, where we hug and briefly chat and catch up before I settle down for 45 minutes (I'm usually do 60 minutes with Cici but am on the clock between appointments).

She always does a good massage and partners that with great fun at the end. There's a segue from the rub to the tug, after she cleans of the oil, where she puts a sheet of red cellophane over the lamp - back at North Sydney, it was a small coloured lamp she'd switch on after dimming or switching off the other lights. Same deal though, this is where the fun begins.

My regular routine with Cici for a 60 minute session involves her stripping off – she's got a nice comfortably curved body – and climbing on my back for a lovely languid bodyside, making very good use of her boobs and nipples the whole time, before the flip, which includes a little cock worship, light licking and BBBJ. This shorter 45 minute session she just had me flip over after some easing, then stripped down and climbed on board for a frontal slide and cockplay, after which she jumped off and we had some mutual stimulation, her on FlyBoy Jnr and me on her nicely shaved snatch, until the inevitable happened and I blew a long-overdue load all over (to which she laughed as she kept milking me and said "You wait too long, come see me sooner next time!").

So far this place appears to be living up to the standard of her North Sydney store, although without the outright Mina-at-Albany-esque raunch which North Sydney had some years back ('old timers' here will know of what I speak).

not sure if this is the same lili from the previous poster or not. but this lili is slim. a bit tall. slender.  not pretty but not ugly either. quite average looking.
but this lili doesnt go nude. doesnt allow kissing or touching. i suspect she might had worn an oversize bra cause at that time she looked quite busty, so might be just a b cupper the most. she is friendly, smile and laugh a lot. adequate english. on the massage part, quite satisfying. and the hj part also good. seems to be experienced.
overall it was 50/50 experience. i might go back there one day.

Signed up for 30 minutes and tendered $20 for HJ up front.

Excellent massage with lots of tackle tickle 9/10.      Cleaned up oil with hot towel.

Turned over, some sensual teasing then a very capable HJ 8/10.      Allowed touching outside and inside the top.    Allowed bra to be undone if I promised an extra tip.    Nice natural B cups with erect nipples.     All approaches to downstairs discouraged.    So she just got $ 10 extra as there was no pussy.    Seemed grateful.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

Been a long time since I have been here and I was in the area, so rocked up without an appointment. Bella met me at the door and showed me to the first room. She asked how long and I handed over the cash for 30 minutes and asked what were the other options? 20 / 50 options and decided on the later. I stripped and got onto the bed and she returned quickly to start the massage. Bella knows exactly what she is doing when it comes to a massage. For the next 20 minutes or so she got the kinks out of my lower back and shoulders - massage alone is worth the visit - along with her friendly chatting, nice. She then left to get the hot towel to remove the small amount of oil that she had used on me. A minute later the tackle tickle started and she soon had me lifting off of the bed so that she could use both hands on the tackle. A few more minutes of this and it was getting uncomfortable and she suggested turnover time.

Bella stripped to reveal a pretty good body for an older lady and she applied oil to my old fella. She then started an unrushed 2 handed tug - knows exactly what she is doing and will make you happy. Meanwhile my hands started to wander - tits OK to play and suck on but her pussy was out of bounds. The tug on the old fella continued and my playing and sucking of the tits continued until I blew a nice big load everywhere - Bella commented on the amount of cum. She cleaned me up with tissues and wet wipes and I left to go out into the cold again a happy man.

Bella is a nice lady who gives a good massage and tug

Person's Name : Kelly

Establishment : Chifley Square Massage

Date of Visit : November 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Address: Lower Ground 70 Hunter St Sydney PH 90902538

Hours of Business : 9.30 - 8.30 Mon - Fri 9 - 6.30 Sat - Sun

Rates :  $40/30, $55/45 and $70/60 

Age : late 30s

Size/shape : Medium build, possibly milfy figure

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : massage 

Value for money/recommend? : No, avoid

My experience/comments :

It's been a while since I have written a negative review, but should probably write this one up for the benefit of fellow punters. I did a walk in to this shop recently- it was my second visit, the last time I saw a nice lady from Shanghai who did a reasonable massage and clothed HJ.

This time it was Kelly's turn. She was wearing fairly loose fitting clothing, probably late 30s to early 40s and reasonably attractive. Things started off ok and Kelly was quite friendly. The massage was kind of lacking in power, but this wasn't too important as it was only a half hour booking I was just looking for some relief. So at turn over time was where things took a turn for the worse. Kelly asked the usual question and first up offered the nude option at $50. I declined because it did look like she may have a milfy figure underneath and besides I was just looking for something simple. So $20 was quoted for the standard option. 

The problem was when I started to touch her, this immediately got a "no you can't touch, you need to pay more". Regardless of whether the part 2 is clothed or not I only do light external touching if you know what I mean, so its not like I was trying to or intending to go the big grope. She was obviously not happy that I didn't go for the $50 option. This day I was in no mood for this kind of nonsense so I finished the massage early before the part 2 had finished.

Some fairly choice words were exchanged, her argument was that all other customers had no problem with the no touching on the $20 option. I couldn't let that slide and suggested she would lose a lot of customers with that kind of attitude and that she should have told me up front about the no touching bit. To her credit she didn't ask for the tip so I left there $40 kind of wasted but it could have been worse. I really can't understand her attitude especially in the city, where you can get a massage from a young woman at the same tip prices (my review of Yuri at DOS massage to follow- very nice!).

So my recommendation is to avoid Kelly but the shop may still be ok. It is a shame the boss wasn't there otherwise I could have given her some feedback, I did meet her briefly last time.

Value for money/recommend? : probably

My experience/comments :

I walked past this place on my way to and from work when im in the city and decided to drop in. Was shown a room towards the back od the shop and lily came in. Stayed for 1 hour and dealt with the finances. Stripped and laid down on the table. 

She xovered my lower body with a towel and srarted the massage. The massage was ok, plenty of pressure on the areas that needed work with some sly TT while she was working on my legs. Wipe off with a hot towel to remove the oil and was asked to turn over. 

She asked if i wanted a relaxing massage and i said yes. She does the usual nhj for $50 and tried to upsell nude b2b with nhj for $80. She doesnt offer anything else, so stuck with the nhj as i wasnt feeling 'it' from her. 

The hj was ok, plenty of oil and she kept blowing at it. I felt her boobs (nice and soft) and butt, but she closed her legs when i tried to venture to her kitty. I came not long after. She cleaned me up with a hot towel before hiving me a head massage.

She told me she works on wednesdays. It was an ok experience and will probably return to see someone else.

Hours of Business : 9.30 - 8.30 Mon - Fri 9 - 6.30 Sat - Sun

Rates : $70 ph

Age : 28?

Size/shape : pretty, slim build, c/d cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage, DATY, nhj

Value for money/recommend? : quite good

My experience/comments : Tried this place for first time this week.....walked in and Wendy was at the desk.....she looked fairly plain in a black top and denim skirt.....but she looked much much better when she disrobed later on. The room was clean, private and pleasant.

Massage was very firm and professional for nearly 40 minutes....followed by hot towel and some TT leading to flip.

I assisted her to disrobe and was given free access to touch and lick and suck.....but she was not so keen to reciprocate.....not happy to kiss, suck or fuck at any price. But she is very sexy and she got me over the line in a happy way.

I would see her again, but will probably try a few others beforehand.

There is a redevelopment sign on this building, so this place might close down or mover at some point.

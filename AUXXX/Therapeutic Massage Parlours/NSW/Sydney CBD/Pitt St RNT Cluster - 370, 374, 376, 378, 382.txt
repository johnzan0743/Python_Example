 Pitt St RNT Cluster - 370, 374, 376, 378, 382

I thought I'd bunch all these shops together since they are all virtually next door to each other. They are:

370 Holistic Hands
374 Apple Massage
376 Silver Fox
378 Posh
382 Chicago

I wanted to try somewhere new, so rolled the dice and chose Chicago based purely on the nicest looking sign out front.

I won't bother with the template, I got Mya, a nice looking slim Thai with just enough boobs that looked great in the stretchy dress she was wearing.

Massage was great, she knows how to give a proper firm massage, roll over was weak though. A little mechanical and not a good technique. She looked great nude, but touching was limited. There's no shower so after blowing I had to put my work shirt back on over my oily back. yuck. And it cost $90 which is $25 more than 6 Poplar just up the street which has showers.

From memory my last attempt at this cluster was at 378, and had a similarly average experience.

For half-hr you can't beat 6 Poplar thanks to the inclusive pricig. 
For 45/60 it's a lotbcloaer.

Agree that most of Pitt St is more miss than hit.
Once when going to (I think Apple) a few years ago, they were full and made a call and took me to estudio (which is a weird place)

Used to go to Silver Fox a lot when Foxy was there to look after me (Not herself, I wish !) and the lovely Lisa who had learnt all my skills !

Tried 370 once and got the boss Teresa to give me a decent massage but only a clothed HJ as there was a mixed up with my booking which I already paid her the fees and tips so I got a $30 refund in the end . 

Been to 378 once I think and got a Hong Kong girl who was pretty good but not good enough for a repeat !

Haven't been back that way since the SF Thai Breasts Vicky stopped allowing Spanish on her big big tits so what's the point ?

Plenty of choices in the city though these days !

Not sure whether Tiffany is still at 378. Haven't seen her on a roster for a while but she is definitely worth a visit. I am sorry I can rarely get to that part of the world on the day she used to work. Smart girl with excellent English and a killer body she is happy to have some fun with.

Last Saturday I was in the city early for some business and finished around 10am, so I thought, get an early bird quickie? why not. but where ?

Had a quick browse on the RnT shops roster in the other forum and found that my favourite busty girl G Cups Emma is starting at her usual 1pm, so not good and there are probably not a lot around at this early hours, the safest bet is probably head to Sussex Star and hope for the best, but the devil in me has other idea !

I have always punted at my favourite shops, seeing my few favourite girls, never really venture out and never tried another one new - for a while, and Saturday is not even my usual punting day but today I can, so why not be adventurous and do the round a bit, may be I would discover a gem. A young and pretty and very busty massage girl somewhere, or at the very least, find a more matured milf with big tits and good HJ skills ! - I just really need to get my rocks off that's all. So I walk down York Street and head towards 1A & 1B. sad story !

Then along Pitt Street, I went to 376 Silver Fox, 378 City Posh, 380 and then 374 Apple - eventually I ended up in the Hong Kong massage at Bathurst Street. I remember this thread talking about all the cluster of massage shops on Pitts Street so I post this comment here. early in the morning, it ain't good man, I went to lucky 7th shop before I found someone doable. Full review coming shortly in the Hong Kong Massage thread.

Cheers

Does anyone know if Vicky works elsewhere apart from Silver Fox? 

I've just come back from overseas and would like to be reintroduced to her great breasts again but I've noticed she seems to only work on Friday's at SF which is impossible for me to get to due to work.

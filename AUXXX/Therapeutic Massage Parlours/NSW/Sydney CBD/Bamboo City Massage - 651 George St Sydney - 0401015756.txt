My experience/comments :

I had noticed this shop advertising on another site and decided to explore it today. Unbeknown to me today was their first day of business, and I happened to be their first customer! After some confusion in finding the entrance to the building I eventually discovered the entrance to the lifts right on george and rode up the 2nd floor. Passed some offices for the 9-5ers and around the corner find a door covered in bamboo signage. An older hostess (who would nevertheless stimulate ahlungor's mamasan fetish i'm sure) greets me then another woman emerges and I recognize her as the manager from thairapeutic, also in the city. apparently the two shops are under the same management. the manager pulls me aside and explains to me that she's training new staff today and asks whether i would take both the sensual mentor and mentee for $60? I sensed my advantage, hesitated, considered negotiating her down or declining, but eventually agreed realizing that i had never experienced the luxury of a four hands massage before. I was shown to a large, very nicely made up room with clean everything. Not sure how long that will last. In come Angel and Yomi, beaming smiles at their first customer. Angel was wearing a cute sailor outfit, Yomi was looking very sexy in a low cut revealing dress. They asked me to undress and lay on the massage table and I eagerly obliged. Some small talk ensues, but I'm not there for the conversation so I let it fizzle while their four oily hands start to make my body sizzle. About 15 mins in Angel leads the way to the forbidden fruit, guiding Yomi's hands with soft whispers "Touch here, yes gently, now slide here..." soon Angel asks me if I would like something extra? Wanting to prolong the tantalizing anticipation a bit further I replied with a simple maybe. Success. the four hand tease continues to build with Yomi now more engaged! Eventually Angel asks me to please turn over, and soon a negotiation begins, $50 nude h.e. per girl or 30 (yes thirty) for just a h.e. Yomi was looking busty & hot, but I wasnt ready to shell out another 100 duckets so I went for the h.e. option, making it clear that i expected each of them to have a turn bringing me to the finish line! Angel was eager to get her hands on my nether region first and happily Yomi stayed for the action, teasing all the sensitive bits and smiling down at me with her big eyes. With all that excitement it wasn't long before Angel had a mess on her hands. Between the two of them they made quick work of the cleanup and I had only a moment to rest before Yomi dove in for her turn. Yomi had surprisingly good technique, starting soft and slow and building it up, keeping one hand to put light pressure down in the direction of the prostate. Meanwhile Angel had returned and got into the action too, even trying to kiss me. what an intense experience! Eventually the dam burst again and Yomi was clearly pleased with the result of her hard work. I made off for the shower with a surprisingly luxurious bath towel. Nice shower here! A bit more small talk after the shower as I was getting dressed, then out the door. On the lift ride down the lift was full of people in penguin suits going for lunch. awkward!!

will I return? The double was a fantastic experience but I don't think I would go for double again. Just won't be the same next time. At $30 for a h.e. it's a bit steep but the setup here is much nicer than in other massage shops around the city. If they can keep sweet little foxes like Yomi around I'm sure business will be brisk.

My experience/comments :

saw this review and thought i would check it out. place is in sort of an office complex so while very discreet from the street entry point of view all office workers gawk at you as you walk to the massage shop.

Place is brand new and decently fitted out. big clear rooms with lockable doors.

Mamasan was overly attentive as i think she is still drumming up business.

June was a superstar. English is fantastic, looks are hot and body is to die for. massage started normal enough but after about 10 was asked if i wanted extra. agreed on $50 nude and was not disappointing.  was asked to almost kneel on the table so ass and balls were exposed while June went to town from behind. this lasted about another 10 mins until the flip at which point i was almost at breaking point. did not take long to get the job done once flipped.

What was nice about June is that she used wipes to clean my hands before i touched her. she also cleaned her boobs with the same wipes after i had my way with them which is a worry when you are sucking nipples at the end of a girls shift with everyone elses saliva on there.

anyway well worth a visit to this place.

Really like this bit here, that's almost the same as Yuki's (288 Wattle St) sigature play, very erotic !!

And it's great to see that the ML is hygiene conscious, very good.

LIKE !!

My experience/comments : 

Thanks for the intel gents! 
Back in the country with a bulging sack 
Figured I'd give this place a go given the rave reviews and was not disappointed. Place is not quite the walk of shame. And if you're worried you can walk in carrying a compendium like I did. 

Into the waiting area and greeted by the aging mamasan. With a pretty little thing sitting behind her. Paid upfront for the hour (a bargain at $60) an then shown into the room by Gina. Initial impressions are good. She's in a seriously sexy number of what appears to be a flight attendant outfit with a very short skirt. The bottoms of her ass cheeks poking out. Love that look. 

Into the very very dark room and the facilities appear to be pretty good. I'm asked to nude up and lie down Gina pops out to get my change. She returns with the change and a very cheeky attitude. Asks right off the bat "massage only today or......" I say I'll take what's on offer! The massage starts and she straight away grabs MiniMaid (who is a bit excited and pointing down to my fees) exclaiming "what's this?!?! How will I deal with him?"

"I'm sure you'll think of something"

Massage is quite good. A fair amount of oil but not too much. While the massage isn't overly hard it's quite pleasant. With just some very very light MiniMaid teasing. We chat for a bit an I gather some intel, 
- from Bangkok
- likes sydney but it's a busy place (unlike Bangkok?!?)
- has been here for 3 years
- works Tuesdays
- speaks excellent English. 

Eventually it's turnover time and straight on to the HJ. Gotta say. It's Fucking amazing! She expertly works the rod and my body so well. After 5 min she takes off her top and a few min later her skirt. This girl has one sexy sexy body. I'm given access all areas and get my hands into those gravity defying C cups before working her increasingly wet pussy. This goes on and on, she takes it super slow, reading my signals and stopping me just before the gun goes off. 

Wow. Just wow. At one point she's right in my face. Riming me with one finger and squeezing the base of MiniMaid with her other hand. Sensational! This is too much and I ask her to jump up into the 69 position. She willingly obliges but warns me that I'll be popping in 60seconds. Up she jumps but keeps one leg raised, I ring her wet bell, but don't hear Greensleeves, just shuddering. I last 20seconds. Cum shoots out everywhere. A massive massive dump of the stuff. Just wow. 

She cleans up and hands me some tissues to do the same. I sheepishly wipe the cum from my own neck. It really has gone everywhere. And she jokes I was lucky not to have eaten any of it! After the tissues she restarts the massage which has another 10min to go. After 5min she jumps out to get the hot towel and starts a wipe down/massage finish. Leaving me clean and fresh before I'm told the massage is over. I get up and she grabs my cock to help me off the bed. So sweet. 

I'm instructed to come back in two weeks for more "treatment"

It's going to be a long wait....

My experience/comments :

Popped in on a Sat for the first time. Lifts work on a sat, although it is a bit offputting that the office directly opposite the lift is also open - anyhow walk around the back past some other closed shops and into the facility.

Greeted by mamasan and directed to a room.
Then greeted by Libra who is a georgeous specimen with great flowing hair.

The room itself is well fitted out with proper walls, however there is a large gap near the windows that flows through each room. Midway through the session someone came in to speak to the mamasan in the next room and you could literally hear every word.

Asked early on about extras and confirmed what i wanted then onto a very good standard massage and short body slide.

On the flip turned into a GFE style experience with most of the session spend with Libra leaning over me head tucked into my neck, good access to breasts and below while she worked me off without looking. A very different experience and an enjoyable one.

Heads up that this will be a bad review, but I will preface this with the fact that I've been here previously to see Joanna and she was LOVELY.

Ok so I call up to make sure there were girls available, and I get the standard yeah we have so and so free right now. When I get there it was just Mimi, who I had seen hanging around last week. She didn't seem friendly on both occasions, but I was already there, and looks can be deceiving I rationalised.

Nope.

We get inside the room (all very nice by the way, partitions up to the ceilings and smelt nice) and I asked for a 1hr massage. She gave me a look of disdain and countered with how about 30 mins and I take my clothes off. I needed a longer massage so I said I'd prefer the 1hr, to which she said "too long, nothing in it for me, how about 45mins". I was really cagey about the whole thing at this point, but I agreed as I was in a rush, and didn't have time to find another place.

We get down to business, and it's the worst massage I've ever had. It was more like a generalised hard rub. The worst was when she got to my legs, just repetitive hard rubbing, and it didn't even feel good. 20 mins went by (felt like ages), and I felt like getting a refund. I told her I wanted to go to get a refund, but she said it wasn't possible because she wrote it down on the books. I sighed and then flipped over for a HJ (20) . We were both pretty shitty at this point.

I leave early, the mama-san asks me if it was ok whilst Mimi was watching. I said no and walked out to have a chat with the mama-san. She seemed genuinely concerned that I had a bad time and offered a discount next time. 

It's put me off the place massively, but I can't refuse a discount ...[/COLOR]

Wow anyone that has been going to massage shops for a while knows that some girls prefer the half hour job, because they can get pretty much the same tip as they get for an hour job but have to do less work overall. Put another way all they get when its an hour job is about $10 - $15 extra for the extra half hour's work.

However its the first time I have heard of a girl actually reducing the customer's booking time for that reason. Very cheeky. If the Mamasan knew she wouldn't be happy because she would like the longer jobs because she gets half the massage fee.

Went back earlier today and saw a girl named June. She's Japanese I'm pretty sure, nice boobs, and just generally quite attractive.

Talked to the Mamasan and she agreed for a discount due to my last bad experience. $50 for one hour, and I'm pretty sure it's a once off. Note though, I'm pretty sure I got jipped with about 10 minutes, similar to last time. So make sure you say to the Mamasan "I came in at x time" to be clear about it.

That said however, the time with June was quite good. She straight up asked about extras at the start, and she does do body slides at $70. I only chose the regular extra which was more or less the standard rate.

Massage wise, she was ok. Does quite a hard massage, but not too much technique i thought. She does put a lot of effort in from what I could tell though, and you do get a sense that she does care about the massage. She does use a lot of oil I found, and I'm pretty sure that's because the body slide is her specialty.

The extra was very enjoyable, I did manage to grope a few places and found that she was just as turned on as I was....

After the whole ordeal, she offered to wipe me down with a warm towel, but suggested that I should take a shower instead due to the oil. I agreed and went through to the back with only a towel on haha. There wasn't anyone else around so that saved some embarrassment.

When I came back, I looked at the clock and saw that there was still 10 mins, not withstanding the shower time. I asked June about it, and she double checked with the Mamasan and she said that the time was up. I'm guessing that they calculate by the time you walk in, not the time they actually start. So be mindful of that.

A good experience overall, with the only negative being the time issue.

Also have to add that the Mamasan really seems to want to know how the experience was. I guess for quality control with all the girls coming and going. That factor does make you think that it's a quality establishment that listens to the needs of their customers.

Lastly, I asked the Mamasan for a cigarette at the end and she obliged, so extra points for that.

Person's Name : Libra

Establishment : Bamboo Massage

Date of Visit : Saturday afternoon in late April

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As above

Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm?

Rates : $35/30, $50/45, $60/60 + tips

Age : early 20's

Size/shape : Slim with nice body 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai or Chinese? She told me but i can't remember 

Services Provided : Massage, HR

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : So i read the review and i was out in the city so i thought i would drop in to check it out...
It was a Saturday afternoon and i made my way to George St where i got in the lift and up to level 2. Being a Saturday there were not much shops open but i can see it being a bit intimidating going in during the weekday 
Upon entering the bell rang but nobody was home. So i waited for a few mins and was greeted by who i would later be introduced to as Libra. She looked a bit flustered and said it was busy and if i didnt mind waiting. I hesitated but thought "i'm here now" so i went to the waiting room for what i was told would be "10 minutes." 
Roughly 20 mins later i heard a door opening and the sound of chatter as someone was getting ready to leave. Libra walked the gentleman to the door and returned to fetch me. She was dressed in a nice flight attendant suit and was asked how long? 
Seeing as it was my first tmie i decided on the half hour punt and handed her the money. Stipped down and lay on the table as she went to fetch my change..

She returned and as she massaged me we had a bit of idle chit chat. Moz above me mentioned she is Thai but i could have sworn she told me she was chinese. Either that or she spoke Chinese as i know a bit of chinese and she found it amusing that i was trying to say the few words i know  However i could be wrong.

The massage itself was pretty ordinary. Wasn't anything too spectacular but it wasn't overly bad. No oil was used and felt more like her just pressing into my body. It wasn't overly mechanical. Maybe she was tired from how busy it got? However on the up side, she was really friendly and although she looked a bit tired she ALWAYS maintained a smile and we pretty much talked through the whole massage 

On the leg massage she had a few brushes but it wasn't overly sensual. Once the leg massage was finished she asked me if i wanted any extra's. I settled on the $20 clothed tug (strictly a financial decision i assure you) as she oiled up. Now one thing she did that i really liked was that instead of standing on the side or straddling me she actually lay next to me on the massage table as she tugged me which was really nice. I was allowed to touch her through her clothes and was nice to hold her as she tugged me slowly rather than the mechanical tugs you get at some places. As i neared the edge i told her i was about to burst as she finished me off. She told me to relax as she cleaned me up.

All in all, she was a really friendly girl and had a beautiful smile. Massage was so-so (above average)  but she more than made it up with her friendliness and warm smile 

I really enjoyed the lying next to me during the tug as it made it a bit more "intimate." Purely my own finances is preventing me from going nude but i may miss a week and nude up with her one day

Size/shape :  both about 160 cms, slim, size b enhancements

Nationality or Ethnicity : Kim: Burmese, Candy: Taiwanese, I was told

Services Provided : nude masage plus hj

Value for money/recommend? : yes

My experience/comments : entrance is about 20m south of the Liverpool st intersection,  catch lift from foyer to level 2 then  around the corridor to bamboo. I was there near midday and the corridors were empty,  Very discreet.  Entered bamboo and the mamasan asks how long etc and then suggests two girls.  Sounds good to me so that doubles the price.  Ie 30 minute is $35 x 2 = $70. The place is clean and roomy. No sense of dinginess like so many other place. I meet kim, who is a confident and slickly presented young lady, fully familiar and engaged with the business.  Candy is more of a keen apprentice of Kim. A bit shy, and needing guidance.  Kim suggested nude. I passed over  two $50s and they took one each, clearly pleased with the transaction.  Initially I was face down and some lighting touching started.  Kim told me I was welcome to touch them. After a couple of minutes I was told to turn over.  Limited massage  then they both started to rub the rod and balls.  Kim looked at the clock and pointed out there wa plenty of time to just enjoy. Candy was doing a two handed double helix massage  while Kim moved from balls and all around the area.   I  moved my hands around, ending up with a wet finger in Candy.  The intensity of the massage was too much to hold on for too long and I let loose. Clean up with  tissues and hot towel. Then head massage, dress and go. On the way out the mamasan asked how it was.  Clearly she is keen on running a good business, and i think she  already is 
Overall it cost $170 for 30 mins.  I enjoyed it but I think I will see one lady only next time. Overall i thought bamboo  ticked all the boxes for me and it will be on my favorites list.

Had been reading about Bamboo for awhile, so thought I would give it a go when I was next in the city.  The location of the massage parlour is very convenient (and quite discrete) as you could be visiting any of the other businesses there.  Entered to find a nice set up which looked modern and clean.

Jenny was sent in and I happily accepted her and paid her $60 for the hour.  Jenny stayed in the room whilst I got undressed and hopped onto the table.  The first part of the massage was good and would pass as a legitimate massage at many places.  I was feeling very relaxed.  On the instruction to turn over I accepted the naked HJ offer for $50.  Jenny undressed and showed off a nice body.  The RNT was great.  Jenny had a good technique with lots of swirling of her hands around the head of my cock, and she knew how to tease as she would change her tempo and then hold off as she tried to make me last longer.

During the massage Jenny kissed me and used lots of tongue whilst still expertly massaging my cock.

I exploded and Jenny cleaned me up with hot towels.

It was my first visit to Bamboo, but will definitely not be my last.  Overall a great session.

Services Provided :  Nude RNT

Value for money/recommend? :  Yes, very nice girl

My experience/comments :

After reading a few positive reviews about this place I thought I'd give it a go. Went in the late afternoon and was shown a pretty slim girl who turned out to be Kim who was wearing a short dress which showed off her legs nicely. Kim's english is very good (almost fluent) and in the room there was no messing about. Before the start Kim asked whether I wanted extras and suggested nude + happy ending at the now going rate for these kind of places ($50 tip above the standard massage fee of $35 total $85). 

Kim stripped down to her panties at the beginning of the massage (chinese young girls should note this) and then took off the panties at the relaxation bit at the end. I asked for hard massage and Kim's interpretation of this was to dig her elbows and knees hard into my back - a little strange but hey a proper massage is way down the list of priorities at these establishments. At turnover time the hj technique was excellent Kim took her time and teased the head and plenty of two handed action had me over the line in no time. She has an excellent attitude and is a very confident girl. Oh I almost forgot to mention- killer body. Slim with firm boobs that are probably somewhere in between B and C cups. I think a previous reviewer may have said they are bolt ons- not so sure about that they felt real to me. External touching was allowed and as that is usually all I need I wouldn't know about anything extra above that.

So yes I can recommend seeing Kim.

Person's Name : Sumer

Date of Visit : last Friday

Rates : $35 for 30 mins plus $20 hj

Age : 40?

Size/shape : size 10

Nationality or Ethnicity : prc

Services Provided : massage , hj

Value for money/recommend? : excellent

My experience/comments :dropped in without an appointment .  Mamasan, Sumer, remembered me from my earlier visit, see review above. She explained no girls available, looked through some paperwork then offered that she would was available.  The younger ladies here are hot and skilled, but not available so I said yes to Sumer  Downside of mamasan's are they running the business so they are answering phone calls and questions from other ladies, but they are often seriously skilled.  So I got both skills and distractions. I asked for a medium massage, which was simply excellent, although she multitasked  by chatting away with the phone tucked under her ear.  Limited but sensual TT. During the time, she left the room to sort out something.   Flipped over, further massage then superb HJ, one of the best. Probably in there for 45 minutes, to compensate for the distractions .
I will return for more.

My experience/comments :

My first poor experience at this shop. Not quite sure why. Think I'll put it down to seemingly a new girl.
Have previously seen Libra (reviewed) and Kim and Summer (very similar experiences to other posts)

Anyhow dropped by without a booking, arriving at 35-past. New mamasan on duty (not Summer)
Told girl would be 10-min and asked to wait in the little 'room' next to reception.
Heard mamasan call out Angela, new customer.

A few minutes later Angela appeared dressed in a tight stripey shirt. She is slim and with well defined legs, but an average face, but good hair.
Anyhow led me into room and collected cash for 45-min.

Then went back next door and seemingly said good by to other customer. After waiting a few minutes she finally came back in at 40-past and started massage.

First 25min was all SOP - good amounts of oil and a decent had massage. Then movement down to the legs with lots of flicking inside the groin.
Decent amount of small talk establishing I had been there before and where she was from etc. Been in Aus for 9mths and English OK.

Then a request to flip and lots of massage on the legs, close to the groin but not touching. She then said 'MMm two handed' and I said yes. Then moved up to the chest and stood behind me head. At this point I reached behind me and ran my hands up her legs to her ass and said cute ass. A bit more massage on the chest and groin. Was quite obvious what was wanted I would think, although throughout I didnt get a single smile from her,
Then she went out and grabbed a hot towel - normally the precursor at this shop and wiped be down on the front and loosely on the back when I sat up.

Then moved to head massage (which was weird). Then said water or tea as she walked to the door. I said water, and she said OK see you outside.

At this point it was 7-past (ie barely 27min of massage).

Got dressed and was out at 10-past. No mamasan to be seen but cup of water on the desk. Gulped that down and then as I was about to leave. Mamasan said 'Oh you just come in' (she had greeted me only 30min before).. I said 'No Im leaving'. She then asked how massage was. Was beyond it at this point and just shrugged and said fine. As I walked out the door glimpsed Angela to the right seemingly walking back from the communal kitchen with a full jug of water.


So anyway, no tip paid, and shortchanged 15min

Rates : $60 for 60mins

Age : 25

Size/shape : size 8, b cup, nice legs, cute

Services Provided : Massage plus full nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, very nice girl. Reasonable English. Vivian told me she only works Tuesdays.

My experience/comments : Was visiting Sydney so decided to try some places in the cbd. Easy to fine place and nice discreet entrance. Arrived without a booking and picked Vivian as being the best looking of who was available. At the end the mamasan (Summer) was keen to know how things went as she said it was Vivian's first day. I told her it went really well. Vivian was cute with a sweet smile and a nice body. Her nice legs caught my eye (not that she was tall). Once in the room and after some chit chat and compliments about her looks (its always important to make sure the girl feels good about you) I didn't wait long before asking how much for a nude massage. Vivian said $50, though she seemed a little surprised at my haste. At that point she undressed and the focus quickly turned to my cock. She was quite happy with plenty of touching and gentle rubbing of her pussy and clit. She wouldn't allow fingers inside but she was more than happy to spread her pussy lips wide and give me a nice view of her pink pleasure spot. Vivian was quickly up on the table and was all over me with lots of views from varying angles of her pink pussy, legs, ass and gorgeous curves. She was a real cutie. The beauty of gazing at the naked Asian female form turns me on and Vivian provided plenty of eye candy. She may have been 'new 'but certainly was not shy. The HJ was very good too. Slow and steady. She needed a bit of direction as to how to do things but her touch was good. I'm returning tomorrow and while I have no complaints about Vivian I have booked a different girl to see what else is on offer. A review will follow...  

My experience was good but as always with massage girls YMMV.

Age : Late 20s

Size/shape : size 6, B cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai. 

Services Provided : Massage. Nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :
This place doesnt look like an RnT AT ALL!! I was wondering if the intell was wrong untill Summer the mamasan said "how are you honey?"... Once the honey bomb gets dropped, you know youre in business.
You can tell summer is trying to run a quality ship here. From the moment I walked in she asked me to please sit down and brought me some water. The place is clean, tidy and discrete. Bonus points.
Summer tells me that all the girls are busy but her new girl, first day on Sherry will be ready in 5 mins. No problem Ill wait.
Sherrys quite attractive. size 6, B cups, late 20's Id say, thai girl in a little black dress. Her english is excellent. She asks me how long Ill stay and i say 30 mins and i hand over $35. I look at her and say "you do take tips right?" she says yes, so I hand her a $50 and say "this should suffice?" she asks is that for B2B? to which i respond of course, and she agrees. With business out of the way I nude up and lie down.

Her massage is great. Much better that alot of professional massage joints. Definately woth the $35.

She then does a quick tity rub on my back and starts some tackle tickle. All good thus far.
On the turn over she does about 15 seconds of B2B, and get stuck into the HJ. You can tell shes fresh to this. I tried to touch her tits and every time i did she had an uncomfortable look on her face and would reposition her self a little to make it less easy for me. Shame, shes quite attractive. If i have to focus on cumming, then as far as im concerned, the ML hasnt done a good enough job or working me up. But ill put this down to her lack of experience.

In summary i think the place is great, and summer will run a good and successful business. Sherry gives a great massage, but maybe the business end needs work.

I will return to try other girls for sure. But ill give sherry a miss.

Btw, summer herself isnt bad at all. I mean she might be early 40s but shes in great shape. As I walked out and she asked how the session was and for me to please return soon, I found myself filled with the desire to ask if I could see her next time.... I might have a crack....

Peace out.

Rates : $45/30 + 50

Age : Mid 20s

Size/shape : size 6, C cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese (other website with roster says Chinese/Japanese)

Services Provided : Massage. Nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

Popped in without a booking on Thu (where I would normally book Kim, although have recently been going to QVB instead) and took my chances and got Kay Kay.  Ushered into the room closest to reception, which unfortunately means you can hear and smell (dinner including a vegemite sandwich) due to the large gaps at the top of the wall.

Kay Kay was wearing one of their stylised uniforms with stockings which looked pretty darn sexy.
I asked for a hard massage and got it - lots of back cracking, hard elbows and some real work with knees into the back -- really enjoyed it. Some very minimal glances during the last few minutes of the leg massage before out to get a hot towel.

Not hugely talkative, although in that room I would prefer not to talk much either.

On the flip negotiated the $50 package and she slipped everything off to reveal a great body, with beautiful natural looking tits that she was more than happy to have caressed and lightly suckled, while reciprocating.  Before we started insisted on squirting some sanitiser onto my hands (I guess a good sign). Quite bushy down below, and happy to be touched there and indeed got a bit wet.

Definitely another option for Thu, some real stand-outs in the CBD on this day.

My experience/comments : 

Ok recently tried out this rnt joint, second visit I met Sammi, young and pretty taiwanese uni student. Dont bother to write the first visit, it was not so good but managed to got over the line in the end, that's it.

back to sammi, it was late friday evening (8.30pm), tried my luck ringing the intercom in front of the building entrance, I know world square has many entrances, for those who want to know, it's the one beside cotton on facing george st, some one picked up and the door opened, what a lucky day! Because I was told the shop closes at 8pm or 8.30pm unless you have a booking, but I did not book that day. Due to the discrete location, it's a commercial building, so no one will know you are going to have a rnt upstairs lol, this place soon become my regular shop now.

Sammi is young and pretty, not busty though but no worries, a slim and pretty girl is enough to make me happy, massage started ok, asked if I like hard or soft massage, hard I replied, but I didn't feel like hard, probably medium only for me. 15min passed she went out to get me a hot towel and wiped my back, ok then I was given a few options, hj, nude hj, standard rates applied but also she asked if I like b2b hj which she's asking for $70, given that I have limited punting budget each week, I politely declined and just went for the $20 option. the fact is, I'd rather pay $80 30min to my fav wl to have a bbbj cim session lol. Anyway, her part 2 did not dissapoint me, not many ml can make me hard on before turn over but she did, and I loved it so much, sensual and teasing hj with different techniques got me over the line in 30min mark. dressed up and left in no time because I was late for dinner appointment. once again not have to be sneaky when walking out because all the workers had left on the same floor and just feel like finishing late from work when going out the building despite heaps of people waiting for bus in front of the building.

will I go back? yes but I'd like to see June, japanese which the mamasan told me I can't miss it. stay tuned..

Having taken my watch to the best watchmaker in Sydney for a service, found myself turning the corner by 650 at about three in the afternoon and thought, Why not? I guess I needn't repeat all the details and instructions above  they all worked!  and as most guys have said the place has a pleasant enough atmosphere. There were a couple of girls on duty, so I picked the one I fancied most (am stupid with names, but she may have been Vivian?) I handed over the cash and said, What would happen if I gave you another $50, and she grinned and said, 'My clothes will fall off.' I did, and they did, and a very nice view was the result, with a typical Asian body  smallish but beautifully firm breasts, and a nicely shaped little cunt, shaved, and with what looked like (and turned out to be) a little pink dot of her clit at the top. She gave an excellent massage, with all the pressure points, and gradually softened her touch, pulling my legs wide apart so she could slide her hands right up the inside of my thighs until her fingers were on each side of my balls, and pulling the cheeks of my ass apart so that the tips of her fingers bushed my anus, which I always find a delight. As she worked at the side of the table I made sure as usual that my arms were just at its edge, and son felt her body brushing against them, which I rightly took as a signal that I could caress her thighs and bottom as she worked. When she stood at my head she was just able to reach my buttocks by bending over and running her hands down my back; as she did this she made sure her breasts rubbed against my back  and of course I was happy to cup her neat little buttocks in my palms.
At the turnover I think she was slightly surprised that my cock wasn't hard  in my ninth decade I find it needs a bit of direct stimulus. She looked a bit worried and said, 'You o.k.?' I said 'Very', and grinned at her and she relaxed again, and bent over and kissed my cock. I rather hoped for a little more from her lips, but sadly not. However, she bent over as she attended to my legs and welcomed my hand sliding up between her legs and lightly massaging her cunt, which I was happy to find grew a little slippery as I fingered it. She tend began to tease my cock, and I asked her if she'd climb on top so I could enjoy looking at her little cunt, which she was happy to do. She teased me long and slow and light, and didn't object as I gradually fingered her more directly, and after a white raised my head and gently licked her. She shivered, but I think really didn't want to go further, increased the pace, and I came.
I shall certainly return. Pretty good value, nice surroundings, pleasant girl; what more do we want

[COLOR=#333333]See the ad regarding bamboo massage on other website so decide to tried it out. Call and booked for Kim. The place is not that difficult to find which can be entry via a busy street. Arrived at the reception and asked for Kim who i've booked for. Kim came out and man, she was hot. She was petite, slim and had great tits. Kim took to one of the rooms and we discuss the cost which was $60 for the massage and extra $50 for nude Hj which i agreed. The session started with a massage which i request for to be strong and she thoroughly delivered. Kim's massage skill was excellent and hit all the right places and really release the tension in my body. For the second part, she undressed and started slowly teasing my body and starting body sliding with tits slide forwards and backwards on my back and as turn over, the body 2 body continued. She grab the oil and slowly starting playing my cock while was fonduing her natural C cup tits. it didn't take long for me to cum. Kim grab a hot towel and clean me up and finished off with a nice head massage. Overall a great punt and would definitely go back to see her again.[/COLOR]

Sammi, level 2, 650 George Street
MLC, 23yo
slim, young and innocent; panties stayed on
$60/60 + $50 for HJ/almost naked; said $70 instead of $50 would have gotten B2B

My first time here. I agree that I would like to do the Mamasan   However, Sammy is a sweet slim young thing. Those are probably A-cups, essentially she is flat.
She is very friendly and talkative. Certainly a GFE here. Anyway, she massaged me nicely, with some teasing. I turned over and, for the upsell, she tried to tell me why I should pay $70 for the B2B, about how good the quality is. I do not doubt this, but wasn't going to do that for my first visit.
Now, her English is quite good, so she was quite responsive to instructions, and she adapted the HJ to my requests. Of course, while she was doing this, I got her to lean over and I managed to lick and suck those little nipples. Wow, either this girl is innocent or a great actor. As I saw the response from her, I though: yes, why not. 
I got her to lie down, and massaged and teased her. Her panties stayed on, but I managed to work the clit through them, and pushed in a little - but not much. I am pretty sure I got her to orgasm. In fact, I suspect that this was a relatively new experience for her (or else a great actor).

It was so nice to see her O that I felt guilty getting her to stand up while she was coming back down from it. So I stood next to her and services myself while ocularly lusting over her young firm body.

What a babe. I would certainly go back. I am concerned that, after a few months, that innocence and inexperience will be gone

Tasha (or Natasha?), level 2, 650 George Street
Thai, early 20s
here two years; great shapes body, firm; B-cups, I think they're bolt-ons but nice sensitive nipples; she has a belly piercing.
$60/60 + $50 for HJ

Second time here, no booking, Tasha was first cab off the rank.  I was sweaty - she offered a shower, but I declined if she wasn't offended by my sweat. She said it's OK.

She was dressed in a short leopar-dprint mini-dress, with red bra and thong. 2/2 so far. Very nice and friendly and - because she's Thai - the massage was a proper massage (not that Chinese stuff!) First half hour was her massaging me, quite relaxing, while my hand did start to wander up between her legs.
Not sure if she had hair down there. I did group, didn't feel much hair, and didn't actually look :P

Anyway, lovely friendly girl. Responded well to my touching. While I was still lying on my friend, she did a really awesome tease, touching with her fingers and fingertips all over, doing TT enough but not too often.

On turnover, she went straight to HJ, but was very receptive to requests. She was happy for me to fondle, but didn't want my fingers to go too far in. Her sensitive nipples seemed to have gotten her aroused, but the moisture down there was limited (although present). I certainly didn't make her orgasm, because I was too busy enjoying the experience.

When I came, she didn't stop, but wasn't too aggressive, so it was a pleasant blow.

I would certainly see her again. Two out of two: this place so far for me has nice friendly sexy girls.

My experience/comments : Early finish at work so decided to try another place in the city. Will not be in the city as much anymore so sample a few and then settle on a fave.
Called ahead to make sure they had girls available and did not have anyone in mind.

Was allocated Jessie who had a very bubbly and friendly personality. Place itself is ok from a discreet perspective, although it is on a floor with some other health services and accountants etc

Inside the rooms are ok didn't ask for or get a shower offered but it was a quick visit.

The massage quality was quite good with theraputic benefits I am sure.

On the flip the massage technique was not rushed and quite sensual, she used a different technique using two fingers slightly ajar and the other hand to hold while the two fingers moved up and down.

The ML herself was quite attractive with probably a/b cups. She allowed some hand movement but kept the legs as close together as possible. But as I got closer she allowed more access.

Clean-up with VERY HOT towels, head massage and on my way.

On the way out bumped into another punter on their way in, quite awkward but thats the luck of the draw.

Overall pleasant experience, good service, friendly and welcoming. Reasonable standard pricing.

Nationality or Ethnicity : 100% Japanese

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Visiting Sydney and decided to revisit this place and wasn't disappointed. Turned up without an appointment in the morning and a Japanese girl was available. June is quite attractive and a sweet delight with her cute and sexy Japanese manner. I have a weakness for Japanese; they are my favourite Asian girls. Once in the room handed over $60 plus $50 for a nude massage. June then left while I got changed and once back in the room she stripped off to reveal her sexy smooth body. I asked June to spend her time massaging my ass and cock, which she was quite happy to do. Her touch was very nice. As she worked my cock I started to gently rub her pussy and clit and also slipping my fingers inside her pussy. She offered no resistance when I started to play with her pussy/clit and became quite wet. I then asked her to hop up on the table and lie back with her legs spread while I stood beside and started to play some more with her sweet pussy. Next thing she asks me if I would like to have sex with her. She suggested another $50 and I thought why not. Luckily I had a dom in my jacket pocket (I had a feeling something might eventuate and decided to bring one just in case) and in no time I was working her pussy hard with my cock. This went for some time in various positions. As time got closer to the end I pulled off the dom and June gave me a wonderful HJ to finish me off. All up a very enjoyable session and $160 total for the hour. June said she only works Wednesdays and Fridays. Perhaps I got lucky with FS as I haven't seen it mentioned in any of the other reviews for Bamboo. Hence the standard disclaimer applies: YMMV

Was introduced to 2 girls. She was the prettier of the 2. Fairly short, proportioned butt and titties but nothing outstanding. Dark, tanned thai skin.

She makes you feel good. A teasing way of talking and making  the  most of the conversation. Good massage skills, and for some reason especially relaxing.

I asked her to be slow with me as I was quite horny and she took her time. I would put her as a good all rounder. Face, body, massage, good cock play. You can't go wrong here.. just cute.

As the above poster gave the details about Kim I will add my 2 cents.

Was recommended to see this girl by the boss. I paid 35 for 30. Got there at 730, had to wait a bit. Kim was going to go home but then I was introduced. Pretty nice  girl but a bit of an attitude.

She  said can we do short session and I agreed. When I was naked I realised that what she meant by short session meant no massage at all, and her not getting undressed. was a bit of a struggle to negotiate a price so I said fine, next time.

She seemed too much of a business girl that I wont bother trying her out. The vibe has been lost. But she is a good looker. Make sure you get her not too late in the day. Most girls finish at 8+ here.

A fellow has asked about if there has been any thai girl I have seen at this shop that might give extras over the standard extras. For me I have seen only 2 thai's out of this shop. I did not press the issue however I would think by attitude Gina would say no to extra extras however the other one which name escapes me might be a possibility.

Person's Name : June 

Establishment : Bamboo Massage

Date of Visit : October 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Suite 27, Level 2, 650 George St, 0449 922 900

Hours of Business : 10am-8pm

Rates : $35 for 30mins + $50 Nude B2B

Age : 30

Size/shape : Size 6-8, little B cups, quite pretty.

Nationality or Ethnicity : 100% Japanese

Services Provided : massage, HJ & Bodyslide

Value for money/recommend? : Fuck yeah.

So Imma let yall in on a little secret, June is awesome. Like really good. But I won't be back to see her (read on).

Ive seen her twice now. She is Japanese, slim and quite pretty. She has a tattoo or 2. She has the softest skin ive ever felt and she must wax that pussy cos it felt smooth as silk with oil on it, not a hint of stubble.

She gives a decent enough massage and then she starts some tackle tickle. She actually gets you lifting up off the table almost like as if you're in a half doggy position as she plays with your back, crack, sack, and cock. I could stay there all day as she does it.

On the flip she gives an awesome body slide and her skin is so increadibly soft that with the oil its so warm and slippery. It feels great. What happens next is what will get everyone reading this review to go see her but freaked me out a little.

She mounts me and starts a BB pussy slide. No penetration, but its soo slippery with that oil and her soft skin that im getting real nervous. The first visit I told her to be careful, she looked surprised and completed my by hand. The second visit the same thing was happening so i kept pushing her hips down so that her pussy lips would remain down where the lower half of my shaft and balls are rather than my head and she kept trying to push up, which made for an interesting tug of war. I eventually came between her and my stomach if you get what i mean.

Im not suggesting she would BB or was trying to BB me, but its just outside my risk profile. Shes fuckin amazing, and as I write this im barring up and getting the urge to go see her again.... but it aint worth risking half my shit.

I think a few punters will be upset Ive let the cat outta the bag. Go see her you wont be disappointed.

Peace out.

Person's Name : Sorry - can't remember :-(

Establishment : Amellia - Thai Massage

Date of Visit : 28/10/14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Uncertain

Hours of Business : 9am - 11pm

Rates : $59/hr

Age : 40 ish?

Size/shape : Size 12?

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : It was OK - better value to be had though

My experience/comments :

Not much to report about this one.  Sorry about the lack of name, I sometimes get too caught up in the process and forget about getting a name.  The place was fairly well presented.  Really big massage tables that take up nearly the whole room, so not much room to move when getting the gear off/on.  Rooms had lockable doors, but with walls that didn't go all the way up to the ceiling, so it's very easy to hear what's going on elsewhere in other rooms (although I must say I didn't hear anyone else getting a tug).

The massage itself was pretty good.  Proper massage for sure.  No accidental touching while face down, and I was beginning to get the feeling it was going to be fully legit.  I heard one dude in another room snoring really loudly, which was pretty funny.  Never have understood how guys go for massages then go to sleep.  I suppose sometimes it's hard to control if it's a really relaxing massage, but I just prefer to be conscious so I can feel all the good feelings.  Back to the massage, she was hitting areas that I would normally expect to get done while face up, so I was thinking I might not even get the opportunity to "turn over please".

Anyway, the request to turn over did come, and with that she started rubbing up my thighs with very intentional rubbing of the cock and balls.  She then leaned in close and whispered "shhh, you want 'that' massaged too" while placing her hand on my cock.  I said yes please.  She said how much you want to pay.  I held up two fingers, and she scoffed and said no, forty.  I don't know why I accepted that, but I did, and with the negotiations out of the way she proceeded to oil up the old fella, and start stroking merrily.  Not much in the way of technique, but not terrible by any means.  Despite being super horny (I'd just been and got myself all worked up watching the lovely black stripper at the Club-X $2 peeps) she had to work pretty hard to get me over the line.  She started telling me to cum, which I don't really like.  I always feel like saying "hey, you're the one doing the wanking, how about you make me cum".  So after about 5 minutes I eventually let loose.  She started to pull her hand away, but I got her to keep stroking to finish me off completely.

Finished up with a nice sponge bath, quick head massage, then on my way.

Pretty sure 681 is correct fartichoke. I was staying next door at 683. If anything it may be the phone number that's wrong, but I did spend a fair bit of time on Google street view this morning finding the one angle that I could make out the number (most angles have it at least partially blurred). I'm pretty sure that's the number they have advertised on the street signage. I did get a business card but ditched it for feer I'd leave in my pocket when I get home, hence the need to rely on street view for the shop details.

Hope that helps?

Value for money/recommend? : Very average…

My experience/comments :

I'm not sure about this place. I've been here three times and have very similar experiences each time. By this I mean, every girl has done the exact same style massage on the legs. Tar-Tar just happen to be the worst. Every girl will touch your balls very slightly with no sensualness about it, as it happens repetitively. Tar-Tar asked me where do I want to concentrate ,I said my legs and ass, she laughed and then proceeded to touch my balls and asked "you want here". I said later, she then giggled.

As her massage was boring as hell I asked her to massage my balls, she replied with a strong No, i don't do sorry. Even though, she was continually rubbing her fingers up against them for the entire massage. WTF? I had a very similar experience with the first girl I saw here (forgot her name). I just don't get how this place runs…

I'm curious on other punters experiences. It's always busy when I've been.

My experience / comments: Thought I'd give Bamboo a try. Nice discrete entrance off George St - could be going to any number of other businesses as you exit the lift. Girl on reception was Jenny and she was seemingly the only ML available. I was happy, as she had a cute 'girl next door' vibe, beautiful smile and good English. Shown to a small room with massage table and curtain through to what appeared to be a store room. No shower offered. Agreed terms and I stripped off and lay down on the table; Jenny remained clothed at this stage. Excellent firm massage and good conversation, with the much anticipated and well executed TT towards the end. For part two, she stripped off to reveal a pert body and nice firm B cups. Good HJ technique, leading to the expected outcome! Allowed touching throughout.  Clean-up, followed by excellent head and neck massage. Overall good VFM and I will return.

Hours of Business : 10:30 AM to 11:00 PM

Rates : $40/30min and $60/1hr plus tip

Age : 25

Size/shape : Solid 8, B cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : RnT in underwear

Value for money/recommend? : Possibly

My experience/comments : Mods correct address is 651 George St.  Suggest change original title.

Thought I would try this place so dropped in without appointment at 8pm.  Place was very quiet and Mamasan appeared to be having a little sleep in one of the chairs in reception.  I get to the reception counter and Mamasan wakes up and sleepily comes to the counter and asks if I would like a 1 hour massage , yes, this girl must be a mind reader folks.  She takes my $60 and heads off down a corridor between the massage rooms, looks like at least 6 rooms, all with solid doors and the walls stopping about 40cm from the ceiling.  Mamasan initially directs me to one of the middle rooms, changes her mind and we go to one of the very end rooms, interesting.  Tells me to take all clothes off and get onto table.  Rooms are quite small and the tables are of very generous size so not much spare room.  A little while later there is a knock on the door and different girl appears - Lilly, quite attractive dressed in typical Thai ML outfit.  Lilly offers soft/medium/hard and I opt for medium.  Lilly now commences a very good medium/hard therapeutic massage, very nice and worth the $60 on its own.  Quite early on there is some gentle TT and quiet giggling so I just have to ask the question re extras, usual 20/50 hj/nude hj available.  However, to get to this point Lilly played hard to get with lots of embarrassed giggling and uncertainty re price (no doubt hoping I would offer more).  I had to agree to "no touching".  No worries, lets see where this is going.  Back onto the table on my front and massage continues with plenty of butterfly massage and reach through TT.  Despite the initial impression Lilly was new at this game, her hands were telling a different story and I found her highly skilled in the sensual part of the massage.

On the flip I was able to gaze on Lilly who by this stage had removed outer clothing but left underwear on .................. mmmmmm.  Made no comment but noted.  Part 2 of the massage was also very good.  I found Lilly is well versed in the art of the HJ with plenty of variation in technique, speed and pressure.  After the explosion, Lilly did an initial clean up then got dressed and went to get hot wet towels.  During the clean up Lilly whispered it was wrong time of month and next time she would give me body slide.  Lilly works Thu/Fr/Sat BTW.  I noted the oil was quite difficult to remove with hot wet towels and no shower was offered

Once clean up finished, Lilly left me alone to get dressed and make my own way back to reception where she said goodby.

In summary, standard pricing, excellent massage and worth a second visit.

My experience / comments: 

This place has been on my to do list for sometime and since I was in the area and the weather was crap I decided to stick my head in the door and see what it was like. The place is very clean and tidy - the cute girl behind the desk greets me - didn't get her name - and I thought it would be my lucky day. Nice little lass - she would be fun to play with . She leads me down the hall to a room on the left and I notice that the walls don't go all the way to the roof. Have to be quiet here. She asks how long and I say 30 minutes and pay over my money. I then ask if she will be the one looking after me and she says no and I say that is a shame with a frown. She laughs and says get your clothes off and lie on the bed and a girl will come make you happy with a cheeky grin. DAMN DAMN - this girl would be great. So strip and onto the bed. Wondering if I have been had and an old walrus will come in - crossing my fingers and other bits

Not long after Jenny walks in she leans over and asks straight up if I would like a nude and HJ for $50, I agree. As previously described she is a nice looking Taiwanese girl - nice figure and after she strips nice B/Cs and a bit of landing strip downstairs all good - . She starts off with a good dry massage and works my problem shoulders - knows what she is doing. While she is doing this we get chatting, her English is not to bad and I find out that she also works at Central massage - she says that I should see her down there as well with a giggle. She adds a bit of oil and she works her way down my back and when she gets to my butt and legs there is a fair amount of TT - very nice. But this is just a tease and she continues down my legs to my feet and back up again. She goes to my butt crack again and more TT and she then heads to my lower back to finish off the massage. At this time it has become a bit uncomfortable as I have a raging hard on from this teasing. She then begins the TT in earnest and I am off the bed on all fours and she is using both of her hands - great. She suggests that I turnover and I do. She then starts a breast rub - not bodyslide - over my body and this eventually leads to her putting her tits in my mouth - yum. She moves down to my cock and starts to play and i ask if I can return the favour. She climbs onto the table in 69 position and says not inside - cool. She has a lovely pussy. We both start to play and her HJ technique is good with lots of pace changing to stop me from cumming to quickly. Her pace eventually quickens and so does mine - unfortunately I beat her across the line. After I have finished she climbs down and cleans me up and I leave very happy.

Will go back to see her - she works Mondays and Tuesdays here and mix days at central

Ball licking & sucking 

Saw Christie last week, I believe she only works Wednesday.

To be honest, everything about the massage was bog average until I was offered and paid $50 for nudes/hj.

Wow/ what I got for my money was rimming lots of ball licking/sucking and the occasional tongue on old roger.

Was not expecting it which made it all the more pleasurable. Will definitely be back and maybe see what else is on offer

As Lungor reported in February, this place has changed hands, new name, same phone number and interior.  Mods, on this basis, does this shop now need a new thread??

Walked in without a booking.  A rather young papasan showed me through to the end cubicle on the left, "girl be along soon".  After a couple of minutes Cate walks in, cute little Thai thing with good English skills.  After saying hello and introductions, I offer her a 50 and holding my finger to my lips, hand sign for clothes off.  Cate hesitates for a bit then agrees with a very engaging shy smile .  I then disrobed while Cate was in the room and climbed onto the table.  Cate covers me in a towel and starts a kneading massage through the towel and an entree.  After 5 min of this, towel is folded back to bum and Cate commences a very nice/smooth oil massage on my back and neck.  Towel is then adjusted to cover one leg and bum cheek for an extended leg and bum massage with plenty of TT.  Towel then reversed for other leg/bum cheek.  Cate departed room to acquire hot soapy water in bowl with wet towel accessory. Lovely gentle and slow hot towel wipe down.  Cate then holds up the dry towel as modesty screen and asks me to turn over.  

For the front half, Cate initially does my feet then arms/hands/chestwhile the towel covers my bottom half.  The arms/hands/chest is rather engaging as she sits on the table about level with my stomach and holds my hand against her stomach while massaging arm and chest.  For my second arm she placed my hand up against her breast which appeared to be buttressed with a rock hard bra.  Note at this stage Cate has not removed her clothes so I remind her of this. Cate now stands up and gives me a rather shy striptease.  The removal of the buttress bra reveals very cute breasts A-B cup I guess with nice puffy nipples.  I suspect the bra takes Cate up one level for dress/blouse sizing.  She seemed rather embarrassed about her bust dimensions (silly girl) so I provided lots of positive comments.  Panties stayed on BTW - made no comment as wasn't going to push it this visit.

Once Cate had nuded (almost) up, she removed the towel with a flourish, produced the oil bottle and started a slow tug with plenty of teasing, swapping between 1 and 2 hands and eye contact - very nice. Cate's tug technique was nice and slow to start with and she took her time to slowly build up to a very nice finish.  Usual clean up with hot wet towel.

Cate took the hot water bowl out while I got dressed then came back with a business card with her name and working days on it (I asked for this) and escorted me to the exit.

Couple of minus points:

Cate had a bit of a cold so I didn't encourage close contact.Panties left onFront massage, excluding the tug, was quite limitedNo choice of girl unless you know who is on and book

Summary: WIR?  Yes, should be a good average shop.  Good premises - standard pricing - open later than a lot of shops and for me, Cate has potential as a regular ML - I will visit again to see what she is like without a cold.  

BTW, Cate works Tue/Wed/Fri

Firstly, Bamboo Massage is a legitimate business that does not provide any sexual services.

I however had a dream which in my fantasy provided the below service.

Person's Name : Kara

Establishment : Bamboo Massage (World Square)

Date of Visit : 16 May 2016 lunch time

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Suit 27 Level 2, 650 George St Sydney.

Tel: 0449 517 388

Hours of Business : 10am - 9pm 7 days

Rates:
FULL BODY OIL MASSAGE:
30mins ———— $40
45mins ———— $50
60mins ———— $60 
plus extras ($50 when I went)

Age : mid 20's

Size/shape : Size 4-6, slim, pointy A-B cup, full bush, teeth braces. No bum.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage, nude happy ending including outside touching, light kissing.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes.

I rocked up with no appointment and despite being very busy, they attended to me very quickly. Location easy to find, privacy wise the surrounding businesses can clearly see you entering the business however this does not really concern me as I would not cross paths again with any of them (predominately Chinese businesses).

Kara provided a Very good hard deep Thai massage. Proper technique getting into all the tight spots. I get sports massages often and Kara was up there with strength and technique.

Moving to the fantasy part. Kara stripped off and jumped on top just north of my cock. Whilst reaching around and pulling me off, she rub her pussy up and down simulating like i was fucking her. Very good.

Kara was very sexual, providing almost the gfe, even though it was just a h/e.

I personally like a little more meat on a girl, but she made up for it 10 fold.

Price wise $90 for 30mins is a little steep but if all girls provide that type of service it justifies the extra cost. I asked for FS, however it was not on the menu.

My experience/comments : 

Was in the city and looked out the window of the meeting room and saw this place, quick cracker search and it came up! Guess where I went after my meeting.

Called, told girls available, walked across the road 5 minutes later, easy to find, distinctive green bamboo motif around doorway, up long stairs and greeted at reception desk by Rose and ushered to far room. 

The place is neat, dimly lit and strong smelling of incense, which did end up in my clothes ( if that is a concern to you!).

Arranged finances and waited for Rose to come back. The room next door must have paper thins walls, as I heard everything that was said and each oily stroke, so don't think you are alone!

Rose came back and gave about a 20 minute dry massage on my legs and lower back, nice wide tables so she could hop up and press in well. Rose then asked if oil was ok, and she worked my legs and butt with lots on giggles. Thankfully the neighbour had left so I was ok to chat and give non verbal feedback of how well she was doing.

Working her way up my shoulders, and we get that whisper in the ear, hand job? Yes please. Bit longer rub, arms and hands, then rolled over, nice hamstring stretch with Rose on the table and my foot in her crotch, old fella just dangling there! that's a new one for me.

By now unfortunately, the next room is occupied again, and I am trying not to laugh at the to and fro conversation of the punter and the ML. "have you been here before", "oh just a massage?", "are you sure?", "oh ok".

Not put off by the overheard conversation, Rose then strips off at the end of the table and I see I nice waxed muff, perky natural B cups and hand full of tissues. She hops on the table and grinds into my thigh, I ask for DATY, and get a polite no, but it was the that I noticed her braces for the first time, Lucky there was no BJ on offer! Still she felt great very smooth and quickly wet.

Anyway, some mutual touching and explosive release, (she needed more tissues!) A tidy up and that's all she wrote! No lingering after glow massage or scalp massage. Kind of an abrupt end.

Nice to try a city RnT, I'd go back but first I'd visit the lots of others on offer in that area. Maybe the Twin shop up George street on the other side.

Hey Beachedwhale,
No I didn't get a line up but I didn't ask either, I just took the first one who greeted me at the top of the stairs.

Person's Name : Ada

Establishment : 651 Bamboo Massage

Date of Visit : Sept, 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Bamboo Health - Shop 2 651 George St Sydney CBD - 02 9280 4455/0449 517 388

Hours of Business : 10:30am-11pm

Rates : $40/30mins

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : Petite, slim, tanned skin, nice ass

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage + Nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)
I've seen Ada before, but at Baby Massage in Darlinghurst, I came to Bamboo Massage because I was just in the area at the time and happened to get Ada. I had a good time last time, so I said why not?
She asked me whether I wanted a hard, medium or soft massage. I said hard. 

Her massage was pretty good, very thai style, lots of kneeing and elbowing. Really enjoyed it. She worked the shoulder really hard with oil, a bit harder then last time but I guess I asked for a hard massage. It felt great afterwards. So it was about 20 minutes of that. Then on the flip she took off her clothes for the nude HJ, a standard $50 tip.

She's got a slim petite body, not much on her chest probably a A/B cup. She's got a nice booty though, fully shaved. She straddles my cowgirl style and allows me to play with her pussy and ass. As she starts the HJ. The HJ didn't start as well as I liked, as she started jerking pretty furiously at the beginning, hard to tell her to take it easy for a minute. Then it was better, and she started moaning a bit. I blew then she went to grab some hot towels to wipe me down. The entrance to this place is right on George like diagonally across from capital square, so lots of traffic. Keep that in mind if you're aiming to be discreet. Overall session was a B.

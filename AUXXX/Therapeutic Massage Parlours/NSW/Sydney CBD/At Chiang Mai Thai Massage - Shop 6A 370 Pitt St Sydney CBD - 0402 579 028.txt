My experience/comments : I noticed this place opening up opposite Holistic Hands some time ago.  Finally got around to TOFTT.  Bad idea as it turned out.  

Walked in without a booking and grumpy young receptionist agreed there was a spare 1 hour time slot, took my money and took me behind reception into the smallest 2 table massage shop ever.  There is just enough room for 2 tables with curtains between them.  Grumpy young receptionist pointed to table and said clothes off, leave undies on and lie on table   Not a good start.  Mean while ML is finishing previous customer on the other table which was all of perhaps a metre away with ML's bum pushing the dividing curtain every which way and I can hear every word between her and customer.  Finally ML comes in to look after me.  She is not in a good mood and not interested in conversation and certainly not interested in sharing her name when I asked   Well folks this was an experience to be avoided.  In summary; grumpy, rough, uninterested and cursory in a nutshell.  I won't be back.  I can't imagine how thay remain in business.

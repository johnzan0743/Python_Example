I was in the city on the weekend and saw 3 lovely looking ladies going up the stairs to this place. They were dressed in track suites and screamed as ML's as there is nothing else around this place as its an office block.

Anyway i decided to give it a go today and was quite unsuccessful but there were sign that there may be some hope.

To start with the door was locked (usually a sign)

Undies off no worries and no complaints (can be a sign)

Massive rooms with big tables with a mirror across one side and tissue box in the corner (usually a sign)

That's were it all ended though.

massage was decent enough but i was wondering the entire time what about extras.

Anyway maybe if anyone else has any feedback on this place we can confirm if its a massage only joint or not.

same experience for me. however only one young woman working due to lack of weekend customers. When i walked in it has a slight "clinic" feel about the reception, but with the individual rooms, wall mirrors and no issues with underwear off i had my hopes up.

nope.

she is a lovely girl (forgot her name) who is new to massage, and she massaged just like a newbie. not hint of extras whatsoever.  In saying that it's a very nice setup and i wouldn't hesitate to go back if i was in the area for a legit massage.

The tip is for the hanky panky pay up front. If you do assume it is on. Fair dinkum places will rarely charge upfront. This is due to the law. If someone dies on the table (yes it has happened) then they cannot be expected to pay for the unfinished portion of the treatment. If they charge upfront you may asume that extras are always a possibility.
Some places are just a bit coy about this and you should ask upfront before undressing. Never be afraid to walk. It is the pussies who stay who allow places to get away with offering the tease but no appease... If all walk after receiving the question returned in the negative then the business will go belly up or have to change their ways. After all that is why we punt. To win of course is better than losing...and it means your money is unable to be spent on fun...let alone the hour or time spent having a non tackle tickle non touching non sensual experience we all dread....

Further if the place is a Thai massage place mostly they are legit. The hint is if they are wearing a towel and offer body 2 body they are a rnt (go figure!!) but most Thai establishment are legit or start out that way.....

No I don't think I have stayed for a massage but I have stuck my head in the door. Most of the Sabai Thai places are legit. The only thai (to my knowledge) that does r&t in that area is Poplar street near the Surry Hills Police Centre. That one is connected to the one at Leichardt on Parra rd. The Poplar st was a Chinese r&t years ago then has changed hands many times since mostly having legit massage until a few years ago. The place never worked out until the nordy thai lady took over and has been going great I believe ever since.

I hope that is enough info for you. Thai girls are very gentle for the mostpart as well as being very clean which is why most punters like them unlike the rawcus old Chinese girls who remind you to have a shower asap after attendance along with being the massage that makes you want to bring your own towels...

Fact is that to be legit they must have certificates posted on the wall or available to view and the massage must be qualified otherwise if they use an untrained therapist and offer a registered style of massage such as remedial then they are breaking the law. Anyplace that is using a newbie is not legit andf it is up to you to get what you want by asking. the mere fact that you pay upfront means that anything may be on. It depends upon how you approach things.

Thank you Curly 69. I work next door to this place and have wondered about it each day. There are some beautiful Thai girls who work in the cafe in my building who drive me crazy so this place could certainly offer some therapy. I will try this week and write a review. Again, thanks for the intel.

Person's Name : Don't remember

Establishment : Photara

Date of Visit : Late Feb 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business : 

Rates : $50/45 (don't remember the rest)

Age : 

Size/shape : Fit (can't really tell you what size - I only have 3 sizes: too skinny, fit, curvy)

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : OK

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

On the night of the visit, I found I had an hour to kill before my train. I like to think that I have read through the forums enough to remember most of the names of the RnT around the city. 
Anyway, earlier in the day I had actually had lunch at Machiavelli so when I saw this place I noted it down as a place to try. 

Suffice to say I thought I was TOFTT when I visited (little did I realise someone had already reviewed this place).

Got in and was greeted by 3 women. My first impression was that it was very clean and quiet, and I thought it was a legit massage place. My first instinct was to leave, however, my adventurous spirit got the best of me. 

Was ushered into the room and told to take off my clothes. The masseuse left but dimmed the lights as she was leaving. Because I was in a full suit get up that day it took me a bit longer to get undressed. The masseuse came in just as a I was dropping my pants and there was a slight moment of indecision on her part. I just smiled and apologised for taking so long to get undressed.  

Getting on the table she covered me up and began the massage. On the flip, she continued to keep me covered. I don't know about you other gents, but when they start massaging my inner thigh and getting very close to the jewels, an accidental (or maybe intentional) dragging of nails gently across the sac will send a shiver down my spine. Well this happened a couple of times, and my D was slowly rising to half mast. Clearly visible under the slowly tenting towel....however, no offer was made. 

At this point i resigned myself to the fact that I had probably entered a legit place with no potential for a HE.

Would i return - probably wouldnt have until Curly69 mentioned that HJs were on the table and maybe even more. Will I go out of my way to drop in? Probably not, but if I ever find myself waiting at Wynyard then I might give it another shot.

Hi All, since I work nearby this joint, I thought I will check out the place during my short Lunch break(actually, had  a busy day today so trying the old 'TOFTT' was not doable..).
So I walked in and was greeted by a totally robbed up Thai look-a-like Girl,(most probably in her early thirties) and she immediately tried the selling approach if I wanted a massage. Poor thing, I had to disappoint her as I  only wanted to ask for the price list. Looking inside the joint, it looked pretty clean with a professional presentation manner aspect to it, is just the environment was looking more like a legit place.  
There is Health Funds Rebate available, which again tells me the place is legit, but I guess the only way to find it out it to give a try, more than once 
It will be so awesome  to have a proper looking Thai Massage establishment near my work where they do offer extras..just  hope this place fits that description. 
Prices as follows: 
Oil massage 
30Minites/$45
60Minutes/$80
90 Minutes/$100

Remedial massage
30Minutes/$50
60Minutes/$90

Also, If you pick up a brochure/price list (it is in A5 size) from the front door, and show the brochure to the ML at the front desk, you will receive 10% discount per session.

Not a bad deal if you near the vicinity..

Massageboy decided to TOFTT and I am very sorry I did. The girl I was allocated was very unattractive, did a shit massage and offered no HJ. I didn't ask as I wasn't interested by the the end but it was obvious I was aroused at one stage. I suggest that the HJs given here must be rogue girls and not shop policy but I could be wrong. To top it off, if you want a receipt it costs $10 extra and there is no discount so you pay $20 to get your rebate! After arguing with the boss, she refunded $10 but by that time I was seriously pissed off. Then they forgot to give me my receipt so I have to go back to get my rebate. I rang the boss to complain thinking she might offer me a discount to try again but she wasn't interested in my concerns. Apart from getting my receipt I will not go back to this shop. Very poor value for money and bad service.

MassageBoy, thank you on behalf of rub'n'tug fans and your AXR brethren for that TOFTT effort!

Many of these places can be very much 'hit and miss', especially the ones which look so very legit, but it seems to be sometimes up to the girls as to what extras they offer (if indeed they offer them at all).

But this time your experience seems truly woeful on every possible count!

The experience sucked, BUT your reward is a truckload of AXR karma for being willing to TOFTT, and I am sure this karma will soon rebound into a wonderful rub'n'tug experience at some other place.

Hi Ozboy

I can confirm that I am talking about Photata it is just near office works so pretty convenient from Wynyard station.

Maybe it is my smilling face but went there again for research purposes of course, and had Nardi - new girl, first day at the shop.
I was her first massage, asked straight up re HJ and nude - she said OK to both then left the room with the cash for the massage. She then came back and said no to nude
she had talked to the management, bugger. An average massage commenced and then after about 20 minutes the tackle tickle and turnover time.  A nice HJ followed
She allowed touching outside only

Nardi is a small petite Thai women in mid to late 20s I think if I can get her again she will nude up.

All the girls I have had here are young - the older lady runs the desk and probably only does massage - I have been here 3 times and been lucky everytime.

Value for money/recommend? : OK

Well thanks very much to Curly69 for confirming my suspicions at this place. I now feel totally stupid for all the massages i have had hear thinking it was a legit place.

The place is impeccably clean, the beds are huge and there are private individual rooms. The massage i received was not the highest quality i have had at this place but way better than your average RT joint. on the flip the top of my leg was paid extra attention and when the towel started to float penny dimmed the lights. at this point i asked for extras and was offered HJ. i inquired about others but was told this was all that was provided. dead done and still had time so penny continued the massage as i lay there is bliss.

Would definitely return for the cleanliness and quality of massage compared with most Chinese places in the vicinity. at $100 though it is quite pricey.

I was bit late to post this review, but my same thoughts as Ozboy, just needing to pay a full on visit here to quash my state of mind if this joint is really legit, I guess I made the right move.  

Was having a totally crap day at work last Friday, since this place is just near where I work, my only thought was to have a massage in tranquillity in a private room (which I had checked out recently  in quick bo peek tour during my lunch break). It was 4:00pm so I decided to make an executive decision and to book a 1 hour massage early evening.  

So I walked in and there was two ML girls sitting behind the front reception. I mentioned I had a booking at 6:00pm, then the chosen one (Jan) just smiled and asked what type of massage I would like, I opted for the Oil Massage. I paid the money to her, she smiled and she said 'follow me please'. We went into a private room, as mentioned in previous posts, clean room, nice decor and a reasonable size massage bed. She told me to undress and lay face down and said 'I will be back soon', while she was leaving the room she turned back and gave me a nice cute smile.

She came back in and started with the introductions (..My name is Jan, how are you, what is your name..nice to meet you, yada, yada, )  At this point the main towel was not on me, she   started with my feet. after, (still no towel on me), she applied oil on my legs, my hips, bum and lower back. She asked how hard would you like the massage, I said medium and she pointed out straight away I was a office worker (nice guess..) and I need more 'concentration' in the same vicinity. She started to massage me on my legs, they were softly measured up and down strokes from legs to hips. After focusing in that area, then the trickling of the ball sac started, with light finger flicking on the side of my semi erected old fella.. (yep, this was looking ominous..)

Then I started a conversation if today was a busy day, where are you from Thailand, she asked where do I live, then I asked where she lives.. (just the usual introductionary ML talk), then the ball trickling were more in high repititous and she actually brushed her fingers along my penis back a forth a few times. At the stage when I was heating up but she moved up to focus on my upper back..damn I thought, could she be another frigit tease ! We started talking about other jargon which I'm not bothering going into now. Then it was time to turn over and she placed the towel around my waist, by then, I was totally erect with the towel looking like a dodgy made tent covering. I asked if she can remove the towel, she obliged and she started on my legs. More ball tricking and penis flicking, at this stage she didn't ask me for any extras so I finally got her attention and pointed towards my shaft, she said..';Sorry, what you want..? I asked her let me whisper it in her ear, I slowly said 'Hand Job'..she smiled back to me and she started to softly caress it up and down for a few strokes, She told me I had a 'cute penis'.. (yeah right, thanks for the compliment..). What followed was a continuation of soft, teasing, sensual and caring stroking of my shaft with her other hand massaging my ball sac and with her fingers circluing around my anul opening (but no finger insertion). Squeezed here arse but had a couple of touches of her breast but in trying again she blocked my hand.

She asked me if you want it a 'bit harder', I said a little and from that point on I sense it was 'climax time'. Wow,  I could just feel my stress levels dimensioning and ready for the full on release.. I exloded over her wrist, got a bit of on her selves and pants much to her delight ! I told her, sorry, just couldn't control myself..'. She took it well and had a bit of a giigle, she told me 'it's okay, will leave my massage clothes here tonight to wash..' What a delightful experience and a cool girl, mind you she sounds to be a cynical girl but that's probably part of her 'teasing' methodology..

She cleaned me up with the tisssues first and then the hot towels cleansing on front on back. Now the strange thing is, even at the point of when I raised the possibility of a HJ, she didn't mentioned the price of the HJ, when I got up I asked her how much is the tip (yeah, bit suicidal asking her for  price, but I was feeling on the top of the work at this stage..). she didn't reply back to me immediately, just smiled and mentioned 'it's up to you if you want..I mentioned to her that I will give you a tip of the great massage you gave me (now at this stage she probably thought it was BS as well) but she was cool with that, she walked me out and reminded me to come again !

Overall, massage was like a 6/10 but I would rate the HJ 9/10, a high rating but it was damn good!. Now I didn't ask if there was any other extras on the table, was having too much of a good time.

Jan only works on Fridays, she works at another shop but she wouldn't disclose the location, fair enough. I agree with Ozboy, you could say all up $100 was pricey, but would definitely come back again, maybe try another girl next time.   

MB - Bro, give this place another crack, maybe it's best to swng pass after 6:00pm, probably better chance in getting more..

Hi Oz
Glad you finally struck gold
I went there again this week and got Leah or Leaha a nice looking petite Thai with a/ b cups
- like many others. Paid the 80 for the hour and again asked straight up re the HJ, no probs
you horny man - her words not mine- she was right I was feeling horny, but also needed a 
good massage. Nuded up and got on the table, she the gave a very good massage for the hour 
And said done, and now for the fun. Started a nice TT and then turned me over, massage around
the legs with light brushes to the balls etc - nice. She then started to play with the old fella - not bad.
Blew everywhere cleaned up with tissues and towels. Ask if OK as I was her first HJ - could have fooled me
she knew what she was doing.
Leah is a nice girl, not bad looking. But won't allow touching 
So 1 hour plus extra time for HJ all good
Agree it is a touch pricey as it doesn't include nude, but the massages in general are better
than many of the other shops

Been here yet again - nice and handy for a handy  - and reasonable massage

Anyway saw Amy smaller and stockier Thai girl b/c cups, went for 45 minutes and paid the cash. 
As she was leaving with the cash asked about a HJ - said sure no worries. Then made a motion like BJ and
I asked if she did and she blushed and said did I want a glass of water - misunderstanding. Said Yes and what a BJ as well with a  smile,
no replied with a giggle, HJs only.

Anyway got my kit off and onto the bed. I like this place as the rooms are nice bright and private - beds a big. Anyway onto the massage
she really work my should and got some kinks out. Always a bonus getting a good massage with a HJ. About 30 minutes in the tackle touches
started with light brushes around the crack around. This slowly increased until she had one hand on the balls and the other on the shaft - very nice.

Turnover time and as she was playing with the old fella she let me play with her tits. Blew everywhere and clean up time with tissues and towels.

She then gave me a head massage until time up - nice.

Over the last 4 weeks i have checked out Photara with mixed results....

Review 1: The MIB mind wipe.
I am greeted by 3 ladies at the desk and they are all quite attractive.   I ask for a 45 min massage but i am told that only 30 mins or 60 mins are available....  I said i haven't got an hour to spare but can manage 45 mins...  They speak in Thai to each other and then agree, yes, do i want 45 mins or 30 mins...

OMG...  I say 60mins  is fine.     

I am in the room and tell her up fron i am after a RNT and she says sure - extra $20.    Sure, and i give her the cash - all good.

The massage is exceptional and heaps of tackle tickle.  At the turnover she smiles really sexy and i am super keen and tell her i am really enjoying her massage.  Now at this point
i am just expecting the normal tug, but she kneels next to my waist on the table and i decide to put my hand on her hip/bum...   No problem !   in fact, thats when the best bit happened..

She then starts undoing the Belt on those baggy pyjamas they were and she struggles to lower the pants (so i help)....A bit of a gymnastic act and she has the pyjamaas around her kness and i am rubbing her pussy and ass through and inside her purple silk panties.

FUCK ME - she is loving it, i suspect getting herself off as well... this is way beyond expectation and i wasn't quite prepared, so peaked too early.  

Anyway, i asked her name afterwards and she told me, but about 10 sec's after that, while i am dressing, she pulls her top up and flaqshes me her tits with a sexy grin and says she will do Body to Body with me next time.

Now, that boobflash had the same effect as the mind wipe pen in the MIB (Men in Black) Movie and i can't remember her name.   FUCK ME DEAD - WHAT A TOOL.   

Hints...  5ft? Thai with a tight body and only works here 1 day a week.



Review 2:   Crooked

Back on the same day the next week and i try to look for the same girl for a special B2B.   Nobody around and i wait at reception for 5 mins...   So i dissapear for 30 mins and come back.
Only 1 person at the desk and she has crooked from teeth and quite tall (maybe 5ft10 ?)   I go through the normal routine (30 min session this time) and commentary and negotiate the RNT for $20. No problem.

Very good massage and some tackle tickle and under Hip rubbing (on me). Very good technique.   I am starting to warm up with her and she starts the rubntug... I reach up for the Tit, nope, she pulls away...   I reach for the but and she slides away a bit...  I give her a sad look and she says i can put my hand on her bum only...   Finish up, and am offered a shower... Excellent shower area, nice towels and a good way to finish.

No mind wip[e this time.  She said her name was "Flower" or something similar.


Review:  Oil Slick


I have racked my brain for the last few weeks trying to remember the first girls name from Review 1.   I decided to try and quizz the girls at the counter....   I am greeted by 2 hot Thai girls with great smiles and body language that screams "fuck me like the slut i am"  .... I say i need 60 mins and get fleeced $80......  I was hoping for some my luck to change today, but as fate would have it, I get the plain thai suited up massage girl.  Fast as you can see "Gotcha" i am led out of reception by her and into the room.   She says "ok you change"... So i strip down to my birthday suit, pull $20 from my wallet and sit on the bed facing the door with a full bar.

She comes back in and says lay down please while looking at my donga.  I say to her i want a handjob at the end and she says "yes" so i give her $20.  She gives an ok massage and i give her a few compliments during the massage to try and breakthrough the typical massage chicks armour.

About halfway through she starts with the oil.   I don't mind a bit and as im a bit hairy, a little extra is good - BUT fark me, it was like i was a stirrer in a vat of olive oil.  I was hoping that her running her hands over my naked body with oil would get her hot... No tackle tickle and 10 mins from the end i get told to turn over.

I turn over with a bar and she rubs my front... I am in pretty good shape and she was giving a better front rub then back.  Honestly, she was rubbing my 6 pack and my chest and then my cock.  She must have the will power of a saint because when i headed towards her tit for a slight caress, she says no and the same when i went for a bum squeeze.  DAMN !

She finished me off and runs out the room.   About 10 mins later i am still laying there in a vat of oil with a creamy top.

She gives me a quick wipe and says "thank you" and is gone...   What no shower????

She told me her name was  Katie.



ANYWAY i was on the way out and saw the roster on the counter, so poked my head over and saw the weeks roster...   I check some names and BINGO - the first girls name pops out and my memory is restored !   

I will let you know the name once i confirm it is her.....

Massage was good 7/10 she chatted all through the massage and flirted quite a bit.
On turn over let me uncovered and proceeded to play and tease then to a very good HJ.
During the HJ had a good feel through her cloths but never removed any clothing. I think f you saw her regular you may get more. Unfortunately don't get into city all that often.

Here comes the Boom....

So, I call last Thursday and book "Bom - pronounced boom"

I rock up and she is there waiting and introduces herself to me... She doesn't recognise me...   Damn...

We get into the room and I nude up. She comes back into the room and I mention a body to body session and she gives me that "undercover policeman" look...  No, she doesn't do that....  I explain that we had a session a week or two ago and she said it was something we could do next time...   She still has this blank look and says not here...

I was disappointed and she must have seen this look on my face...... She agreed to a HJ this session and then told me to go to 115 Pacific highway at north Sydney and we can get together for a better session.... 

This session was v good, and then then last Monday I popped into 115 for a "better session" -  see my review under 115...

Stealth, do you remember what day of the week you saw the oil-slick chick? Sounds like a girl I had there a while ago. How old was she, what did she look like? Trying to remember the name of a chick I had there.

date: Tuesday 17 September
place: Photara Thai
girl: Pui ( works  only  Tuesday)
 time:  half  hour  thai  massage

 feeling  stressed at  work I  decided to  get a massage with ahappy ending. called in advance to see  there  were two girls free. one was vivien (not good  on  previous experience)  so  decided  tip  go  ahead  with  the other, Pui.

 it  was  her  first  day  so  did  not know about the $20  deal.  but  she  agreed and  said  that  she'd  rather  Jack  me  off  now  and  give  the massage  late.  then  on  she  gave  one  off  the  best hj at photara with lot of ass play and  teasing.

 when it  came to  the  thai massage  she  it's a true pro.  didn't  watch  the  clock  but  gave a  very  good  massage. probably the  best person. unfortunately works  only on Tuesday.

seems like it must be best to call ahead here. i tried visiting without a booking a bit before lunch last week, doorbell rang as i entered but nobody was at reception. guess everyone was too busy gettin' busy in the back. ended up leaving after a few minutes of waiting. good policy not to interrupt a massage to answer the door, but why no reception staff??

I have since returned to this place and didn't book and got Orange - the cute little Thai girl that I have had before.
Paid for 1 hour as I had time to kill between meetings - sometimes it is good to finish an early. So paid my money
asked for the HJ and she said yep no worries. So stripped off and laid down on the bed and great massage started.
At about 30 minutes she climbed upon top to massage me and gave me a bit of a cat bath which was nice - returned
services are obviously a benefit with this girl - I think I have had her about 4 times now. Once she got down to the 
block and tackle a nice TT started and turnover time.
My hands started to roam and no complaint from her and as my hands headed south she undid those little trousers and let me
play with her pussy - very nice. Meanwhile she was working my cock and balls nicely until I blew everywhere.

Clean up and back on the street - just goes to show a bit of ground work sometimes pays off.

Person's Name : Ann (works Mon and Wed)

Establishment : Photara Thai

Date of Visit : 9/10/2013 (Wednesday)

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : as above

Hours of business: as above

Rates : $60 45 min + $20

Age : around 30

Size/shape : 8-10 with real c cups from what I could make out. 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : very yes

My experience/comments : hour spare in the city and thought I'd have a go here. Have been about 4 times now (I'll write those up later)

No booking and was shown to the room by Ann. Asked me to out a towel on which I did. 

As is typical here a great massage ensured. Without using too much oil. But frustratingly the towel remained on me. Great workout of my back and then moved onto the legs. Zero tackle tickle and I'm starting to get disappointed. 

Turnover time and the towel is placed over my bits. Still, the massage is great on the front of the legs but no attention is being paid to the tenting towel!

I'm then asked to sit up and she commences a shoulder massage. Finishes that and says she is "just going to get some how towels, unless....." And leaves the question hanging. 

Finally. 

I ask for the happy super relaxing ending and she nods that will be $20

Done

She commences a great HJ and I can't help but feeling that I shouldn't have out the towel on to begin with. She really knows what she's doing. 
Sadly here he clothes stay on as usual, would have loved a proper look at the goodies. Just as we finish I can hear someone come in and ask for her through the wall (I'm in the room near reception)

I pop and she finally goes to get the hot towels to clean up the oil. 

She gives me a little peck on the cheek and sends me on my way, with a whisper to come back on a Monday or Wednesday. 

Yes, I will

Person's Name : Som

Establishment : Photara Thai

Date of Visit : Wednesday, 9 October 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6/123 Clarence St, Sydney 02 9299 7575

Hours of Business : 10am - 9pm

Rates : 30mins / $50, 60min /$90 + $20 HJ

Age : 22-24

Size/shape : 5-6, A cups, skinny

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : R&T $20 for handie, wouldn't take clothes off

Value for money/recommend? : Yes with health care rebate otherwise only OK

My experience/comments : 

So you all know, this place does HICAPS so you can use your health care to get a 30 minutes Remedial Massage for $20 

Som is a very pretty young Thai girl.  She is very skinny from the look of her frame.  Polite and professional.

Gives a firm massage and knows where to look for the knots.  Not extremely strong if that's what you are looking for.

Chatty and friendly, she is open about her life in Sydney, family, past times.

I got completely naked for the massage and thought that would be enough of a hint to her that I wanted extras but in the end, I had to ask 

She said it would extra but didn't say how much.  Oiled me up and gave a competent handie.  It wasn't erotic but it wasn't bad either.  She looks you in the eyes when she does it and eventually gets you over the line.  Was kind enough to help clean me up and went to get hot towels to make sure all the oil as well as man juice was well and truly wiped up 

Got dressed and stopped her before she left the room so I could give her a $20 tip.  Would have given her more had it been better.

Would prefer a more erotic experience but it was a very cheap punt, I got an above average massage and was tugged by a pretty faced girl so can't complain  

If I was to return I would like to see someone else.  Som works 4 days a week.

Establishment : Photara Thai

Date of Visit : Monday, 14 October 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6/123 Clarence St, Sydney 02 9299 7575

Hours of Business : 10am - 9pm

Rates : $60 for 45min (which turned out to go for almost an hour)

Age : maybe just under 30

Size/shape : 8-10, but solid and tight.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : R&T $20 for handie, wouldn't take clothes off, no one really has here in my 5 visits.

Value for money/recommend? : Great, recommended.

My experience/comments :
After a good session to restore my faith in the old RnT (you can read my review of MCB). Initially tried Wish Away @ 30 Carrington Ave but walked away after being assigned the old mare sitting between 5 young thai babes!

Went in to Photara hoping to score a session with Orange after reading the previous reviews. Rocked up and asked for her, was told by the older woman on the desk that she was away and wasn't working today, but that Ann was available.

Sweet, I'd left her $30 for the handie last time in the hope of nurturing the relationship. Ushered into the room by the older woman who called out to Ann from the back of the shop. I know the drill and I nuded up face down on the bed. Ann came in shortly after and instantly recognised me from the week before. Success! Session went much the same except that the towel was ditched a little earlier and there was heaps of tackle tickle to keep me entertained. The massage from this one really is superb, a good proper working over.

Turnover time and she didn’t even ask. Commenced another superb HJ, starting slow and working her way up to a fast pace. This time she even jumped up on the table with me. Finished my squirts with her tightly grabbing the base of my dick like a cock ring. Awesome. The previous $30 tip must have paid off as I was granted plenty of access, even if the clothes still technically remained on.
Clean up time and she re-arranges her kit after my heavy grabbing ;p then commences a hand/arm massage. Places my hands on her tits and then goes to work on each arm, one at a time. Great stuff.

Looks down and sees that I’m still standing to attention. “Naughty boy”. Time is already almost 45min and I’m thinking damit, I could go again. Never mind that, she commences another awesome quick HJ, again cock ringing my dick. I jizz all over the place. Another clean up and she pops out to get the hot towels.

Back with the towels and she asks me to sit up for the shoulder massage. Time is seriously up, but I’m not complaining. Clean-up of the oil and she comes back with the plate of Mentos and water while I put my gear back on.

Tipped her the extra $30 to pay it forward for the next session  Cuddle and i'm out the door.

Massage 9.5 / 10
Facilities 9.5 / 10
Extras 8 / 10 (just can’t give more than 8 when the pants stay on)
Value 11 / 10 (this place just can’t be beaten in the city IMO)

Hi Megamaid thanks for the info re Ann offered a couple
of girls and remembered this review so went with her.

Popped in there today for quick 45 minute massage and
handy . You are right she really gets the kinks out - both
back and front. As is my way asked straight up what was on
offer and said HJ only $20. Standard pricing here.

Got my kit off and onto the bench with no towel, she
knocked and came in and saw me nude. Gave me a light smack
on the arse and said naughty boy and then put the towel over my
butt etc. She then worked the kinks out of my shoulders and the rest
of my body for the next 30 or so- really gets into the massage - great.
She then started the TT with a giggle-not sure if she was having a go at
the flaccid state of little C. Anyway after a little bit she had him looking 
more impressive-wasn't really difficult. Turnover time to give him a proper
work over. Does not take the kit off which is shame
as she has a nice rack. She did allow my hands to roam and
had my hands inside her top give lovely boobs a good play while she was
playing with my cock- nice. After about 5 minutes she had me over the line
and making a mess. Hot towel clean up and bit if shoulder massage with her
standing up on the bench and I was gone.

A definite recommendation both as a massage and HJ

This place always seems to delivery, I wonder who does their training? And

I here by offer to donate my body to this science.

Mate, glad you enjoyed. This place seriously has to be the pick for a great massage w/ RnT for the money they are charging. 

Didn't want to write it on the open forum, but now the restrictions are in-place.....
My last session with Ann had a little more than I let on. She got the tits out well and proper and shoved them in my face, something to look forward to on repeat visits! They are sensational.

My first two visits (I haven't written up, bad me, i couldn't even make the sound of the name she gave me so i gave up) weren't amazing. But the cheap price and review of Boom HERE got me back here for the 3rd time.

I tried my luck at Wishaway Massage down the road today. I'll write that up shortly, got my B2B.

Yaya provided one of the best massages i have ever had in terms of its remedial qualities. Firm and thorough she is not just there to move oil around your body.

Sufficient amounts of tackle tick whilst massaging the legs. In one strange twist for a RT joint she massaged legs first and then back.

On the flip i asked for extras and was told yes. Professional massage of the front of my legs followed then into a delightful HJ which involved both hands and her blowing air onto the tip of lil oz.

Wipe up , head massage and out the door relaxed as you can be from a quality massage with ultimate relief.

Ya ya works Tues and Fri!

Person's Name : Orange (works every day except tuesday, going back to Thailand until January after this week)

Establishment : Photara Thai

Date of Visit : Monday, 18 Nov 2013 

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6/123 Clarence St, Sydney 02 9299 7575

Hours of Business : 10am - 9pm

Rates : $60 for 45min + $20 for the handy

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : 6, not the prettiest face, but a fairly nice body.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : epic massage, pretty good clothed handy for $20

Value for money/recommend? : YES! Even though i'd prefer the slutty BOOM! or "extra access" An

My experience/Essay:
Some free time this afternoon and figured I'd have another attempt at road testing Orange. Rocked up and it turned out she was one of the girls at the font counter, great. Other one didn't look too great, didn't bother grabbing her name.

Shown into the room at the back on the left and spotted the lovely Ann in the utility room opposite. she had her back turned and didn't see me, Orange confirmed it was indeed An and asked if I wanted her. So polite! I told her I was her to see her not An this time, and she said "so you've been here before". "yep a few times, An is great"

Nuded up and lay face down on the generously sized tables. I love the facilities at this place. Top shelf. 

Fast Forward to the massage: It is seriously awesome, best i've ever had. Right amount of pressure in all the right places. I requested no oil for a change, so the towel got a serious work out. She had me pushed, pulled and compressed every which way possible. Really streched out my legs and used all of her body to great effect. I still feel amazing from it.

Only thing missing from the massage was the tackle tickle, there was nothing and she was very careful to keep my bits covered up, impressive given the variety of positions i found myself in. Nothing, not even a brushing!

However, as we neared the end she pointed to the tenting towel and asked if she should "massage this". YES PLEASE! finally

The usual fully clothed HJ commenced and my hands tried to go a wandering. She really wasn't going to allow me much at all. About all she'd give away was an arse grab. Totally warned off the boobies. Not sure if it was her, me or there are stricter rules here now. I hope not. HJ itself was good, slowly working me to climax while blowing on my cock. I blew back in no time just as she rimmed my arse with her finger. tidy.

She grabbed the tissues and mopped up, she wouldn't let me take a tissue and do any cleaning at all! "No i do!" haha, if you insist! She pops out and comes back with the hot towel for the last part of the clean up. I'll say it again, the failities here are top notch.

On go the clothes and out comes the $20. She teaches me how to say good bye and thanks in Thai. aww the sweety, but i've totally forgotten it now!

Massage 10 / 10
Facilities 9.5 / 10
Extras 6 / 10 HJ itself was good, but no access to any of her goodies and the clothes stayed on.
Overall she's highly recommended, but at this place she's in the middle of some serious competition so I'd actually prefer BOOM or An.

Been here a couple of times previously don't get into town all that often. Went in two girls at reception both very friendly both tiny. Shown to the room by Noc and ask if a wanted a drink.

Chatted to her during the massage which was a little difficult as her English isn't great. Her name Noc (not sure of the spelling) is a bird in Thailand and she has only been in the country 10 days but used to do massage back in Thailand. She is a very petit but attractive lady who seems to enjoy her work and is very friendly. The massage was superb (would rank in my top 10 of massages). On turn over she massaged my legs, arms and chest fully uncover which led to me getting hard the closer she got to the old fella. Ask her if she did HE and she yes and she ask for a tip but didn't specify an amount. The HJ was great and she let me touch he all over which she seem to enjoy but unfortunately the way she was dressed to made it difficult to remove any cloths which she seem hesitant (probably because she is new and others at this place often don't undress). Offered a shower which I refused as I was running late to meet some one. Massage 9/10, HJ 7/10, Looks 7/10. Highly recommended - Ask for Noc hopefully I got the name right it is difficult some times when their English isn't good. She said she works  4 days a week I don't remember which days Saturday has to be one.

Comments:
Keen to try out more of the girls here after reading the reviews of Boom. First two massages were pretty good, but the dumpy girl doing the HJ didn't really do it for me. 

Rocked up and was assigned a much cuter girl who turned out to be Boom. I was shown into the room after handing over the $60 for 45min and asked to nude up on the bed. 

Massage started and was pretty good. This didn't last too long as Boom was giving it heaps of tickle between the legs and between the arse crack. I responded to this and the massage was over!

"Naughty boy" was the cry from boom and she asked me to turn over. HJ was great and she allowed plenty of access to her goodies, managed to get my hand down her top, but clearly wouldn't get any of her kit off.

I came in no time as she was getting her slutty talk on. Cleaned up and she went to commence the massage again, but noticed that I was still at full mast "ohh you want more?"

I just smiled and enjoyed the next handy! She turned up the slutty talk this time. Probably had the opposite effect on me though as I'm not really into that. Still, boom knows her stuff and I was over the line with my hands down her top. 

Cleanup and we've still got 20min to go! I turn over face down to re-start the massage, which it very good. She works the back and legs well. Probably a little too heavy on the oil, but no major complaints. But on turnover to do the front of the legs it's clear that middle stump is ready to go again. 

Boom ignores the massage and commences the final HJ in expert fashion, loading up on the slutty talk. I totally drain what's left on the sack (at this point not much!) as she rims me with her other hand. 

Final cleanup with the super hot towels and I'm out the door. 

Great girl.

I'm 80% certain it was on a Thursday, but that was back in September. Might be worth calling them. Boom is a must visit along with An. I see one other reviewer also saw her on a Thursday. 

Hopefully this place doesn't suffer from all the negative press. They're paranoid enough here.

Person's Name : Orange (normally works every day except tuesday, going back to Thailand on Saturday)

Establishment : Photara Thai

Date of Visit : Tuesday 28 Nov 2013 

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6/123 Clarence St, Sydney 02 9299 7575

Hours of Business : 10am - 9pm

Rates : $80 for 45min + $20 for the handy

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : revised to 6/8 size, not the prettiest face, but a fairly nice body.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : so so massage, so so clothed handy for $20

Value for money/recommend? : value is there. Would no longer recommend. 

My experience/Essay:
I'll skip the details about the place and the girl. Has all been covered many times and is the same. This time I opted for the oil massage. 

Massage, while being better than most places wasn't nearly as good as the non oil option i had the week prior. Very weak. And I was mostly there for the massage after shooting my load in a big way the day before at VIP69. 

It was overly oily and very light. Ignoring my request for "only a little bit of oil". With the same movements repeated for 5minutes. There was however much more tackle tickle this time so I was hopeful that the HJ would be right around the corner. It wasn't and the massage continued for 45min. I was nearly bored and barely tenting. 

Finally the middle stump massage is offered and I accept. This time she was even less interested and wanted me over the line quickly. Very mechanical this time. 

I blew and she did a basic cleanup with the tissues then offered a head massage which I declined. She applied even more oil to my arms and hands then massaged those, very lightly. 

Little M is still standing up and this time I'm a little more forwards in asking for the second course. It is denied and she starts a foot rub. Boo. 

After this she goes and gets the hot towels/water/refreshments. Wipes the oil off my back quickly with one towel, points to the other one and says "for you to clean up"
Fuck me this one is getting lazier. Perhaps already thinking about her trip. 

I try and clean up the oil slick as best I can with the remaining towel. There is oil everywhere on my legs, arms, crack and front. The little towel struggles and I'm forced to get changed with a shitload of oil remaining in my "hard to reach" places. She's watching me at this point and I feel like I'm a bother to her day. She's not impolite or anything and seems very friendly still. Just lazy. Totally unlike my last visit. 

I won't be seeing her again.

my experience/comments:

Since there is a fair bit of traffic from punters at the joint recently, thought I will pay a visit as it has been months since my last venture here.

Straight after work, early Tuesday evening I entered the premises, there was a cute thai girl at reception and was thinking I will be quite happy if she was the chosen ML. I opted for the 1 hour Oil, paid the $ 80 and we both were walking towards the back rooms where I was allocated a shortish ML, I mean, I am not really a tall guy but she was chest high compared to me.

She greeted with me with cute smile and we entered a room. Really spacious room, neat and tidy, I forgotten how well presentable this joint is, looks totally legit and you can get a nice hand relief at the end of the massage, should be more places like it..

Anyway, enough of that..so, we were in the room and was asked what type of massage I would like, as I mentioned to the ML receptionist, 1 hour Oil thanks..she mentioned ok an asked me to remove my clothes. But since I just finished work, was hanging for a shower, but strangely she explained to me in her own type of broken English that is better if you do a shower after the massage. Strange remark, I thought, but I asked again that I really wanted to take a shower, she replied back to me again, 'Better after massage..'.

Okay then, after it would need to be, I started to remove my clothing and was asked if I wanted water or tea, I replied back.'Better after massage..'. She did do a slight giggle and quietly said that she will be back soon. At least this ML appears to have a sense of humour which is always a good sign. 

I was naked on the massage table when she returned back to the room, she brought in with her a tray with a cup of water, tea and a handful of mentos. 

She asked how hard I would like my massage, I replied with 'hard as you can.. and to focus on my shoulders , lower back, hips and the bum area, 'ok' she said,'I can do that for you..'

No towel was placed on my back and started with the introduction Remedial from my shoulders and down to my legs, nice start, with her small frame, she was basically had her hands on knees moving up my back, she wasn't a heavy girl,  however she was trying to press hard on my troubled area that needed more attention.

Then the oil came on, long strokes from my shoulders to my waist/hips, this was contusing for at least 5 mins, then another 10 mins in focussing around my hips and bum. No sign of her hands or fingers sliding into my bum crack, but just the feel of her hands rubbing my bum chicks was enough to make me feeling hot and horny.

While she was doing this, we were taking about the usually ML chatter, how long you have been here, where do you go to school, and do you live in the city?..etc, etc. she only been in Australian for 8 months . I think she said 8 months, he English was not the best, but she was trying to make legitimate conversation with me, cudos to her, really made the point she would like to speak 'better'' English..ahh, she had that 'better' down to art!
Then she started to teach some Thai phrases which honestly I really wasn't in the mood as at that point I was really in relax mode. She started to massage my legs, no touching or brushing my ball sac or my penis, although, she did come back to massage my lower bum cheeks which was again refreshing..

So, I was asked to turnover and on come with that damn towel covering my waist line, hmm, what's with the towel business, I noticed it was the 40 minute mark, while she was massaging my front legs I asked the question for 'special'. She asked if that's what I want, Of course I replied with 'Yes please....' 

She obliged, that damn towel was removed and proceeded to apply oil to my erected penis and started with light tugging strokes. One hand she was using to tug me, her other hand rubbing my balls, this was really getting me hot as I mentioned to her. 

She leaned her body against the edge of the massage table which allowed my left hand go wandering around her petite body. My fingers was pressing firmly under her crouch area, she kept going and I was pressing firmer when I managed to slightly inserted my index finger (over her pants) up her crouch area, she didn't pull away, so I kept going, she was kind of groaning and appeared she was liking it. Was ready to reach climax, so I moved my hand to touch her breasts, I was able to touch her nipples underneath her bra, only for a little while before she moved my hand away with her shoulder. So I closed my eyes and was waiting for the fireworks to begin, I exploded with vigour, my juices hitting her arm and catching a fair bit on her sleeve...Oops, that couldn't be helped..

I told her I was sorry about the messy part but she had no hard feelings towards me, but yeah, damn good HJ it wasshe wiped me with tissues and wiped down her sleeve where the damage was done.

Told me she was coming back with the hot towels, wiped my front good and proper and asked her If can now take a shower, she said..'okay, you now take shower' .

Nice shower amenities indeed, really enjoyed it after the massage. I came back on the room got dressed and gave her $30, she thanked me for the tip, and I thanked her for great session we just had and told me come back soon.

Before I left the room, drank the lukewarm tea which was a nice fruity flavor,quite nice.

While leaving, she thanked me in Thai at last a few times and off I went.

Looks like I will be back soon to see Koh again, ( I'm sure that was her name..). I would like to test the waters with this ML again, she might be a pocket size but I see potential.

Think Big.

Fancied a good massage prior to the action this day so opted for Photara.  Phoned ahead and booked Noc on the basis of the review above.  Shown to room and got nude and laid down with out wearing a towel.  Noc entered and proceeded to cover me up  Then gave a brilliant 80 minute hard massage.  No tt at all either back of front despite going close and carefully draped me the whole time.  Was really surprised and frustrated by this based on the above reviews, particularly as i was rock hard.  After finishing the massage she then whispered the magic words "d i want special massage?" Said yes like a little kid asking for sweets! SHe then finally removed the towel and got to work.  Now this was a good but slightly different hj in that whilst stroking my cock with her left hand she grabbed underneath my left thigh and kept pulling my left leg towards her (she was standing on my right).  Wasnt sure what her aim with this was but I took it as a reason to grab her ass and massage her pussy outside of her massage clothes.  This made her pull my leg towards her even more! All in all a good and different hj experience although would have liked the massage to be a little bit more risque.

Left Virgin Active this Fri afternoon and really felt like getting the muscles massaged so headed to Photara.  3 pretty hot girls sat at reception.  Shown to room by the one with the smallest frame who had one of those really sexy thai vocies but I just couldnt make out her name and didnt want to be rude by asking her repeatedly.  Lay down nude.  She came back into the room and proceeded with the usual good photara massage and was quite chatty.  Really loved her accent! No actual tt but came very close on numerous occasions.  Turned over and massaged my front without a towel and again never touched the goods but dont know how she didnt!.  After massaging my legs she offered hj which was excellent.  didnt attempt any other extras or even touched her but definitely will next time.  She works thursday and fridays.

Date of Visit : tues 10/12/2013 

Contact Details/Address: 123 Clarence street, Sydney (02) 9299 7575 Photara Thai Massage Sydney | Wynyard Sydney CBD 

Hours of Business : 10:00am to 9:00pm Mon to Friday 

Rates :	$80/ 60 Minutes + extras $10 remedial, $30 HJ

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : a/b size cup breast, size 6, height maybe 5 ft nothing. Pretty

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai. Bangkok. 

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? Yeah ok. Massage great. HJ good but not amazing. 

Essay:
Writing my review of MCB this morning got me in the mood. Convincing me that I needed a good massage after a week off the rub. Settled on Photara Thai knowing that the massage would, as always, be first class. 

Rocked up and was assigned Winnie by the very vey cute mamasan. Winnie is a cute little thing. I got naked and she got started. Massage was sensational. I kept asking for increased pressure. Which apparently means the "remedial" type massage and another $10. Fine.    Massage is great. Oil time and the perfect amount is applied. Enough to get things moving without any excess. She expertly does my back and shoulders than moves down to the legs. She's pleasant and keeping up a reasonable conversation. Teaches me how to say "good" in thai: Deee

Fun fact: 
Photara Thai Massage is owned by the same people as "Pure Massage". Explains why Boom works both places. 

More Fun Facts:
Turns out that Winnie also works at Harmony in St Leonards( can't remember which days) and Serenity in Crows Nest (one week day I can't remember and Saturdays).  But doesn't do the "Pure Massage" type of service. That's a shame. 

Back to the review. 

She's down and working on the legs. Real hard massage. Hurts like hell and I want to tap out, but I'm loving it. Very very slight ball brushes.  Turnover and the towel is put away. MiniMaid is bolt upright but being a little ignored as the great massage continues. Slight brushing of the balls again but she move off the legs and onto the shoulders and head massage. Not entirely unhappy as the massage is great. 

Eventually we approach the end of the session. Looks like I'm on my way without the tug! So I ask about the happy ending. Sure thing, how much do you want to pay? "$20" I offer. She says $30 will do it. Ok. 

HJ is good enough. But she's very uninvolved. Nothing like Ann or Boom. I'm over the line, cleaned up and out the door. Maybe I need to see her at serenity for a bit more action.

Value for money/recommend? : Great, recommended.

My experience/comments :
Has been covered all before. This was a superb visit with outstanding massage. This time she didn't bother trying with the towel. 30min up and then she asks if I'd like "the other leg massaged" hell yes!

Start by working my shaft slowly and letting my hands go a wandering. I start with those fine C cups and then I'm working her clit through the pants, she seems to be loving it. 

Works me to a climax and I jizz in a big way. However, Anna remembers that I like I have a few goes and keeps her hand on my cock. She's straight into round 2 and starts working MiniMaid slowly. This time she's a bit more forward and turns slightly, grabs my hand and pushes it into her clit. I take the instructions and work her. I can feel her juicing up through the pants. God she's loving it now. 

She's a little more reluctant than last time. But eventually we have the tits half out and in my mouth. I'm furiously licking the nipple and almost forgetting the downstairs stimulation she has asked for ( I really can only do 1 thing at a time). 

Eventually I jizz again and it's clean up time. She's off and then returns with the hot towels for the wipe down. Glorious! Tip her the $25 and I'm on my way. 

Can't recommend this girl enough. 

Fun fact: Bom is now working Fridays.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : R&T $20 for handie, wouldn't take clothes off. Good access to the rack though. 

Value for money/recommend? : Yeah ish, but with a warning. 

My experience/comments :
Rocked up hoping to see Anna. Not around so went with this girl. New face I hadn't need before. Turns out she's only very new, day 1. 

Into the room and motions for yme to get on the table while she ducks out to get the hot towels. I nude up to get on the table. She walks in and seems a bit surprised to see me totally nakked. Oh well, not a grey first sign. I was more here for the massage today actually. 

Massage starts and it's fairly week. Ask for more pressure. And keep asking for more till it's good. Bit more of a language barrier with this one. But we get there in the end and the massage is good. No tackle tickle. She appreciates that I've taken the time to learn how to say good "dee" in thai and a bit of rapport develops. I ask to skip the shoulders an concentrate on the lower back and legs, instructions aren't really understood though. No tackle tickle at all on the massage. 

Turnover and MiniMaid is being carefully avoided. Fortunately the massage is good. Mini is kept upright by the better views down the top of I-ee-la but we're fast approaching the end of the massage time. She asks me something I have not idea about and I simply nod. Turns out I've just said yes to the application of some kind of dencorub substance to be smeared all over. Oh shit. But oh well, and I go along with it. 

Eventually I need to ask the question in the form of indicating towards mini. She understands this and nods rather enthusiastically. Success! She (it turns out insufficiently) cleans her hands of the heat rub and commences a rather good HJ. Everything is going well and I'm letting my hands wander a bit. Enough to get them right down her top and into her bra. Having a great old time with the good natural c cups. 

Then it starts. 

The burning. 

A little a first and I realise there is still enough of the heat cream on her hands that it's being transferred onto MiniMega. It actually feels kinda good and I end-up blowing big time. This is different and not so bad I'm thinking. 

We clean up and she pops out to get the towels. The burning continues to escalate and by the time she's finished the final cleanup with the hot towels it's really getting uncomfortable. "Hot Rod"

Tip her the 20 an I'm out onto the street. I pick up a tube of dencorub from Coles I case I need a cover story for later. God it's uncomfortable now, walk back to work an I'm at my desk a good hour before the pain goes down. The smell lasts all day though!

Overall good. But I wouldn't recommend the heat treatment if you want the happy ending. If they pull out a clear jar of cream with some white thai writing on the side say "no!"

Comments
It has been awhile since I have been here so thought I would stick my head in the door to see what was what. It was about 11.30
and there was only one girl available - or so I was told. So took Jenny and went to the room made the payment for the massage and
then asked if HJ or anything else on offer - paid the $20 for the HJ. She left with the cash and I stripped and jumped up onto the bed. A little knock
and in she walked, she had a little chuckle when she saw that I was naked on the bench and picked up a towel and covered me. She
then climb up onto my back and gave a good firm massage and was getting the kinks out. She then removed the towel and applied oil to
me and worked more on my shoulders and lower back - very nice. She then moved to my butt and started a little bit of a TT which got a rise
out of me. At this stage I was very happy.

Turnover time and she start a very limp HJ - it was like she hadn't given one before - I am sure if she has worked here long enough she would have given plenty.
I described what I like - but it was hard as her English was pretty poor. She eventually got the hang of it  and I blew a big load and clean up with hot towels and off.

Walked into this place tonight without any AXR intel, it looked too legit and the HICAPS rebate chart on the counter led me to believe it was legit so turned around and walked out.
Have any punters been able to get a HE on Medicare/Insurance?

Value for money/recommend? : ok still recommended. But there are better MLs here. 

My experience/comments :
In need of a very high quality massage so rocked up here. Girl on the front desk was the only one avail so no choice. Had seen her before but hadn't had a session yet so I figured what the hell. 

All the single rooms were in use and she showed me into the double room at the back. Then left me for what seemed like ages while I lay nakked on the table. Massage starts and it's superb. Not quite as good as Anna, but still excellent. I attempt to get talking but there is a big language barrier. 

Did get out of her that she's northern thai. And only works at this shop. 

Massage is continuing but it's never sensual at all and she's keeping me covered with the towel for the first 40min. Eventually the towel is ditched and there is the slightest of tackle tickles before it's turn over time. 

Towel is straight back on for the front massage of the legs. Damn the massag is good. We approach the home straight and she make the universal HJ sign with her hand. I nod and she says it will be an extra $20. 

HJ is ok. I've had a lot worse. But it's not great either. Eventually I blow and she cleans me up. Pops out for the hot towels and cleans up even more and I'm dressed and out the door. 

Jesus I like this place for a quality massage.

I went and tried today. I walk in and there are two ladies sitting at reception, one slim and one more curvy. I say 'hello, is Anna available?'. The curvy one gives me a funny look and doesn't answer right away. Eventually I say 'are you Anna?'.  Yes she says and cracks a joke about her obviously being available as she is sitting there doing nothing.

I pay the $45 for half hour and say sorry its been a while since I've been here. Anna admonishes me in mock consternation and says well at least you remembered my name. Mind you I'd be very impressed indeed if she remembered me- after all I never set foot in the place before today .

So we go into the room and I won't do a full review, but basically it was 15 minutes of massage and at turn over time Anna starts a long slow tease and HJ. Interesting MO, she got up on the table with me and looked me in the eyes and said sexy things until I finished. Reminded me of a shop I went to in Shenzhen last year. Even same in the way the girls had pink uniforms, lay on the table with you and allowed a bit of a feel through and under their uniform (but not nude).

Anyway I digress. Anna was friendly and cute and yes good at what she does. Nothing like having a sexy girl pamper you. She was keen to drum up business for herself and suggested I book her next time- said it twice. No problem if I have the chance i'll be back. 

Thanks especially to Megamaid for the review(s). Cheers.

When I finally left the office on last Thursday night, it was reported on the Sydney Trains website of trains delay due to 'malfunction' incident somewhere on the network. So, rather than waiting for my next available train to arrive, I decided for a 30minute session with hand joint nearby.

Originally, I headed for Snow Lotus@ corner of Eskine & Kent sts, but apparently had no answer, time was a bit after 7:30pm, most probably all booked for the night.

So, plan B was to head towards Photara Thai. Been a while since I have been to this joint, wasn't anticipating anything over the top, just needed a good release.

I walked into the premises and noticed the two ladies sitting down behind the reception desk. One skinny faced ML and the other chubby faced.

Wasn't fussed which ML to use, after paying for a 30 minute session to the skinny ML,  the chubby looking ML asked me to follow her to one of the back rooms. This particular ML was Anna, the descriptions of her from previous posts were on the mark.

Entered the room and was asked to strip down and lay on the table. To be honest, wasn't really in the conversational mode but Anna is the type of girls that liked the chatter. So, I went along her line in all the various topical banters she raised wit me purposely.

Back here, she oiled me up and provided me with a competent aromatherapy massage, long strokes from neck to my bum. Focussing around my arse cheeks and slightly gliding her fingers across my crack which kind off got little TBM awake . Then she moved her hands around the inside of my upper legs and slight brushing of my private parts which is such a lovely feeling.

After 10 minutes of massage time, was told to flip over and by then I was total erected which caught Anna's eyes and asked the question if I wanted a front massage or if I wanted a bit more relaxation 'down there..'.  I said yes of course and asked If I was willing to pay a bit extra which was a 'no brainer..' 

Anna then applied more oil n my shaft and proceeded with a soft and slow rubbing of my balls and moved up my shaft and then focusing in rubbing my head and making me so farken horny which I made the comment while looking her in her face. 

The tugging repetitions increased more, suddenly she sat on the table to lay beside me while she was still tugging me. She put her face practically towards me whoich allowed me in kissing her neck and cheeks. Then she started to lick one my nipple and told her I wanted to do the same to her. She leaned up and was able to loosen her top which allowed me to take out her breasts from out her bra and a had a good 5 minutes in sucking both of those luscious melons. 

This was all happening while she still tugging me, I then placed my right are around her arse was able to press firmly against her pussy (while clothed on..), to the point I could and could feel some ;little moisture down there with all the finger rubbing she allowed me kiss around her neck again then a couple of kisses on her lips.  

I told her I was about to cum and she increased her tugging repetitions which led to an awesome release, blew my load gracefully, felt damn good.

Anna proceeded with a thorough tissue clean up and the final clean up layer with warm towels from chest to legs. 

In total, I handed over to Anna a $30 tip which is a tad higher what the ML's expect here, but I was happy to provide this amount as I was satisfied with the services provided.

Thanked her for the nice session and gave her a nice kiss on her lips. I was told to come back soon and will be worth the visit if I will stay longer. I guess the only the way to find out this is BS or not is to swing pass for another session with dear Anna. 

Overall, I left the premises happy. Anna work schedule is Monday to Thursdays.

My experience/comments :

This girl has fair skin and quite pretty. Very skinny and flat. 

She ushered my into a room, which was the 1st good sign. Privacy. So I decided to take it all off. I lay down with the towel over me. She did the usual asked how I wanted it. I said hard. She started wiping my feet down and worked up my calves then thighs. She lifted the towel to see I wasn't wearing any jocks so she just ripped the towel off and threw it on the ground. Great! Good sign #2

Worked my back and the she asked me to turn over. As I did, she asked if I was she and wanted the towel back? Good sign #3

She continued and then said she'll be back with towels and time seemed up...

I had to stop her and ask if there were any extras. Straight away she said $20 cash only. Bit confronting, but I said yes. She poured oil all over and went at it. I grabbed her ass and she seemed to let me. So I tried to grab her boobies and whoa. She moved away so quick I thought a rat ran past.

But, surprisingly I went to her again a few weeks later and she started joking around saying you want me to get you cooking etc?

Person's Name : Ping pong (seriously had to ask her 4 times cause I didn't believe her. It must be what she goes by.)

 Age : 26

 Size/shape : Size 8 c Cups

 Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

Ping pong had darker skin and medium length hair. She didn't seem "fat" but pretty solid.

These ladies must be trained the same way. They ask if you've been here before, always say yes. They lift up the towel and if your not wearing anything, they just whip the towel away and throw it away.

She was personable, bit chatty. Massage was just average. I man scaped and she commented, did you shave. I said yes and she liked. She said she did too, so I asked are you going to show me? She undid her pants and pulled her undies down at the front. I said I wanted to feel how smooth it was and she let me! So I went in deeper and was very surprised. All the angles were wrong and was really awkward trying to slip my hand down her pants while she was working on me. I just lay back and tried to put my hand down her shirt and she let me!

She wouldn't take her clothes off so it was difficult, but it was awesome. Ping pong. Easy to remember she says...

Popped in here today. The place looks legit, can even claim it on insurance by the looks of it.
Didn't get the name of the girl, got a 30 minute massage for $45, she was clothed and used a towel to cover up parts of my body she wasn't massaging. No hint of extra services at all and thought I may be walking out disappointed. 30 minutes later and she got to the bit in the routine where they make the clappy noise on your back which signals massage is over then says thank you and on my way. Thought I may as well ask for extras, the worst is that she can say is no, but happily she asked for $20, oiled up my cock and wanked me off til I came.
All very mechanical and fully clothed so not worth it in my opinion. Massage was good, but I'm not here for that

Popped in last Saturday-  11am.

Only one girl available - cookie.  She was the normal type of looking Thai girl here.  I asked for the special at the start and she nodded.  I nuded up and got about a 20min massage and then did the turn over.  She then point to my cock and said special.   

Sure baby !

She then did a nice sack and dick rub.  I gave her bum a squeeze and she was ok with that.  I then rubbed her tits over the top of her PJ's and she was ok with that..  Pulled away when i tried to undo her top.  But Hey, you gotta try.....

After 5 mins, i slipped my hand through the side and massage her tits through her bra and manage a finger behind her bra and flicked her nipple.  Was sorta ok with this as she knew i was close..

Anyway,  only charged $20 for the tug at the end, so good value all up  $65, for rub/tug and some playing.

Haven't been here in ages - apologies for being a slack arse
and not using the template. Anyway rocked up 
and had Nat a very pretty girl with a great set
of personalities . Any way paid for 30 minutes stripped
and onto the table. She walked in covered my  butt with
a towel and started the massage. To be honest better girls
here ie Anna for example. Turnover time - no hint of TT -
asked if HJ or anything else on offer. HJ 20 - nude 50.  First time
I have been offered that here. Paid my pineapple and she stripped
to show a very nice body with C cups. The HJ started and immediately
it was like she wanted me to cum in 2 minutes - no style no ball play
just yank the old fella as fast as possible to make me cum ASAP. Said
slow down we still have time, she said you cum now. Grabbed her hand 
slowed it down and started to play with her body - I did ask first and she said fine .
A minute later she ups the ante and says cum now you have 10 minutes to go. Jeez
here we go again and I said slow down and then she got cranky with me. So let her
continue until I came and then clean up and gone.

On the whole not the best girl here others are better, but she did get her kit off

My experience/comments :

I was in the city after finishing work early and I didn't what to do to kill time. I walked pass Photara Thai and remember reading about it here. Went in an enquired if Anna was working and they said "no, not today". But I was already a tad horny then so I just say fine, 30 minutes relaxing massage. The massage itself was pretty decent if you like soft massages. Lots of "accidental" touches in the bottom regions. After that, she asked me to flip over and proceeded to massage my arms and asked if I wanted to hj. I said sure and asked her how much was it to take off her clothes. She replied that they don't do that here. So fine, she looked bored as I took awhile to finish and she didn't look too interested nor was there much technique. It got me over the line and then she cleaned me up a little and went out to get some hot towels to clean me up. She cleaned my back and arms up and gave me a hot towel to clean myself down there. A tad awkward but okay.... sure..... tipped her $20 on the way out.

I'm not too sure of her name but that's what she said. She wasn't overly talkative or friendly. Merely answered the questions I asked her. Won't be going back there anytime soon.

Person's Name : Gypsy

Establishment : Photara Thai

Date of Visit : 3/2/2015

Rates : $45 for 30 minutes

Age : mid 20s?

Size/shape : slim petite

Nationality or Ethnicity : Northern Thai

Services Provided : Massage, HJ 

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments :
I was in the area and thought I would go back and see if I could get Anna - she gives a great massage and tug etc. Rang and asked if Anna was available and they
said yes so made a booking -  sweet. Well when I rocked up at the time, they said that someone had taken my booking... Was that you Megamaid I know you love this girl 

Anyway the girl behind the counter was available and she was friendly and quite pretty to look at, so I said OK for 30 minutes and paid my money and went to the first room. Stripped off
and got onto the bed and waited on her return - which was very quick. She returned with a hot towel and massaged my feet, which is the norm here - obviously some of you fellas have smelly feet
 as mine smell of roses or something better than a dead animal. 

She then starts the pressing massage - feet, legs and back etc - pretty average for this place to be honest. She continues this for around another 5 minutes or so and starts the oil massage and 
she asked how hard - Medium is my response. For the next few minutes it is pretty much a push massage - just moving the oil around. Asked if she could press harder and on my shoulders as well. She said OK, but nothing changed so I let it go - this girl is either lazy or doesn't know how to massage, which as I said is unusual for this place. So she moves from my shoulders down to my crack and thighs - no TT here and then down to my calves - more oil. The next minute she disappears and returns with a hot towel to remove all the oil that she has pushed around my body.

Turnover time and I am buck naked with little C just lolling around and still no attention - not even a question from her. So I ask if anything is on offer and she said HJ $20 - OK lets see what you got girl. She oils up little C
and when I say oiled I mean oiled -  Exxon Valdez didn't loose as much oil as this girl used on my cock. She started a slow HJ and ball tickle which was OK without being anything fantastic. Asked if I could touch and she said butt OK but if I wanted to touch her tits through the robe $40 - WTF touching through robe for $40 no way - your body ain't that good. So the tug continued with me feeling her butt and then she said your time nearly up - you cum now. Man that buggers the mood, so she quickened her pace and I eventually blew. Clean up with a hot towel and gone.

In summary Gypsy works Mondays and Tuesdays and while OK to look at doesn't know how to look after a fella very well and her massage is average. So while I will return to Photara for Anna I am not certain on the other girls as my last 2 punts here have been disappointing.

Photara is most definately not an FS shopé. Never heard of them offering to nude up right off the bat, usually takes a few punts and a good relationship to get that far.

Only girl i know who also does the work at pure massage is "Boom", but i haven't seen her at Photara for a long time, and i only got to sample her delights the one time. She's awesome if you can get her, but so is Anna. Try and steal a booking off curly69  

I swear it wasn't me.... this time. I'd have no problems stealing any Anna bookings!

MR C&B agree some of these girls nip across the bridge for extra dollars and services. But given Gypsy's attitude I wouldn't make the trip for her.

Photara is definitely not a FS place as Mega said you usually have to put in some leg work to get the girls to nude up. The only girl I know who did
it straight off the bat was Nat

I've been to Photara about 3-4 times. Every time has been pretty good - decent massage, followed by a RnT that was usually clothed - but the last time, with Anna, was very sexy.

RnT is included in the price, so no haggling if you're happy with a young, clothed, Thai girl pulling your dick until you come.  But a couple will do it topless for a few bucks more.

Anna - a bit plump but very sexy - pretended she wouldn't, said she couldn't take off her clothes, but when I pushed a bit, said that I could take off her clothes...

I pulled off her top, her pants, he sexy bra, and let loose her massive tight tits. She let me suck on them. I asked for DATY, but she said no, if she did that she'd want to fuck me! No problem, I thought.

She talked, moaned, and was in general an excellent and sexy RnT girl.

Value for money/recommend? : for the most part yes

My experience/comments : after reading reviews on her thought I would give it a go. Very nice establishment. Clean and tidy and professional. Thought it wasn't going to happen no take tickle no attention downstairs during what was a very good massage with just a town covering. Turned over and towel had just slightly fallen to the side. Still nothing. Then she says, with a slight giggle, massage there and points. I said sure. $20 required and would only let me grab backside. Nothing else. HJ was actually enjoyable. 

Asked about anna as previously reviewed on  thia site and was told she doesn't work there anymore??

Overall I am going to go back. shop would easily pass as a legit shop. OK price and right around the corner for work. Better options out there but this place is super professional and gets the job done.

Tony, a pity you did not ask reception who you had just seen. Reviews without a name are not really much use to our members are they?

Person's Name : Ice

Establishment : Photara Thai

Date of Visit : 11/3/2015

Rates : $45 for 30 minutes

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : solid but not fat

Nationality or Ethnicity : Northern Thai

Services Provided : Massage, HJ 

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :
I was walking past on the way back from a meeting when I felt the need to have a massage and a tug. Walked in and all the girls were taken except Ice who was working the front
desk. She has a pretty face and a nice smile and definitely a little bit more curvy than some of the other thai lasses. Paid for 30 and we headed down to the room at the end on the left.
She left me and I stripped and left $20 on the little table and climb onto the bed. She came in with the little hot towel and saw the $20 and giggle and said you have been here before.
Said many times but haven't seen you yet.

She used the hot towel on my feet as they always do and then put a towel over me to begin the dry massage. Her massage technique is great and she found a knot in my lower back that she
worked on and then continued up to my shoulders. This went on for around 10 minutes and then she removed the towel and put on a bit of oil my body and started a nice oil massage which include a bit
of TT when she got to my upper legs and thighs. Turnover time.

She then put the towel over my cock and climbed up between my legs and started to oil up the front of my legs and started long strokes that ended with her playing with my cock through the towel -  bit weird but felt nice.
After a couple minutes of this I had a full hard on and she remove the towel and she then put a little bit of oil on my cock and started with a slow tug using both hands. Nice. She then removed one of her and started with a bit
of arse play - this is a first at this place. She saw me smile and she continue her efforts, this slow teasing went on for another 5 minutes and then she climbed off the bed and stood next to me and smiled. She started up again doing the
exact same thing but this time I was allowed to play with her body - outside of clothes only. She has a nice firm and round butt which I stroked and then moved my hands up to her tits which she didn't mind me playing with. I was able to slip my hands
inside her top and she didn't mind as long as I was gentle. Asked if she would take off her top and she no never not allowed at this place. So I continued the playing on the outside and she slowly increased the pace and bought me to the edge and then
slowed back down -  definitely knows what she is doing. She did this a couple more times and I blew a great big wad of goo - which she said very strong man. Clean up with the hot towel and a bit of head massage and gone.

From memory Ice works Monday and Wednesday and she also works at a "Normal" massage joint when I asked her as I thought she may work at 115 - she said I had to go to Photara if I wanted any fun.

Date of Visit : 31 March 2015
Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Photara Thai Massage Sydney | Wynyard Sydney CBD
Hours of Business : Monday - Friday 10am - 9pm | Saturday 10am - 5pm | Sunday Closed
Rates : $80 for one hour massage + extras
Age : 25?
Size/shape : Tall, thin, strong, pretty. Perfect perky tits. Pretty sure she's a ladyboy.
Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai
Services Provided : Excellent massage. $20 HJ, $30 topless HJ
Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 
As I posted above, I've been here a few times. I find it a reliable, predictable experience in that they give a proper Thai massage (which I want) and a consistent HJ option. Last night I had an hour to kill before meeting friends, so I popped in.

Nisha is, I think, a ladyboy. She's taller than most Thai girls I've seen, with strong angles to her face, a very firm massage, and a very lean, almost muscular upper body. This doesn't bother me as long as she's pretty (she was), gives a good massage (she did), and does the HJ in the way I like (she did). And I could easily be wrong. 

As the excellent massage moved to the final stages, following the rollover, she asked me if I wanted extras. I said definitely. I asked for naked but she said she'd only remove her top. Her very hard, lean torso had two perfectly formed perky tits: everything was just so tight and sculpted that it made me think "ladyboy" (but to be honest, she was pretty enough that it was only at that stage that it entered my mind).

Nisha oiled up my cock and balls and started rubbing, sitting alongside me on the table, letting my rub her tits. Once she got me hard I asked her to rub my balls and my asshole with one hand, while rubbing her tits with her other hand, and I continued jerking myself off. When I got close I asked her to finish the jerking and spray me all over my myself. Hot.

-Important Photara Thai Update-

It is with a heavy heart that I inform AUX members of the following tragic information. Recently uncovered when I rocked up to see my favorite ML after spending too much time away from the Sydney RnT scene. 

Anna has left the shop!


Apparently is was 2 months ago. The girls were unable to tell me if she's gone to another shop or back to Thailand.

I went to this joint again cause it's reliable.

Nice girls, clean joint.

I had ping pong again - she only works on Tuesdays. I said to her, i'm sure i've had you before and you showed me some of you.
The she goes, - ok, but i'll have to charge you more. $30. and she undid her top. Her boobs were so big her dark nipples were protruding out the top of her bra. wow - that was so damn sexy.
and then she took her bra off and rubbed her nipples over my stomach.

She asked if i wanted more (stupid question) and then she gave me the most sensual massage ever. Massaging my thighs and i lay on my back, she went up and down ever so slightly stoking my dick. I just wanted to tell her to grab the damn thing.
she knew were all the erogenous zones were, rubbing and sliding and then she starting working on me. She let me play with her tits, but they were so huge and rock hard, i wasn't sure if i squeezed too much, they could burst. She finished me off, cleaned me up and said remember i only work on tuesdays.

i love this joint.

Back in ol' Sydney Town yet again with a couple of spare hours what else to do except get stuck into the RnTs! And who better to welcome me back than Anna from Photara!

Well gents, as per my previous post, Anna has left the building, or so I was informed when I showed up as usual with no booking. Gutted, but horny as fuck and knowing that there are a few other gems here I persisted. After a little discussion in Thai between the two on the front desk, a girl was fetched for me who could provide "very good service", with the slightest of giggles.

She shows me into one of the very well appointed (as usual) rooms and asks me to get ready, nakked isn't mentioned but I nude up any way. After a while, she returns and commences the massage. Her English is pretty good and we get chatting. He name is oi (and she spells it Aui) has been here for a couple of years, but only 1 month at Photara. From nth eastern Thailand. The massage is reasonable, but I'm judging her against Anna who was excellent, but not amazing. She does however turn the heat up slowly, giving my junk plenty of brushes while she's doing the massage. Eventually it descends into a straight tug fest and she then asks me to turn over.

Tug Time, It's good. Very good. About as much fun as you can have with her clothes on. She's not keen to take them off at all, seems to want to. I'm fingering her through her pants though and she's loving it. Most access I'm given is a single button undone on her top. The rules are strong with this one! But she does manage to get her tits mostly out. There is plenty of blowing on MiniMaid and the slightest of slight brushes of her lips, just the one time. It's enough to send me over the edge. MiniMaid shoots his load in a huge way, all up my chest. Much to Aui's delight. After a quick wipe with tissues she fetches a hot towel to clean up.
We still have about 30min on the clock so she starts the massage again. Clearly enthralled by the fact that MiniMaid appears quite alert it quickly turns into round 2. This time I take very little time to get over the line, while furiously fingering her through the shorts.

Damn, still 15min to go. She does the finishing parts of the massage (hands and arms). While trying to find a thai girlfriend for me. 20 questions, you like short or tall? You like slim or fat? You like big boobs or small? How old you like? You need good English? Eventually she comes out and asks if I'd like her as a GF. Time to GTFO. Which I do. By this time we've gone nearly 2hrs. Again, poor planning has left me with one $20 and a bunch of pineapples. I handover a pineapple for the extras and a tip and head for the exit!

So so rub, great tug, but I was lucky to leave with my wedding ring finger intact. 

I miss Anna

Essay : 
once again, any excuse to be back in Sydney.
Rock up, knowing that unfortunately Aui wont be here. But ask for her by name along with Anna, as they know the services I’m after.

Only have time for a 60min session.
Better massage, delievered by Mimi, whe works at a few other places and is from northern Thailand. Chatty, but we run out of things to talk about.

Not as good as some of the massages here, but ok. I think I’m in for another treat when she asks me about extras. I agree.

Turn over time and she positions herself down the other end of the table, kneeling between by legs, clearly a tug only on offer. Tug itself is good, but she’s very detached. I pop after a while and she cleans up. Minimaid is barely at attention afterwards, clearly not up for the second round. Massage resumes for the final 15min. again, it’s good but now great.

Overall, not my first pick from this place.

Value for money/recommend? : mmm No

My experience/comments : 
I rang both wynyard and lotus and all were booked up with punters getting their rocks off so came around the corner
to Photara. Only one girl there Niti and said OK to 30 plus HJ. She has a nice little Thai bod, not particularly busty
and an OK face. Stripped and onto the table.

She walked in turned the lights down and started the massage. She started by putting a towel on my back and using
her knees etc to go up my back - usual Thai massage - got my back cracking in the right spots, felt pretty good. After about 5 minutes
of this she remove the towel and put a bit of oil on my back to start the next phase of the massage. She asked if there
was any place in particular I wanted massaged and said lower back - been doing some gardening recently and wanted 
that part worked on. For the next 15 minutes an OK massage on my lower back and shoulders - have had better here. 
Then turnover time - no TT to get things going. She rubbed my legs for a bit and then put a little bit of oil on little C and
started the tug. My hands started to roam - butt OK, as my hands moved up to her tits she moved away. Asked the obvious
question and she said to touch outside $20 and $50 for topless - not nude. She did not turn me on that much and I declined
the offer. The tug continue with her working the boys and the main man - bit mechanical for me, no enthusiasm or any
real technique. After 5 minutes she said she was getting tired and said will you please cum - very polite. I said to her
to up the ante and she did and after another 5 I came. Clean up and back on the street.

Niti works Wednesday and Friday - I would try others as I think they are better

I miss Anne to

In town with super limited time. Figured I'd give this a go as the website says Saturday's now. I was suspicious but it turns out they are open!

One girl at the desk. Isn't much to write here. Had an outstanding 15minute massage followed by a pretty average quick tug. Simple and out the door. Bobby is good, if a little plain. There have been much better punts here. 

Tug was pretty mechanical. But she might losen up with regular visits.

Been ages since i went to to this place or any RT joint for that matter.

Popped in and was shown to my room by May. She is tiny but cute. Hard to tell any other dimensions as she stayed clothed the entire time.

This place for me is a special at a solid massage with a tug. The tug has never been mind blowing for me and has never been anything more than a clothed tug and this visit was no different.

Massage skills were sensational however and its always nice to get a solid massage in a clean environment with a happy ending.

on a side note on the way back to the office i noticed a new place that looked extremely R&T like at 197 Clarance St. Will hopefully get there soon for a review of that place.

Person's Name : Jane

Establishment : Green Masage 

Date of Visit : 18th August

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Level 3, 70 Pitt street - 9223 9378

Hours of Business :  10am to 6:30 pm

Rates : $35/30 mins, $60 1 hr

Age :  40ish ?

Size/shape : tidy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RNT

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : An unusual little place - it's in an office block - right adjacent to an IT (computer) premises - so when you walk into this joint you might pass some geeks on the way.

I've been there a couple of times now - only seen the one lady there, who is 40ish, professional type, she wore a white coat the first time! 

So - I wouldn't be asking for extras beyond the tug, for which a $20 contribution is well received. To make it clear, just put it on the table for her and she'll take the bull by the horns, so to speak. 

The massage itself is professional and worthwhile, with a few minutes of sensual action before the flip - and the tug not too bad. A bit like that little place in Francis street some years ago !

So - if you are hungover and in the vicinity and just want a decent massage and a HJ it might be your thing. And there's a dentist and doctor in the same building if you want to bundle your therapies...

My experience/comments : Went there for a 1 hour massage and got a nice medium chinese massage. Then onto to the flip at the hour mark and she said you not happy with massage - would you like to be ? Cool line I thought
Said how much $20 - asked about removal garments - no go there. she had quite a nice firm body for a MILF - so paid the cash. Anyway off to work on little C with the butterfly touches etc and a nice tug - tried touching her up and she called me a naughty boy and moved away. Only downside was not being able to touch.
Would go back just for the massage.

I did a swing past this place last friday and it looks as though they have shut up shop.

On a previouse visit the door was on the left of a small enterance that lead to another comapny. It looks as though they have opened the entire space up and Green massage is gone.

Doese anyone know if they offer the same service at Green massage in the mall in hunter connetcion?

Rates : $35/30 mins plus $20 hj

Age : 40ish ?

Size/shape : average

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 
Popped in here for the first time, following reading about it here, for a no complications massage. Was not certain that extras would be offered, but that would have been ok.

I assume I saw Jane - slim, not pretty and not young. Friendly. I should have asked for her name.

Massage was fine once her hands warmed up. I went for the leg rub on her which was allowed and obviously says extras are wanted. She continued with some tackle work and crack work. Playfully slapped my hand away a couple of times when I strayed too high.

Turnover and a quick negotiation for $20. Good hand action from her. She does have limits on touching her and stayed within those. Legs, bum ok, not much else. However it seemed to me that more would be available on return visits.

Nice head massage to fill out the time.

Went back to Green Massage, saw the same masseuse and it is Jane.

Legit massage to start until my hand on her leg gave her the green light to change styles. Good massage and tackle work while face down. Early turn over (about ten minutes) and we agreed on the $20 extra. She remains clothed and I think it will take a lot more than two visits to change that. Little hand slaps as I pushed the boundaries. Had to slow her hand down a lot with my eye on the clock that was not even close to 20min. Managed to reach into her top to have a grope and got a breast exposed, but no suckling allowed. She did the business. She exclaimed "you number one shoot". Maybe she says that to all the guys, or maybe it was because she had to get the tissues and clean my face and shoulders! It certainly was explosive - thanks Jane.
I would go back: $35 + $20 for great technique (though I was out of there within 25 min including dressing), and to see what progress I can make.

First visit to Green today.. Wandered around a bit before I found the place. Pretty much bottom of the stairs in the hunter st entrance.

Nobody else there, I was shown a room near the back.  I entered the room and she put the towels down for the hole in the table then left...   So I nudied up and laid on the table... If she asked about me being naked I was going to say that I was commando today....  (I hid my undies in my jacket pocket.)

Anyway, she came back, paused for a moment, then picked up the towel on the bed and covered my arse..   Pretty straight forward massage, no tackle tickle.....I even used my elbow to rub her between the legs but she moved away....  Was thinking it is only straight massage...

After a while she says turn over, so I just flipped with a full bar and looked at her then down at my cock...   She said, extra ?  I replied yes and she then said pay now please.....   I gave a sort of half cringe and then she said, later is fine... And she commenced a very very nice HJ.   I gave her arse a rub but she was pretty much wrapped up today so not really anymore action on her body...

I good technique and she gave me a good milking for a few mins after the event.   She then did a cleanup on me and gave me a head massage for the rest of the session.

I wasn't sure of the price when I walked out as we never discussed it, so was hoping I didn't get robbed...

When I came out, she was waiting a meter or so from the door and I gave her $50, to which she said $55. - yes, that's fine, I gave her an extra $5 and we parted amicably .

I had a good time and price was right, I will probably go back again.

Yes it was Jane i had and she works Thursdays and Mondays.

My experience/comments : Been awhile since I went there - been going to wishaway and 104, since I was around decided to
put my head in the door. Jane - actually it is Jean, was not available. So I had the other lady. I have Katie before
and she gives a great massage gets into shoulders etc. Bit of light tackle tickle and turn over time.
Unlike Jean she does allow touching or though has never removed her clothes for me. So touching of
boobs etc under the shirt through the bra is OK.

If want a good massage and pretty good HJ at a reasonable price this place is fine. Just don't expect
hot and sexy women to crawl all over you

My experience/comments : Finally got around to trying out this place. I had a few failed missions at the old location on Pitt St but have been avoiding the food court location due top the noisiness. Well it was bloody noisy but the massage was fantastic. Kate gave a fantastic chinese style massage that got all the knots out. there was little or no tackle tickle and no mention of any extras to the point she actually said all finished at which time i pointd to lil Oz and asked for extras. She panicked looking at the time but did not hesitate to get in there and perform a great HJ. 

WIR: yes but i would make sure i am upfront about what i am after next time.

Been about 6 months I visited this place, but I was in between meetings and I saw Jean was available at the front desk.
Rocked up and she said 30 or 60 - she remembered - only had time for 30. No worries.
Into the room and I get a cheeky pat on the arse. Stripped and onto to the bed, I didn't cover up with the towel, she giggled when she came in.
She knew I wanted extras. For the first 20 or so got a nice massage which is what you get here every time. Then the tackle tickle and a nice grope
of the old fella and turn over time. She said she was hot said take your kit off - offered $$ - no luck, so my hands started wondering as she played
with little C - tweaking her nipples etc - kept saying I was a naughty boy and gentlely pushing my hand away, it is a bit of a game. After awhile blew everywhere and she cleaned up and out the door.

WIth Jean YMMV I seem to be able to get further the more I see her

Age : mid 20's

Size/shape : cute

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Value for money/recommend? : mot sure

My experience/comments : Had been to this place a few times in the past as its a decent massage with relief. On my last visit i was prepared for the older asian ladies that usually run this joint and was going to be satisfied with a good massage and a tug by a MILF. Well it seems to have flipped total opposite. there were 2 young girls on duty af whom i was offered Joyce. Joyce is a cute young asian girl and was dressed in a short dress.

time for the massage and it was sub par compared to what the older ducks give but it was nice to be pulled off by a younger lass. there are no frills about this place and Joyce pulled back when i tried to run her bum and boobs.

WIR? maybe but its gone from a good massage joint with relief and is in danger of falling into the dime a dozen category.

Saw a younger girl here yesterday at the counter.  I had previously given up on this place but decided to give her a run...Her name is Sasa and she only started working there last Monday.  She says she only comes in when they call her.

Her English is really bad, but she does try to understand and sign language is pretty funny....

She showed me to the room and I asked if she does handy..  She didn't understand, but the universal sign language came thru and it was yes....

She comes back after a few mins and I am on the table...  She bends down and says, $20 for handy, and $30 for handy where I can touch her, then $50 for handy and her naked...

I opted for the $30 (on top of the $40 for a 30 min massage.  She ask me if I wanted handy first or last... I said last, and she then said that she will give 15 min massage and then leave 15 min for handy.

So she is moving around the table giving me a massage and leaning on me a bit, so I start caressing up and down her legs (as much as I can) while she is moving around.  I was hoping to get her horny so she gives a bit more...

Anyway, a really friendly girl, plenty of touching above clothes.... Smiles a lot.  Nice experience.  She used a bit more oil than I normally like but was happy for me to massage her pussy over her panties and slip my fingers down her bra to rub her nipples....  I'm not sure if and extra $20 is worth it for her to lose the clothes.....

Overall $70 for a 30 min handy with a bit of over clothes rubbing is the best around for a young girl these days.

Person's Name :    Katie

Establishment :     Green Massage Hunter Connection

Date of Visit :         01/10/14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :  Hunter connection

Hours of Business : 10am - ?

Rates :   $40 half hour + $40 tip

Age :   30s

Size/shape :  Medium, curvy figure, C cups

Nationality or Ethnicity :  Thai

Services Provided :   Massage + nude happy ending

Value for money/recommend? :  Ok

My experience/comments : 

For those that don't know this place it is down the stairs from the Hunter St entrance to Hunter connection. The reception desk is in an open area at the front of the shop so you can see who is on that day.  In the past walking by most of the ladies have been more mature and plain looking. Today I saw a younger lady sitting there so I thought I would try.

The girl sitting at reception (Katie) turns out to be Thai maybe early 30s and curvy figure. Katie shows me to the room and I choose the half hour option give her a $50 note. (half hour is $40 now, price has gone up). Now I should point out that I prefer chinese girls over Thai girls. Not that I dislike Thai ladies by any means, more that than I find Thai ladies exotic rather than beautiful. To my non discerning eye Katie isn't a stunner face wise but as I said nice figure.

After returning to the room (no change given initially) a medium strength massage starts and about half way through I get asked whether I would like any extras. Katie seemed keen to offer nude for $50, but at $90 all up that seems a bit expensive so I just ask for happy ending. $30 is then quoted ("$20 plus the $10 change I haven't given you" she says- this girl is a bit of  a player lol). So I point out $30 for happy ending is above the going rate and offer $20. She agrees then on a whim I change my mind and offer $40 for the nude option- done.

So Katie finishes up the back massage but oddly no tackle tickle. On turn over she 'strips' down to Bra and panties and starts the tug. Now I'm thinking wait a minute sister! So I say hey you said nude. She tries top off only at first claiming the period excuse and it might have been the 'thats bullshit' look on my face but the knickers were soon removed also. 

So after a slow start the happy ending was quite good. Boobs are probably bolt ons judging by the feel of them but look nice on her medium figure (not fat or skinny). A bit of verbal encouragement and I was over the line. Would I return? Not sure, I think for around this money in the cbd you can go to places like Bamboo massage or Snow Lotus which have even younger ladies. Still not too bad if you overlook the wheeling and dealing. Like a lot of Thai ladies I have met Katie was fairly laid back which made the process a bit easier. Cheers.

Value for money/recommend? : Yeah

My experience/comments : 

Popped into green massage last Wed to see Kate (She works wed and Fri).

I agree she is a bit keen on the extra  $$$$..  But I think she isn't sure how a lot of stuff works in the industry..

I would reccomend you give her the exact money you want to part with.    I have given her $90 and got no change and then $70  and recieved the same service.

I have been there about 5 times now and she recognises me and has never really argued or try to get extra out of me.

The plan I follow is:

1.	I give her $80
2.	At the turn over, I pull her top down/off.   No problems with that.
3.	After a few compliments on her great rack...   I squeeze her ass and rub her snatch over the top of her clothes.
4.	I slowly lean forward and with both hands pull down her pants and undies down to her knees and say "just on the outside"
5.	I continue the grope of her tits ass and snatch with a cheeky tickle near the end.

She seems to be fine with that and i think it is a reasonable price for her service.

Sometimes i think i could get more, but i like the WL to like me longer term... That way i may get something even better at a later date....

Person's Name : Aimee
Establishment : Green Masage 
Date of Visit :20 Feb, 2015
Hours of Business : 10am to 6:30 pm
Rates : $40/30 mins, $65 1 hr
Age : 40ish  early forties
Size/shape : tidy
Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese
Services Provided : RNT
Value for money/recommend? : no not really
My experience/comments : Its sits in the corner of this arcade, first time there, I very rarely go into the city and I had a little time on my hands in the morning, so I read some reviews and chose this place. 

Aimee was a pleasant lady, she was the only lady on that I could see, she was sitting at the front desk. When I left there was another lady who turned up and who was a lot younger, oh well.

So I go for the half hour, but this time I ask for the tug up front, I don't usually do that but a change is good as a holiday, well I won't do that again. Mate she gave me the quickest massage with no tackle tickle then got me to turn over and then went straight into the tug. The only thing that saved this was that the tug was very good, so I came and I went in a blink of an eye, lol. But I won't be back.

She wanted $30 dollars extra for the tug but I talked her down to $20. And I got to feel her tits on the outside I suppose better than nothing.

Rates : $30/40/50   30min/45/60

Age : mid 30's at a guess

Size/shape : medium build  , about a 12 , boobs about small Bs , hard to trell , left cloths on

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Great massage , ok RnT - so yes 

My experience/comments :This place just opened at the look of it.Still some minor works going on.It is up the stairs above the bottle shop. Will have to be good considering the competition all around there.
Setup more like an apartment , waiting area is basically the lounge room and the other punter walks past you, be it behind you.
Took 45 minutes and striped and have to say the massage was firm which is what I like. It was a proper massage. Conversation was light but she always had a smile on her face.
Was offered a B2B for 50 but just took the HJ for 20. I don't think she liked me trying to touch her too much so not sure what else could be available.Maybe it was just me.
Might have to go back agin and see who else works there.

Value for money/recommend? : Fuck yes!

My experience/comments :

I had just finished working for the day and decided I needed a good massage hopefully followed by some extras. I ended up in Seven Hills and decided to try my luck upstairs above the liquor shop.

The lady who answered the door showed me to a room and money was exchanged. $30 for 1/2 hour, thought I would try it out seeing it was the first time here. ML comes in the room she was wearing a sexy green skin tight dress, and she had the most amazing set of tits on her.  Have to say, she has one fine arse. Damn fine. Anyway I undress and lie down for the massage.

She asks me hard or soft, always prefer a good hard massage so 'hard'. Asks me if I want oil and proceeds to give me one of the best massages I have had in a long time! Even climbs on top and uses her knees on my back, tickling my balls with her feet in the process. The little fellow is responding to the foot tickling and I'm wondering what else is on the menu. She kneeds my buttocks for a while paying attention to my balls and arse crack. 

She leans over and whispers in my ear 'hand job' I ask her if FS is availabe and she says $60, I offer her $50 and she accepts. I roll over and the fun begins.

She peels of the dress literally and removes the matching bra and panty set. Dom on followed by 5 minutes of her sucking and worshipping my cock. She the straddles me reverse cowgirl with her feet under my thighs and proceeds to ride me. My turn for some exercise and we get into some doggy, nothing better with the view of her arse (did I mention that she has one fine arse?) grabbing her hips and going for broke. Played with arsehole a bit, but no chance of anal here.

Into the missionary position for the final run home and I'm banging away in her nice tight pussy. Time's nearly up so I blow my load and roll off her. She cleans me up with a hot towel and I'm truly satisfied. 

So I had a fantastic time!
Would really recommend you go there!

Apple told me she works Tuesdays and Sundays, I was just lucky to catch her on a Saturday.

Definitely will be going back there.

Hey BBFS70 Apple sounds great right up my alley but just to clarify did you see Apple at no. 1/115 or no. 6/115 as the main action is at No. 1 ( this thread ) I'm not sure if No. 6 ( down the walkway from No. 1 ) is providing the same quality of girls ?

Sorry James,

I miss filed this review, it was clearly labelled 6/115.  I was unaware of 6/115 and thought it was a error, thank you for clarifying this for me.

Cheers

Person's Name : Sasha (owner)

Establishment: 6/115 Best Rd Seven Hills

Date of Visit : 21/7

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6/115 Best Rd Seven Hills

Hours of Business : 10am till 7pm

Rates : $50 1 hour

Age : 40s milf

Size/shape : petite. Clothes on so cannot elaborate

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage only

Value for money/recommend? : Yes 

My experience/comments :

With all the good VFM places around Boomerang place closed and the 7 Hills Mall Massage place booked out, I decided to TOFTT and check out Number 6. 

Sasha was walking around near the parking lot when i arrived and we met on the stairs up. She asked if i was after a massage and in we went. There was another girl there as well (Yoko) who was busy.

50 for the hour and in a neat and nicely heated room we went. She proceeded with a very competent hard massage. We talked about the place and i mentioned that i had been there quite a few months ago and there was only one older lady there. She said she had taken over the place 6 months ago. 

Now, there was no TT or any play throughout the massage. she kept my groin covered at turnover as well. 

She mentioned that she is screening people who go there asking for RNTs and more and then telling them they are busy when they show up again. 

This looks like a straight massage place for now folks. The massage was well worth the $50 though and i will be back for that. 

The name now is 7 Hills Health and mobile is 0466 442 170.

Cheers

Thanks qgabs for the update, the address and the phone number.

If this places does not maintain its RNT status, we will move it to the pure massage thread.

Cheers

I would have to agree. Something definitely going on there. One closure and another place where you could get a R&T not providing it anymore would make me think the council have been around as well.

Person's Name: Ci-Ci

Establishment :6/115 Best Road Seven Hills

Date of Visit:19/7/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink:

Hours of Business: 

Rates: $50 Hour 

Age: Forties

Size/shape: Size 10, short

Nationality or Ethnicity: chinese

Services Provided:Massage

Value for money/recommend?: not really

So after trying to go to Unit 1, and finding it all shut up, i thought, "well now i get to check out Unit 6 without being intercepted on the way". Saw two guys leaving with big smiles. Ci-Ci shows me into the room, wearing very tight fitting dress, with plenty of leg showing and titties form quite visible. I was however, disappointed that she was older. Generally, i dont like having fun with someone i could envisage as an aunt. Wanting to spend enough time to miss the traffic in the area, i checked in for an hour.

Ambience here absolutely sucks. She was constantly talking to the other ML in the next room in Chinese, and loud at that. When not talking, she would be watching to TV in the room... which was equally as loud as her talking. When it was a suspenseful moment in the movie... she'd even pause the massage. i wasnt impressed, and obviously not the least bit interested in any part two.

However, i would say that part two may be available. She was not shy to get up onto the table and straddle my head (while i was facing down). She wasnt shy to sit on my naked ass (i could feel her warmer areas). She wasnt shy to straddle my legs (again, could feel her warm areas). When she would be standing next to me, she'd place herself within reach, so i could try feel her up if i was inclined (which i wasnt). On turnover, she did all the motions to get me aroused, but i closed the eyes and pretended to be somewhere else - it would have been obvious i didnt want anything else. She may be someone else's cup of tea.... not for me though.

Im not confident on the cleanliness of the place either - I saw her just reposition the tissue i used for the hole in the table for my face. grossed me out. And the towel she used to cover up here and there during parts of the massage - was re-used after me also. 

Not returning.

Max

I went in here the other day and had a chat with the owner Sasha. I actually stopped to go to a convenient store that used to be in the shop (according to the sign) but as I walked up realised it was a massage shop. Sasha was a very nice lady and showed me around. She said she would be working on her own until business picks up. Didn't get a massage so I can't comment on the quality of service.

Comments:
I saw a Cracker ad for a new shop on opened in St Marys. Detoured off the M4 after a quick call confirmed availability and TOFTT. Rocked in and mama san introduced me to an older 40-45 yo MLC girl who took the toll. Room was clean, with cheap little LED mood lights stung about with gyp rock walls going about 3/4 way to the ceiling, with a lockable door. 

My ML calling herself Kaishe spoke very limited English, so it was easy to concentrate on the decent FBM she gave. 15 minutes left to go and the TT started, followed by her hand signaed negotiations, including the pricing by fingers (20 for handy and 50 for nude). No FS available. Her age and appearance couldn't entice me for the nude offering (no value there IMHO), especially when FS just down the road at the same price)- and I really mostly wanted a back rub anyway. 

An acceptable handy followed while I played with her butt cheeks and moist panty patch. She made attempts at lots of sexy, orgasmic faces, with some low, sexy breathing noises, but was clearly concerned about noise traveling over the wall. I doubted others would mistake the sound of an extended handy for the sound from the light therapy "slapping" common at TCM shops. An acceptable ending for a standard toll, but nothing special. A little bit of clean up with nappy wipes followed (no warm wet towels offered). The ad lists a shower is available, but it wasn't offered to me. A few goodbyes and I was out the door. Won't be back.

Could find any reviews to suggest if this was a legit or negotiable place, so headed in to find out.

From the outset, was asked to leave underwear on, so i didn't have high hopes.

Shown to curtained off area from reception, and a very pretty young thai thing came to do the massage.... long loose pants and shirt. Not looking good for fun.

She tucked enough towel into my briefs to create about a 3" buffer from any sort of touch, which never even went near the sensitive parts.

Nevertheless, good massage, but certainly not the best I've had.

Massage only. Nothing extra offered, nothing extra asked for, nothing extra suggested.

 Remedial Massage Seven Hills Mall
				
Post Content: 
Rolled into Seven Hills during a visit to Sydney recently and had an hour to kill so decided to TOFTT at this joint which is towards the furthest entry / exit point of the Seven Hills mall. 

They have a heap of options for massages. The $55 for a full body massage option looked good so asked for that and was led into a curtained only cubicle and was joined by a manly looking ML who said take off clothes but leave undies on. While undressing i brushed against the ML in the cubicle next to mine so needless to say, privacy is not afforded here.

Massage began and the manly woman (her name was Ching i think) hit me with a very firm massage which completely straightened out the kinks in my back shoulder and neck.

Very workmanlike and very above board. A good experience. 

Once done, the mamasan asked if i had health insurance and gave me a reciept.

Not a bad experience. I headed off to the golden triangle of massage shops near the station for extras (stay tuned).

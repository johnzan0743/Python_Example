A new Thai massage place has opened up in Crows Nest. It's called "Style Thai Beauty & Massage". I don't know if this place offers RnT but I thought I'd let you guys know in case someone wants to TOFTT.  I will probably do that at some stage and report back.  It's brand new and only been open a week or so.

TOFTT 

Didn't call ahead, just walked past the shop with the intention to check it out. Decided it looked nice and went in to have a closer look.

Greeted by two ladies. One behind the desk and another playing with her phone in one of the comfy chairs used for foot 
reflexology. She got up straight away and ushered me into one of the small cubicles. Typical setup with curtains and walls that are open up the top. 

Thai-Nee (pronounced 'Tiny') comes in and asked me to take my clothes off and lay down and disappears again. She is very pretty, but dressed in traditional Thai clothes, so I fear this might be a legit place as those clothes look hard to take off. 

She comes back in and I ask if it's ok to take everything off? Tells me that's up to me and so I do and lay down naked, thinking to myself: "Who knows... maybe?"

Everything about this place looks legit, so I didn't get my hopes up, but one never knows. I much prefer to be naked on the massage table, rather than having my shorts cut into my legs when it's time for stretching etc so all good so far and the girl didn't seem embarrassed.

A really good massage started. I opted for the 30 minute oil massage and she really used her time good. But alas, no hint of anything more than regular massage. She did do a great job of my butt though and wasn't afraid to venture there, however nothing else. Nada-zip-nothing...

Then a hot towel and turn over. I still had a grain of hope left, but nothing again. Sorry to say.

All-in-all a great massage and I can highly recommend this place for just that, but I guess this thread can now safely be moved into the Pure Massage Only section of the Forum.

Had a couple of great massages at this place, fixed my back, (and my front).   
Nothing extra-curricular though, maybe with another visit or two and familiarity some extra stress relief could happen.  Can always hope.
Worth it for great massage and relaxing experience regardless.  Get them to walk on your back. They know their job, Great..

Went to a joint like this once in Malaysia, where they make you wear these paper pants, asked for groin massage as I had been riding a bike and as she rubbed I unloaded in those little paper panties which I now know are not sperm proof. She didn't touch anything and was disgusted with me but hey, who cares?

No paper pants,  just judicious placement of the towel as they work around your parts. 

Heh I'm sure they have some nylon massage shorts you can wear,
 if that is what floats your boat, w**k's your crank,  what ever.  ha ha

 Style Thai, 6/7-100 Clarke St, Crows Nest
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Nan

Establishment : Style Thai

Date of Visit : 8/11/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6/7-100 Clarke St, Crows Nest

Hours of Business : 10am - 7pm

Rates : $50 / 45 minute oil massage (promoted as a 'special' at the time of my visit)

Age : Late 20s

Size/shape : Average height for a Thai girl, nice build, a bit curvey

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage only, no happy ending 

Value for money/recommend? : Okay value for a massage, not good value if you want anything else

My experience/comments : I wanted to try this place out in the interests of 'Taking One For The Team' as my first post on AXXXReviews. I hoped for a happy ending to the story, but no, this shop is 100% legit, at least from my experience. So if you want a happy ending then spend your money somewhere else.

I hoped the flashing "Special $50 oil massage" sign out the front of this little shop might have been a hint that something more than just a massage is on offer. A few Thai girls working there, Nan was sitting there and assigned to me by the receptionist. The 'rooms' are cubicles with a curtain to separate them from the hallway, the first indication that this would probably be 'above board'.

Nan told me to take everything off but leave my underpants on, but I opted to strip right down as a sing of what I was hoping might happen. She didn't bat an eyelid when putting the large sheet over me, lifting it up as I rolled over etc. Sometimes her hands moved close to the 'fun zone' but no closer than was necessary or even unavoidable. It was obvious I was up for more, as I was 'up', and could have tried to move her hands closer to see what happened but didn't get any sign this was on the agenda.

So I settled for a decent 45 minute massage which in the end was all I got. I suggest AXXXReview members look for their rub-and-tug elsewhere.

Dropped into this place earlier today as my labours this week have left me feeling a bit sore and niggly.

$40 for 30 mins of traditional Thai massage was the option I took and my masseuse's name was Lek. The operation doesn't have even so much of a whiff of "hidden extras available". The shop is basically a room with four curtained cubicles and a kitchenette.

Of with my clothes and on with those pants that look like casual pants for the morbidly obese. Because (I'm assuming here) I was the only customer there, was polite and made a half-arsed attempt to speak Thai, I got more than 30 minutes of good massage. The MLs here are not WLs in drag. 

I was massaged everywhere except the places important to those looking for indications of tug availability. I always love the contortio... stretching towards the end where you get to hear your spine, ribs and neck crack and pop as they've manipulated into moving in directions they've never experienced before (or have experienced very infrequently).

I may return if I'm in need of a proper massage as it's quite close to work. However, at $49 for a full hour's massage under similar environmental circumstances, the Newtown Thai Massage Centre is far better value.

s.o.o.

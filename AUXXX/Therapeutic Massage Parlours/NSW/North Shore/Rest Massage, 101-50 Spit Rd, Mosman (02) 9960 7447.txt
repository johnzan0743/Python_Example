This shop could be worth checking out. Didn't see a thread on it from a quick scan of this group, but I do know that it's roster includes Kiko formerly of Willoughby Rd, who works here on Wednesdays under the name of Mia. It's open 10am to 10pm, pricing for "full body oil massage" is a decent $40/45mins, $55/50mins and $65/60mins, and from what I've heard of the rooms (size, space, privacy) there's plenty of scope for girls to offer as many extras as they want.

It used to be called Thai Mesmerise I think.. I used to go here before it changed hands when it was a quality massage with HE..  I went a few times after it changed hands a year or so ago and was not impressed with the quality or price, I think it was $80 an hour then..

I think it's probably worth another try if it's changed its name for a 30 min quicky..

They used to have a rear entrance off the lane and easy access from the free parking under Aldi..

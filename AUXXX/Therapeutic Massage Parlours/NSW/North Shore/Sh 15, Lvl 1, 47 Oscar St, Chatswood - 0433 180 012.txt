Suite 15 has one main room with a shower, walls to the roof and a door that shuts plus a sink unit and room 2 is a broom closet (it's tiny) is touching allowed, don't know but give it time....it's pretty much staffed by younger girls who would rather play with their mobile phones, you can not beat an older MILF, they need the money, put it this way newbie, I would not go back

I was invited there by an older ML I was seeing at another venue, it was $50 for cbj and massage.

Recently the older woman has moved on and been replaced by pretty young things that only do HJ when pressured into it.  Definately not my cup of tea!!!

Down stairs directly off the street appears to be being renovated and may offer larger broom closets.

Still no shortage of options in that complex, i wonder if this place is linked to 29a as the logo seems to be the same.

Cheers

Hours of Business :  

Rates : $55/hour $30/HJ

Age : Early mid 20's

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage/HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Not really, depends what you're into

I was in Chatswood on this wet Sunday arvo so thought I'd do a reccie.
Had a walk around Neridah St/ Oscar St and found this place right off the street on Oscar St side. Walked in and very presentable Jessica showed me to the small cubicle 1 of 2, with walls 2/3 way to the ceiling.
jessica was a nice looking chinese girl and the massage was passable, fell a sleep until the backslapping started! She asked if I wanted a HJ near the end of the hour and I thought why not, She certainly needs some coaching in this department, very remote and lack of finesse. Got over the line whilst fingering her Y thru 3 pairs of nylons and trying to imagine her in the raw. Think it will take someone far superior and with more patience than me to improve this place.

It used to be - when Jenny ran 29A, she set up this upstairs shop at #15 as a 'VIP' room complete with shower and bar stocked with free booze (and where some AXR folk enjoyed some memorable sessions!) - but when she sold 29AS she kept 15 for a while, then sold that as well, don't think it was to the same people as 29A though, so maybe the similar signage is just a relic.

Hours of Business :

Age : Early mid 20's

Value for money/recommend? : So So

I had gone here to see ViVi who I had met there before. Vivi took me to the room took the $, and then left. Got myself ready for a nice session with ViVi. Then Alice turns up to do the massage - she's is quite plain. Has a nerdy glasses look. Her massage skills are nothing special, and unfortunately she was a bit timid when it came to the happy ending part of the routine. 

The shop itself, I was in a downstairs room, is very cramped and not too appealing.

Better punts to be found in Chatswood.

Onto my fourth post

Background - been punting on and off for years, and need to widen my knowledge of the scene.

The Quest - Get a BBBJ / CIM and / or FS as a value-for-money extra at a cheap Chinese massage shop (probably a bit demanding, but lets see how we go).

Chapter 1 was 107 / 379 Victoria Avenue Chatswood

Chapter 2 was Level 4 / 822 George St, Sydney

Chapter 3 was Level 2, 518 Kent St, Sydney

Chapter 4 is 15 Oscar Street, Chatswood

Person's Name : Jessica

Date of Visit : Friday afternoon, Feb 2012

Hours of Business : Until 7.30pm - 8.00pm

Rates : $55/hour $20/HJ

Age : Early mid 20's

Size/shape : Pretty slim, but with a very well presented rack / cleavage

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage / HJ

Went in, tried to fob me off with a very milf midget who had definitely seen better days. Then mid-20's girl busy texting stood up and volunteered to keep me there. She was pretty, nice tight red dress, good figure and great cleavage. Took this option.  

She was fine with my preference with soft massage, and this went on for a while, but she wasn't real co-ordinated, didn't seem too into it, and wasn't really good at building up the tease aspect. Started trying to touch her beautifully smooth legs with a view to wandering up her skirt, and was pretty sharply rebuked "No Pay No Touch". Aggressive. Defensive. Not friendly. This took the heat out of it, so I just let it go until time for business came.....Same as Chapter 2 & 3, $20 HJ, $30 clothes off, but definitely no BJ, let alone BBBJ...........even though she had a hot body, I opted out of the full nude, as I couldn't see any real good touching or licking or body rubs......Took the HJ and finished off, even though I would have loved to come all over these tits........

Conclusion To Chapter 4 - Quest not attained. Still the quest continues. While I'd love to fuck her, I would not go back to this girl or this shop, largely based on attitude. 

Post Mortem: Since this punt, I've finally got my Bronze Membership and access to these reviews.......hopefully now THE QUEST will start generating some real results, given I can now do some research on all Other BM's experiences...I'm sure I'll find something out there.....until then THE QUEST remains an Epic Fail !! Looking forward to reading all your other threads..............

Try 533 Willoughby Road in Willoughby. Five minutes from Chatswood, Gorgeous all-Asian ladies, clean establishment, full service a given, great madam (Angie) who posts rosters on this website, clean establishment, the ladies are encouraged to offer bonuses like BBBJ & CIM without additional charge, and the rates are less than some massage/HJ-only joints. I like to go for an hour-long Rub'n'Tug then if I'm in the mood (duh) I ask the lady to hop on. Awesome!

After checking the roster phone 02 9967 9991 to book in advance; it works better for them and for you. Open 10am till midnight.

And if you go, post reviews!

Hi Ghandi, thx for the feedback, much appreciated, although I've been to 533 many times, and totally agree that it's one of the best places, if not the best, around. Angie's great, and the girls are usually very high quality, with lots of xtra service for no xtra $.

While 533 is a licenced FS joint, just to clarify, my QUEST is to get BBBJ / CIM / COF / FS at a cheap Chinese massage shop - agree I might have to pay up to what I would at 533 anyway, but for me there's a bit of added thrill in seeing how far the massage girls will go.........or not.

Cheers,

PR

PS: Been overseas for the last 6 weeks, including 2 weeks in Pattaya getting my brains fucked out for nothing by stunning Thai chicks. Now back to reality, it's time to get back to teh QUEST and start posting my reviews again soon.......

On arrival this girl stood up and offered to see me.  She looked nice and was well dressed.  Said she was a business student (what else?)

She was fine with my preference with soft massage and had a cheeky smile and manner in the room.  Nicole was happy to be touched above the waist and to being suckled.  Not at all defensive or unfriendly.   Definitely no BJ or CBJ

Value for money 7/10  would be happy to see her again but in ho hurry.

Visited here 11/10 for 45 mins / $45 , waste of time & money.

Forget the young Chinese lady's name, was a size 6 & reasonable looks but no interest in the R&T.

Her English was ok, but many 1 word answers to questions.

Asked for firm back massage but was fairly soft with not tackle tickle..it was straight to the turnover & tried to get me excited while watching the clock & chatting to girls in other rooms.

Better value with Thais in Artarmon or Lindfield or Chinese @ 302 Pacific H'way . 

Won't be back.

Judging by the lack of posts on this thread, I'd say everyone's taken the hint ... but let me be yet another and say it again - this place isn't great for the RnT. >.< Killing time between appointments last week, thought I'd drop in. I visited 29a last time, so thought I'd just try this place out - bad idea, should have checked the forums first! 

Anyway, opted for an hour with 'Vivian'. Paid up front, went back outside, and up the stairs to the other room. In her defense, Vivian was unbelievable hot. Blond, blue-eyes, tanned, EPIC looking body and German. Spoke with a bit of an accent that had me pinching myself ... even more so when she told me to get nude, so I could 'relax'.   

Unfortunately the massage was mostly shite, and she talked quite alot. I didn't mind really, I enjoyed the chat and she was interesting enough (turns out she's traveling around Aus, going to be in Sydney working Sun-Wed for a month), but it was hardly "Chatswood’s newest  hottest adult massage parlour" ... as is according to the website. Anyway, shite massage + chatting katy's unbelievably epic cleavage = me incredibly frisky and absolutely no relief ... 

Anyway, it might be just this girl (YYMV after all), but just a headsup. SO many other places in Chatswood. 

This is there website now also -- Chatswood Massage - Sydney Babe Massage

Hi Guys,

Just my 2 cents worth regarding Chinese massage parlours vs the Thai R&T joints.
I find that the Chinese massage parlours are expensive and the girls usaully try to upsell (especially in Chatswood).

i.e. Basic price for 1 hour is $60 then $50 for nude HJ and then sometime more for body slide. This is not always guaranteed. Normally the Thai joints charge $60 1/2 hour and $110 for the hour and includes nude HJ with body slide. They are also more trained in it.

I am sure some people with disagree with this comment.

Nope, none I'm afraid. Sadly by the time I was finished there, just about every other place in town had closed. I ended up tucking my tail between my legs and going home boneless. :P

I didn't think this place closed THAT late... Still a few places in Chatswood open past 8pm, I believe, but maybe your best bet would ave been to make tracks to Willoughby Road for FS.

 Healthy Massage - Sh 19, Victoria Plaza, 369 Victoria Ave, Chatswood - 02 9904 6157
				
Post Content: 
I'm assuming this is the place referred to in this thread.

This is where it all began for me, many years ago  they've been here for over 10 years now, when Chatswood had only a couple of Chinese massage shops. In fact, this place was quite likely the original. A fully legit massage business, it used to be owned by 2 Chinese milfs, Lisa & Helen  prob still is. They both used to do a very good massage  then more recently sat at the reception and barked instructions at the fully-trained staff. I stopped going quite a while back when I found more "interesting" venues   I also got sick of the constant background chatter and the sound of the washing machine. The walls here don't go to the ceiling so it can be noisy not my ideal situation.

Having said all that  I was offered my first massage-tug here, yonks ago, and had a few pleasant sessions before moving on. Even now, I'd be surprised if anything other than a simple happy ending happened here clothes firmly on unless they've decided to compete with all the rnt joints within 60 seconds walk.

This place was also the start for Linda Lee, who now owns the (also fully legit) business at 3/341 Victoria Ave. Both places great for serious remedial massage. I'd return to either if my needs were absolutely, exclusively therapeutic... which probably means they won't see the professor again...

Ah, so that's where Linda at 3/341 got her start. Agreed, she is excellent at 'real' massage although she is also known to add a tug to the rub at no extra charge if you're a regular,

Too true HQ... I've experienced Linda's accomplished added manipulations. Best I ever struck at 3/341 though was Rain (that was her name)... now if she were to turn to the dark side, I'd be tempted to commit abduction...
Don't know if she's still around.

Linda keeps a pretty tight rein on her crew there - strictly professional for the most part.

Linda's service is like that of Natalie at Tiandi. A really good massage with a really good 'happy ending' but no touching, no extras of any sort. Some of the other girls there do extras for extra money. Others don't do any extra at all.

No, it's not the upstairs-on-the-corner one.

Victoria Plaza is sort of an arcade, between the Archer St cnr and Chatswood Chase. If you know the Easy Way place on Victoria St, next to a few Chinese restaurants with BBQ'd ducks in the window, Victoria Plaza is directly across the road from that.

Establishment and/or person's Name: Wendy
Prices: I think it's $60 for the hour
Age: Late 20s or early 30s
Size/shape: Trim, cute girl-next-door
Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese
Services: Massage with happy ending, and no extra charge for the tug
Value for money/recommend?: Good value and worth a visit, although there's no shortage of alternative locations within five minutes' walk.

This tiny little massage shop is snuck away in the far corner upstairs at Victoria Plaza, which is a small walk-in mall at 369 Victoria Street  down from the intersection of Archer Street, almost across the road from the Easy Way bubble tea place. Downstairs of Victoria Plaza is an Asian grocery mart; upstairs overlooking the street is a restaurant, and this massage place is down the other end of that upstairs floor. By memory there's a sign reading '99' or '99 Massage' over the door - it also goes by the full name of ' Healthy Acupuncture Massage Centre'.

My visit to this place followed dinner at a nearby Chinese restaurant which followed a late client meeting in Chatswood, so I was all dressed up in the suit and tie - and that, along with that I was a first-time visitor to this place, seemed to indicate to the young and cute Wendy that maybe I was expecting only a legit massage.

So it wasn't until the end of her very good regular massage that I had to suggest a little 'extra'. Wendy didn't disappoint, and while there was no boobplay or similar touching on the cards she rounded out the session very nicely. That this happy ending was included in the cost of the one-hour booking was a bonus.

Establishment and/or person's Name: Linda
Price: $45 for 45 minutes, $60 for one hour, tug $20 extra
Age: Late 30s, not exactly a MILF but appealing enough
Size/shape: Slim
Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese
Services: Average massage with happy ending
Value for money/recommend?: It's getting hard to recommend any place that isn't a knock-out, what with the competition around Chatswood. The massage was average, the tug good, but that's pretty much par for the course these days. Worth a visit if you're in the area and want perhaps a quick 45 minute (or even 30 minute?) relaxer.

Linda works at this place seven days a week (!) and unlike many massage ladies she's got decent enough English for a little chit-chat. She's no outright MILF in my book but she's easy on the eye and appealing enough.

The massage consisted more of long stroking along bones and muscles rather than any actual pressure or kneading, so it was relaxing without a doubt but that's about it - it's not among the more fully therapeutic rubs I've enjoyed, but good enough for a wind-down if you've had a busy day and also to wind you up into the tug session, which Linda does nicely.

Just so she knew I was after something a little more than the massage, when she was at the head of the table and my hands resting over the edge I used them to give her legs and thighs a little gentle stroking... so when she moved down towards my backside and upper legs she spent a fair bit of time there, gradually moving into the pre-tug teasing, then when I turned over she oiled her hands up and rubbed my chest and stomach a little before slowly working down onto Mr FlyBoy and his two stony sidekicks, at which point she asked if I wanted "special massage, cost extra"... well, that's an easy question with an easy answer!

The tug was good, with some nice sackplay and gentle crackwork but no rimming, although only a little touching (on my part) allowed, mainly around the arse and up her top around her back, but no boobplay.

A hot wet towel to clean up, the last ten minutes spent on a head massage, handed over $20 for her extra trouble and that was that.

My experience/comments: Have been to Healthy Massage many times and 9 out of 10 times just get a normal massage but every so often you get a bit of a touch up and an offer of a happy ending. $20 seems to be the acceptable tip. Other weekend went in and was getting good massage when the sack got a slight touch, when it happenned a second time I opened legs wide and gave a little moan. Soon I was in full moan as she went to work on the cack and shaft. Then suddenly she stopped and said there was only 5 minuted left and I would have to buy more time. I offered the customery $20 but she said I would have to buy 15 minutes. I gave her $30 and she didn't seem happy but did the job. Very strange. Haven't been back since but I guess curiosity will get the better of me soon. Will report.

I used to be very regular here but have stayed away since finding many more "interesting" establishments nearby. I would guess they have lost business to the ever-burgeoning supply of massage possibilities in Chatswood so no doubt, up-selling is a device to hold clients. The value here was always just very good legitimate massage - any happy ending was mostly a reluctant afterthought.

I'd be interested to hear if things have changed but I'd doubt it. For genuinely stimulating extras, I suggest going elsewhere. And for Chatswood, as AXR demonstrates, it's not a long walk...

I have to agree, the market is very competitive these days. We've seen some places opening up with a much better fitout than the norm - eg Tiandi, 29A Neridah and perhaps also North Star at 43 Neridah  plus some places that really raise the bar to a whole new level (Oriana at 7 Help St is foremost for that). Offering the same 'tired' standard rub'n'tug, perhaps with no extras at all, isn't a formula for success any more, especially as people discover sites like AXR and get savvy as to their many options.

I think the same would be affecting those two shops on Katherine St, as well - they offer some extras beyond the tug (mainly strip and sometimes tit'n'clit play) but with Natalie around the corner doing great massage+tug for $50/hr, the margin narrows.

This then swings possibly in favour of some of the cheap-but-cheerful places like the one above the hairdressers on the cnr of Victoria and Archer, but 'cheap' has got to be foremost and value (not trying to squeeze you for extra time or above the card rates for extras) is second.

Yes, the place has become a massage smorgasbord. Would be nice tho, to see more places offering shower facilities. Completing the shopping with a layer of oil on board is not ideal...

Of course, Oriana is the massage gem in every respect.

Curiosity got the better of me and I went back Saturday. Took hint from others and put cash on table before massage. Unfortunately only had 50s so put down $100. Got allocated Wendy and asked for 1 hour. Really good massage and every time she finished a part she ran her hands down around my arse. By the time she got to my legs she was extending these explorations to full tackle tickle, a bit of crack teasing and strocking the old fella. I nearly came twice before she got me to turn over and finished me off with a superb HJ which included a lot of tackle massage.
She then cleaned me up with hot towels and gave a great head and hair massage. Didn't record the exact time but she went well past the hour and didn't seem in any hurry to finish.
When we had finished she pointed to the cash and asked if that was for her. I said yes and she didn't bother bringing any change but I didn't care because although $60 + $20 is the standard here for a 1 hour R&T, this one was worth every dollar.
Wendy works Tuesday to Saturday.

A while ago, I ventured in to this establishment for the first time and was allocated Linda, who I see has been reviewed here a few times.

Linda, I think, would best be described as a pocket-rocket.  She is very petite but, as has so often been my experience with such massage ladies, is extremely strong.  Although I'm a bit over six-foot and 85 kg, and I guess Linda would be at most 45 kg wringing wet, I doubt whether I could beat her in an arm-wrestle!

As I prepared for the massage, Linda politely enquired as to which part of my body required attention.  Despite the deliciously open-ended nature of her question, I played a straight bat and told of her several marathon sessions I had recently had on the computer (doing real work by the way, not reviewing the seemingly endless reviews on this site!).

I had booked 45 minutes ($45) and Linda then proceeded to work my back, neck and shoulders in a very competent fashion, gradually releasing many of the stresses and knots there.  Although I had requested "medium", she provided an extremely firm massage, with her hands, forearms and elbows all used to good effect, prompting the occasional wincing from me ("no pain no gain" I kept reminding myself) and I think I would need to go into training before requesting a firm massage from Linda.  

Anyway, when I wasn't wincing, the massage itself was very relaxing and I appreciated the soft music and soft lighting (I still can't believe how many massage places have not yet realised that bright fluoro lighting is anything but relaxing for the typical punter).

During the course of the massage, I enjoyed a very pleasant conversation with Linda, and she was happy for me to practice my very rusty Mandarin picked up whilst working in Asia for many years.  Her English was extremely good, although, as usual, she was very humble about her language skills.  Linda told me that she works seven days a week - I never ceased to be impressed by the discipline and  dedication of several Chinese masseuses that I know in providing for their families.  

Interestingly, oil was used rather sparingly during the massage, possibly because of the strong remedial nature of the massage to my back and shoulders.  Upon turn over, oil was used on my chest and neck and, as I was feeling well and truly relaxed by this point, and as I was enjoying our conversation, I was happy to accept Linda's suggestion to extend by 15 minutes (making it the usual $60 for the full hour). 

During the massage, there was no indication of any extra services and also no suggestion on my part.  I was very satisfied with a thorough remedial massage although I see from other posts that such extras may be on the menu, perhaps for repeat customers, and I am sure that such experiences would be delightful in Linda's hands. 

A word of warning, for those who may feel the need to have a comfort stop during a massage, perhaps understandable given all that pressure applied to the lower back and stomach, and especially if you've had a coffee or two beforehand, I would suggest you plan ahead as there are no facilities within the shop and you need to make a dash outside to the nearest restroom.  Even more of a problem when you make that dash only to find that the toilets are locked and you need to return to get a key!

Hey s6, If it's still the same as the old days then, yes 'wish to extend' is code for happy ending or more massage! See my post 1 in this thread.

With all the other possibilities in Chatswood, you will get as good a massage as here + a happy ending (and more if you want!) for the same money.

Don't think even asking will help anymore. They have stopped closing the sliding doors and now have curtains in the doorways. Also signs in rooms ask patrons to keep underpants on. Looks like a deliberate move away from the R&T image. I guess this is part of the fall out from the fuss in Help St. This place was always at best a 50/50 for the R&T anyway so not much lost. Still worth it for the massage but pity about the other.

Nope signs don't work......just take the undies off I do. Ask for a HJ, I have never been refused here before but maybe I have just got lucky. Went last week and had the tiny pocket rocket and got a very nice HJ, just make sure you make it clear what you want before the time is up.

Hope you are right Sparksy but I did get a knock back this week from a girl (forget name) who had previously been happy to offer a HJ. This time she still did a fair sack tease but then went for the hot towels. I asked for a HJ and she just said sorry and carried on with a head massage. Maybe I just struck a bad day.

Went there last week. I kept my undie on during massage but later the lady took my undie off in the middle to my massage although I noted that there is a sign saying: "keep underwear on". There was plenty of sack tease but I did not ask for extra as I was new there. perhaps will try next time and I am wondering if anyone has been there recently and extra been offered.

There are at least 2 girls here who do massage plus HJ. Their names are Wendy and Mery. It is best to ring and book because Wendy is very popular. Also I think that when you book them they know what you want. Mery has glasses and is average looking but quite good technique. Wendy is attractive, give a great massage and her HJ is spectacular. I rate her as better than Natalie and that's a high rating. Unfortunately, Wendy is so popular she expects a good tip and $40 seems to be the going rate which means a 1 hour massage plus HJ will set you back $100. As far as I know there are no extras beyond the HJ.
Don't worry about the underwear sign and if you get the choice take a room at the back as they are a bit more private.

Wendy is very popular and you need to book ahead. Some years back I had a massage from Linda which included a HJ but more recently I have had girls tell me Linda doesn't allow any more than a massage.

My experience/comments: 

Have been to Healthy Massage many times, usually seeing the very popular Wendy. Walked in, greeted by small, petite and rather pretty – seemed Thai/Indian - receptionist. Wendy popped her head around, said she was busy. How long, has consecutive bookings. Wendy said with a wink, petite receptionist would look after me.  Unsure, but agreed to go ahead.

Into the room, I noted that there is a sign saying: "keep underwear on" and asked if undies stayed on. She indicated off, and closed the curtain tightly. All good signs.  Onto the table, soft please. She seemed shy at first, started on shoulders so I indicated that was not the area needing addressing. A delightful TT started with considerable undercarriage work, that soon got Richard rigid. She pulled him back, applied more oil and began a very slow tug. Ah…………..bliss!!! 
Did a great job, no touching as I was on my stomach until an explosive finish – just as I like it. Hot towel wash-up and a peck goodbye. Great value for money.
PS  Sorry did not get her name.

Following from my previous post above (in which I meant to say "a definitely unattractive woman", not "in attractrive"!) I took another chance on this place the other week.

40s MLC lady behind the counter was okay in looks but with a nice somewhat exposed rack which FlyBoy figured was ripe to be set free, but after handing over my $60 for one hour I was handed off to another lady named Lily, of average/normal MLC body and lesser looks. I'd rate her as MILFA3D, which is "MILF After 3 Drinks" - as I doubt I'd be that way inclined sober or after just two drinks.

The sign in the room says "Keep underwear on", but of course we experienced members of Team RubTug know better!

Lily did quite a good massage for the first 40 minutes – really worked the lower back and legs, all like a pro – only the barest hint of any 'extras' via a soft could-be-accidental touch of the sack and crack as she worked the upper leg.

A warm wet towel wipe-down and it's time for 'Turn over please', and even proper towel draping would not have disguised FlyBoy Jnr's state. Fortunately Lily didn't go in for proper towel draping, leaving FBJ handily exposed for the handjob which soon followed, although she did ask first if I wanted that, and said it'd cost $20. Done deal.

Unfortunately, Lily wasn't very enthusiastic about the happy ending. Mostly one-handed technique, a bit too fast, eyes not really looking anywhere, expression showing no interest... well, okay, they don't have to be madly interested in the job at hand, but it helps, and when it comes to the ladies who do this best - especially my favourite classics like Selena, Natalie and Jenny – there is no doubt that they are getting into the job, which makes it all the better for us blokes and all the more likely we will return to them again.

And that's why I won't be returning to Lily. 8/10 for the rub but 4/10 for the tug.

Person's Name : Mary

Establishment : Good Health Acupuncture Massage Centre, Chatswood

Date of Visit : December 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 19, Victoria Plaza, 369 Victoria Avenue, Chatswood - 02 9904 6157

Hours of Business : 9.30am to 7.30pm

Rates : $60 for 60 minutes

Age : Late 30s?

Size/shape : Average

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage & happy ending; health fund rebate

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, good but not spectacular.

My experience/comments : Dropped into this shop in Chatswood recently. It's upstairs in 'Victoria Plaza' which is a U-shaped group of shops in the same block as Chatswood Chase, but down towards the other end of the street closer to Archer. Chinese grocery market is visible from the street and down a flight of stairs, assorted shops on the ground floor, up on the first floor towards the very back left side is this shop.

Cute young nicely rounded girl on the front desk, was hoping she would take care of me as she's got that semi-innocent 'girl next door' look so I booked an hour at $60. Instead I was handed off to Mary, late 30s or maybe early 40s, okay on the eye but no head-turner, but wears glasses which I like.

Sign on the wall says "Keep underwear on, no sexual services" or whatever. Ignored it of course. Off with the togs, face down, Mary gets into a decent massage, no doubt if I wanted' hard' she could give it but was a good 'medium' massage.  She asked if this was my first time, I told her "No" because I reckon first-timers don't always get the extras.

Covered the backside with a towel but she pushed it down to work on the bum during massaging my back, and then pushed it up to work on the inner thighs during the leg massage.

Got the "please turn over" quite a bit earlier than expected, maybe halfway through the massage. Mary draped the towel over my boy bits but her massage on the upper leg went right up to the inner thigh and cupped the sack, run along the rod, she knew what she was doing alright. I reached down and pulled the towel back, she motioned for 'handjob?', I smiled and agreed, she whispered "Pay extra", I replied "$20" - she was very keen to keep the noise level down, by the way.

Mary got to work on a decent handjob while I stroked her back, then her front and to her top, then down the front of her scooped-out top and eased out her A-sized (but very round) boob and nice little nipple, gave it some attention with my fingers and thumb, then she leans down and I put my mouth to it which really started to get her excited, but she's again worried about making noise!

Shot my load, she went out and came back with the warm wet towels for cleanup on back and front, then she continued the leg massage and then spent the last 10 minutes on my feet.

Good value all up, Mary works every day except Wednesday, there are probably worse ways in Chatswood to spend $80.

Very true! And there are definitely some better ways... 

Great review for a long term "old favourite" venue... Thanks Jack!

Establishment : Good Health Acupuncture Massage Centre, Chatswood

Date of Visit : 3rd Jan 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 19, Victoria Plaza, 369 Victoria Avenue, Chatswood - 02 9904 6157

Hours of Business : 9.30am to 7.30pm

Rates : $60 for 60 minutes

Age : Late 30s I guess

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, for a great massage.

Had a 60 minute massage from a ML called Julie (although she spelt in July on the shop business card).  She asked me if I wanted normal or oil.  Wary of being drenched in oil, I said just a little oil.  She proceeded to give a great quality massage through the towel with elbows and fingers digging in to all the right spots.  There were no hints of extras or any additional teasing whatsoever.  I don't know whether it's because I'm new to the game and wasn't exuding the right vibe, if I need to be forward with her or if it simply varies from lady to lady.

The massage itself was brilliant though, I'm definitely going back for that alone and if it's only a legit massage from her I'll still be happy.  She works Fridays to Mondays

While this review will barely qualify for listing anywhere other than "strictly therapeutic only" I have had 'alternative' relief here in the past... albeit somewhere around 7+ years ago. But you may well ask why bother now. For the last couple of weeks I've been trying to get rid of low back pain that keeps giving me the shits.

Visit #1 was a purely legit attempt to get some relief. Lisa's shop is well known for sports massage and other treatment for specific injury and pain and the hope for a bit of monkey spanking was purely incidental. Indeed, I did get an excellent massage... so good that I extended for another 30 minutes. By the end of that - which culminated with the leg out, inner thigh treatment - I had a huge boner that kept urging the towel to slide off. Julie duly ignored it without comment or even acknowledgement... yet even a blind deaf mute would've been aware . But as I paid Julie at the end, I did detect a wry smile and the vaguest hint of irony in the suggestion to book her as she wrote her name on the shop card.

Thus, visit #2 yesterday for further back treatment with further vague expectation of a hand relief finale. The overall outcome was similar. At the hour, I've been done both sides and there was the typical legitimate wrap-up. However Julie then reminded me that last time I had extended. The expectant fool in me assumed this was a subtle indication that pleasure waited in another 30 minutes... I acquiesced.

At around 10 minutes of extended play, my leg is out to the side and she's working on upper inner thigh... there's no towel and my dick is trying to reach the smoke detector on the ceiling... we smile at each other... I reach up and take her hand and place it fair on 'Da Man'. Julie recoils... FMD, you'd think my dick was a striking pit viper... 

So progresses the remaining minutes of play. It is like some sort of cat-n-mouse game... in which my engorged member reaches bursting point and the plums get bluer by the second. She motions for me to take to myself... I respond by pointing at her, then at my tackle... she replays the sequence. She keeps putting a finger to her lips indicating concern from outside... well yes, there are others here and we're protected by a mere curtain...

Julie relents only a degree which serves merely to exacerbate my frustration... she intermittently slides a hand up the length of my shaft while thoroughly stroking all around my groin. So she will actually touch it... she just won't tug it . I even attempt to give her some targeted stroking... my approach is gently repelled. She repeatedly encourages me to take myself in hand... in desperation, I finally begin a slow wank... but she keeps this finger-to-lip concern that I'll make some noise. Faaaarrrkk... I finally give up. No way this will ever work. John Thomas dies in disappointment......

She finally concludes with a hot towel cleanup, I pay and leave... barely able to walk through the sheer frustration of another 90 minutes of fruitless lust for release.

Maybe staff fear Council snoops... maybe Julie is simply a straight-lace. This shop is busy... indeed a biggest complaint would be there's always chatter going on just outside... maybe Lisa pops her head into the rooms at times. Fuck knows. I doubt there will be the test of 3 times lucky... at least for another 7 years.

Great massage... otherwise, a fail.

Yep, this shop is very much hit-and-miss depending on the lady. A decent choice if you want a decent massage and are prepared to forego the certainly of a tug to follow the rub, but if you do want the happy ending into the deal, there are better bets in Chatswood.

The trick of course is getting a lady who does a proper massage while also being keen to finish you off the right way. A lot of the time they can vary even within one shop, so the same place might have one woman who's great at massage but another who's rubbish at it.

As a rule, I find Linda's shop further down Victoria Avenue (Vital Massage at 3/341 Victoria Ave, the red brick block of flats next to Chatswood Chase car park) is probably the most reliable for a rub-and-tug which both rate well.

The more 'sensual' a shop's services, the more rubbish the massage tends to be, in my book. Of course there are plenty of exceptions, but again those tend to revolve around a certain lady.

Hard, if your back needs fixing and your tackle needs tickling I would steer you towards Cici at Mount Street, North Sydney. She'll give as good a massage as you want and happily ups the ante to a very sexy bodyslide before sealing the deal.

Agree with all that Flyboy. My attendance at #19 was as much an experiment as anything!

I must add that the back has improved but yes, Linda's ladies at Vital mostly seem to have a broader skill base. And it is certainly true that generally, Chatswood offers significantly greater pleasures almost anywhere one cares to look... just don't tell the press!

We hear you Sparksy... we hear you!!! But not on this thread... remember?

There is always an issue requesting someone never met...esp in a shop like this where the question, "Why (cold) book me?" may be very difficult to explain. Much easier in other places... not easy in a legitimate massage shop such as Lisa's.

Just me? Maybe. Or just maybe, here is not the place for this discussion. Mods?

In Chatswood again last week, winding down the client work there so less likely to be tempted by sheer proximity in weeks to come. Well, not just proximity but that you walk around here and the streets and shopping malls are stacked with so many Asian lovelies, and Flyboy doesn't always have the strongest willpower!

Decided to have a bit more of a 'punt' this time, rather than go for the tried and tested, and potentially TOFTT, so I wandered into 19/369. It's been YEARS since I have been here, maybe years since any of us have been here judging by the last post being September 2014, almost five years ago to the day!

Now a bit of back-story, 19/369 has gone through some changes over the many years. It was a semi-regular haunt of mine back when Chatswood was just starting to gain those 'massage' shops, and run by some wonderful MILFs, and also had the benefit of some good staff who later went to open their own shops, eg Linda Lee who later opened Vital Massage down the road next to Chatswood Chase, and I think also Jenny from Penshurst St?

Anyway, I had some pretty good sessions here, then other places opened and competition won out, especially in the quality of not just massage but shop fitout. 19/369 still has small cubicles with curtains instead of doors and walls that don't go all the way to the top, so you can hear other punters, and the washing machine down the back churning away, plus chatter back and forth between the ladies and the manager. It's not a very relaxing environment! That and also 19/369 became a bit more 'hit and miss'.

So I decided it was time to try this out and see what's changed and if anything is for the better.

Nothing has changed in the shop itself. The woman at the front desk is definitely MILFy and has 'that look' in her eye, but I was assigned 'Linda', 40something, average looks. Why are almost all Chinese massage women named Jenny or Linda or Wendy?

As I walked into the shop an older  Asian woman customer walked out, not sure if she left her underwear on or not LOL  But also during my session I heard two other Aussie guys come in (one sent away as the shop was too busy) and one Chinese guy who stayed for maybe 30 minutes and seemed like a regular.

Anyway,  I opted for 45 minutes of 'Swedish oil massage' for $50, and ignored the sign on the wall which said to 'leave underwear on'. Linda's massage was decent but not good enough to have me extend, although she certainly gave the arse cheeks and inner thighs plenty of attention during the upper leg massage, making it very clear that extras were on offer just by her actions. While I was still on my stomach she did that thing where each leg is angled out with the foot of one leg against the calf of the other, so it's a bit like drawing a '4', this is a good tactic which lets the lady work more of the leg, around the side and front, while also increasing exposure of one's undercarriage so the lady can take advantage of that, and Linda did.

As we got towards the end of the first 30 minutes Linda definitely amped up the undercarriage action, it had previously been strokes around the area and that almost accidental brushing of the side of the sack, now she oiled up her hand and slowly worked her way down and around the crack, up the front to Flyboy Jnr, and with each long stroke back along the cheeks and crack there was more attention to the datehole. Now the towel was still on at this point but not covering me fully, it was at various stages through the massage being nudged aside to provide Linda with the necessary degree of access.

Time to turn over and I want tentpoling the towel, so Linda pulled the towel aside and oiled up her hands and began the tug, doing quite a decent job of it. One thing you can largely rely upon is that 'older' woman generally know their way around a cock! I let my hands wander, Linda asked me if I wanted her to take off the top for $50, but I declined, she wasn't that hot or stacked or even MILFy, although she didn't object when I continued to gently rub around her breasts over her top, her nipples started to poke through the material and it was clear she wasn't wearing a bra. I must have been doing something right as she stepped back a little, lifted her finger to her mouth for a cheeky "Shhh!" and then lifted up the top and leant down so I could like and suckle her nipples, something she obviously enjoyed. Her handjob continued with some probing of the date, and before long I was across the line.

Based on this experience 19/369 is back in more reliable 'hit' territory, and I am definitely tempted to swing back on my next visit to Chatswood and ask the front desk mamasan if I can book her and to make this the last booking of the evening, just to see what fun we can have

Wow Flyboy, that sure brings back memories! Thanks!!

I vaguely recall my first RnT here an absolute eternity ago... years before I started keeping 'records' of the naughty adventures of Master Hard! 

I guess it's a matter of TOFTT but I stopped going here all those years ago because it became very hit or miss... mostly miss. But since all the Chris Seage inspired drama has long since faded into history, perhaps #19 is indeed back on the 'circuit'.

The choices around Chatswood seem endless 

Now as I browse back reminiscing through this thread, I'm wondering if this was the same "Linda" who featured all those years ago? If so, she's sure handled more cocks than most!!!

The same Linda? I wouldn't know, and it's a common name, but if she is the same Linda then she'd have been stacking away a lot of 'tips' over the years or even decades!

I'm trying to think back to my first Chatswood rub and tug. My first rub and tug was actually in Parramatta, and that's a whole 'nother story, for Chatswood I think I actually started at Help St back in its glory days as a superb Asian 'health spa' haven which did the spa and scrub and then you'd go into a room for the massage followed by body slide or FS. I think I gave some early custom to 'Massage 19' as I think it was called then, as well as Linda's own shop down the road, but as soon as I discovered the manyfold delights of Natalie's Tiandi shop, she became my go-to for Chatswood 'massage'.

Indeed! Who could forget the Help St Oriana Korean spa and that delicious Kara. I doubt I've had a better body slide, DATY and BBBJ since 

That was 2010. OMG how time flies 

About time they let the blokes back in there, now called Arisoo Day Spa (ladies only)

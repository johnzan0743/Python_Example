Person's Name: Alice


Establishment: Saint Leona Massage @ St Leonards


Contact Details/Address:  Shop 2/6-8 Pacific Highway, St Leonards NSW 2065 Phone: 0450766338 


Date of Visit : 12th Feb 2016


Hours of Business: 10:30am - 6pm


Prices: $40 - 30 mins 


Age: 40's


Size/shape: Tall, Size 10, C cups


Nationality or Ethnicity:  MLC 


Services: RnT 


Value for money/recommend?: Yes 


Needed to be at the Royal North Shore Hospital to hand in my 24-hour BP machine as I walked back to the station I noticed the shop across the road from St Leonards Railway Station so across the road to take a second look from the outside it looks very legitimate. So I thought I would just go in and asked the pricing and perhaps go ahead with the massage because I could certainly have done with one after my restless nights sleep with the BP machine going off every 30 minutes.


I entered the shop and as I thought a very legitimate set up including the chart of healthcare providers that offered rebates. Then as I'm standing there the cheerful Alice rolls out from behind the wall that hides the hallway and I recognised her immediately from the time she worked in Chatswood at North Star. All thoughts of legitimacy when out the window as I was guided through to one of the treatment rooms at the back of the premises. The setup of these rooms was very professional and I have no doubt the majority of their customers are there for legitimate treatments. But I know Alice and I know this was going to be an exception.


For those who have not met Alice before she is a very nice person and a good masseur, she also has a lovely firm set of C cups that are rarely bridled by lingerie. Alice provided a very relaxing 25 minute massage and commentary on what she's been up to and where she's been working over the last few years for inviting me to turn over and start the inevitable climax of our session.


Like always access to Alice's puppies is never an issue and her nipples are always responsive. One of the things I really enjoy about this girl uses always smiling while she is tugging you, she looks and behaves as she is if she's really enjoying her work! Access was available in the lower areas and as per usual was very quick to be moist, if not soaking. That did it for me and it was all over.


Nice clean up, peck on the cheek, $20 tip and off I go. Everyone is happy.


Now I know where she is I'm going to have to visit again before she moves. Alice works here Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Understand she is in Archer Street on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Interesting,

I found this add in locanto http://sydney.locanto.com.au/ID_9390...tion-Best.html which is for a provider working out of 1/44 Hampton Artarmon.

And she is using this telephone number.

Any thoughts guys?

Chalk: as it happens, I called that number last week to check if Alice/Lisa was working, expecting it to be the number of St Leona, but got the impression from the lady who answered that it's her number (ie, the lady who answered) and that she worked at both Artarmon & St Leonards, rather than it being the number of the shop itself.

I'm becoming a regular at 44 Hampden. There is no shop phone but there were two different mobile numbers advertised (BP and NST), neither being the above number. Trying to ring those mobiles to book was a waste of time so I gained the private number of my favoured girl. This girl rather derisively said that the woman at the other end of those phones "has too many shops".

I haven't seen "Bella" in the locanto ad but the spa pics could well be at 1/44. At some stage maybe I'll sort out the mix of girls/phone numbers and post on the 1/44 thread. I realize this is the Saint Leona thread but clearly, there's some linkage, if only Bella's itinerary. 

Seems direct booking to your favourite ML is the norm in many places these days, such is my collection of numbers... I sincerely hope I don't lose my phone!!!

Mods, I am guilty of thread hijack.

FB & Hard,

OK, it seems that the at least this slice of the industry, at least advertising in Locanto are now operating as independent operators, with their own phone numbers and leasing the venue.

1/44 has heaps of ads doing this on Locanto.

The phone number is the girls, not the shops.


Mods, I suspect the number is associated with a girl in St Leona, not with the individual shop.

Oh and FB, I think we need a review of St L's.  there is not much in that thread, and I have often looked, but not touched lol.

Saint Leona

Shop 2 / 6-8 pacific Highway St Leonards. (Opposite side to Station  Close to Traffic Lights)

$40 & $70  30 / 60 mins.

3 massage bays - walls do NOT go to the ceiling. Tables are good quality and the place is clean.
No shower  the toilet is separate upstairs.

I visited this shop a number of times between October and December 2015 and May / June this year due to severe back spasms. I needed a professionally competent massage without "diversion" and this was the place I chose, it is close to where I live and was clean.  As my back improved my treatment was able to broaden in focus and so did the ministrations.

Brief summary of Massage ladies.  Personal Experience.

Mamasan  Anna  China

Young Milf 35  40? 155  160cm, size 8-10 Attractive lass with good firm body.
English is limited but has a great attitude and smile to go with it.

Qualified  - Super massage ability this girl, she is the masseuse I visited during my back only treatment and it was all I was interested in at that stage  believe me.
Others may have had more extensive massage from her.

Bella - China

Milf  45 -50?  155cm  mature build, not fat, good boobs.
English is good, personality is great.

Experienced masseuse who can deliver a good strong massage. Will "flip the top" for, "usual score" is fairly rudimentary at that skill, others may find it better executed than me. Overall a good experience because of attitude and desire to please.
Bella works here 3 days a week, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday?
She also works at another shop on Wednesday as mentioned above.

Dong Dong  China.

Milf 50?  160cm  size 8 (I can't guess these) in good shape.
English is not that good !  good attitude  good service.

Dong Dong  does a good strong massage if that is what you want  she can "ring the bell" as can be expected from someone acclaImed with a name such as Dong Dong or Ding Dong.  She did a basic "toll" for me, she was happy, so was I, not a lot to report on this aspect or I would. 
Monday and Wednesday I think and maybe Sunday. (days have changed)

Alice  China

I first saw Alice back in Neridah St, then another shop In St Leonards, Archer St, she is still great.
I have seen Alice a couple of times here, she is reported above, there is not much to add other than to say she also has a great service attitude with good communication.  Probably the best "allrounder" here, certainly in that aspect of massage that I am mostly devoted to.
Thursday and Friday I think -- ??

Rose  China

Milf 45 -50  160cm  8-10? Slim with a sexy air.

I have not availed myself of her massage yet and she is "on hols" at the moment, usually works Tuesday. I will be interested to try her skill at some stage.
Also works in Campsie she told me during a truncated chat.


There are no young masseuse here they are all Milfs as reported.  In fact in the early days there was a mixture of male and female masseuse. This basic summary may be of some help to members as I saw some commentary about this shop and its phone number , I spend quite a bit of time motorhoming these days so my life in Sydney "around the traps" is now limited.

Person's Name: Anna (Mamasan)

Establishment: Saint Leona Massage

Contact Details/Address: Shop 2/6-8 Pacific Highway, St Leonards. It's almost next to the railway line (same side as the F45 gym, so it's the other side of the road from the station) and across from the pedestrian crossing from Herbert Street, so very easy to get to if you're on the train or coming into St Leonards by bus, although parking around the area is a b*tch.



Date of Visit : July

Prices: $90 - 90 mins + $20 happy ending

Age: Looks 40's

Size/shape: Average height for MLC, a little extra padding, B cups

Value for money/recommend?: Yes 

Enough's been written here about this shop, what you need to know is that it's clean, with a decent fitout and can be as legit as Anna the Mamasan allows or as the clients require. During my visit I heard one block and two ladies come in so clearly a mixed clientele with suitable varied expectations.

The rooms are more like 'cubicles' though, not in size as they're decent enough dimensions (but could be wider) but with walls not going up to the ceiling, so less privacy and during any post-massage playtime the lady will likely advise you against being too vocal in your appreciation of her ministrations.

Anna's reputation for a really good massage is well-deserved, so much so that I upped my initial 60 minutes to a 90 minute session, as much to get maximum enjoyment from a proper therapeutic massage as to ensure the happy ending wasn't rushed.

She's very friendly and 'professional' without being cold, and finished off the massage with a very good handjob, during which she eased her boobs out so I could show my fullest appreciation of them, something she enjoyed too as she summoned forth a rather large load of my swim team.

Oh, one other thing, during my visit the music playing was basically an extended long-play version of Neil Diamond's Love On The Rocks. How 'extended long-play', you ask? The whole frigging 90 minutes! Seriously, I don't mind Neil Diamond but I can do without 90 minutes of this!

Back when I was a regular with my favourite northside ladies Natalie and Selena, when they'd just opened their respective shops, I cut each of them an MP3 CD of mixed 'music to massage by' just to they had some variety in their 'playlist to play by'. Think I need to do the same for Anna and co!

Haha muso Flyboy, yes you do as I have been spending a bit of time there lately. The back door comes in handy with an office close by. Anna AKA Leona does a very very nice massage that gets better as she knows you more.She owns the place but will try and tell you she is just the manager. Doing very nicely to according to the other girls and has a nice balance of female/male customer apparently around 40/60.

Hey guys,

I was there last Tuesday to see Bella who had been advertising on Locanto with a different picture, I was pretty under whelmed.

The massage was only OK, nothing mystical.

She upsold me from 30min to 45 min, charged me $30 for a touchy HJ, and in the end, both she and the venue was dirty.

When I did touch up her boobs, there was oil from the previous putners hands in the cleavage.

When she finished the massage, she simply straightened out the towel I was lying on and refolded the towel that was covering me.  Yuck!!!

Nope I was underwhelmed.

Yes Chalk ... as I said in my summary of Bella her HJ was "rudimentary" as is Dong Dong, not in my list of competent or high rankers of manual manipulations. such as Yuki and Jessica, Chloe, etc - all of different shops. Bella and Dong Dong were TOFTS and will remain so. I am sure when I first went there when the shop first opened it had disposable covers ?? ..WHICH I THINK WE SHOULD promote to all shops ??

My HJ was a $20 - I've heard $30 ..Price structure ?? but the lines are becoming quite blurred here and Bella gave me some "stupid" price options ... Anna .. a developing story. 
Alice was best HJ here but is now gone as was going to buy own shop .. but it fell through I believe .... we should lobby Anna to bring Alice  back !!

Yes Bella works here sometimes and more days now at Saint Leona now that Alice has left  The Artarmon shop is owned by a lady called Lily, whose number I got "somehow" when I called she was in China on holiday (since returned). she has about 5 or 6 shops. Bella mainly advertised on Locanto for work in Artarmon, but has changed that more to Saint Leona because she is there more often now !!!
Apparently they all have their own numbers for booking ... not sure how it works ... rent a room by girls?, but Lily just gives you the number of a girl(s) to contactat the list of shops she will give you.
Last time I went to 1/44 - I walked, but there was another likely lass (MILF) there, who was booked, but who gave me a most "complicit" look ... but I lost her number.

Apologies, I don't want to hijack this saint Leona thread, maybe it should go to a 1/44 thread ?

Swung through here a few weeks back, sorry this report will be lacking in detail due to fuzzy memory and a basically 'unmemorable' punt.

The lovely lithe Alice has indeed gone but apparently may be coming back for 1-2 days a week. I hope so!

In the meantime, I got a semi-MILF who is there six days a week; short, 30s-40s, average build, short -cropped hair. Good massage, quite a practiced tug with boobs out for the finish. Paid at the end with $100 all up.

A bit busy during my visit, some customers being accommodated and others asked to wait or come back; noticed all the customers were male, how about that!

Still looking for a comfy cosy Asian shop with that reliably magic combo: a great massage, a great finish and the option for more. I know that St Lena can deliver a triple-play here, depending on the lady, but right now that seems more 'miss' than 'hit'.

Yes Searay,

I too have learnt to avoid the Bella, I posted in another thread last week that I walked on her.

I also find her unclean and constantly on the upsell.

Her age is not an issue for me, and she certainly does have a large rack, but the constant upsell just ruined it for me.

My experience/comments : 

Just catching up on recent punts as I've been busy

I've been looking for a professional message place for a while that offers extras..  I've tried a load and it's either been a good massage and no happy ending or a bad-to OK massage and alright HE  I've been spotting shops and trying to find some reviews on them..  I've seen this place a few times when stopped at the Junction, it looks a bit dodgy from the outside, after some extensive googling I found 1 single review of the place on another site from years ago that indicated that extras might be on offer..  I hadn't slept well and needed some relaxation, I figured if I can get the top knocked off as well it would make my day

Called up the shop and confirmed they had someone available  Also checked and they have no shower so had one before I left..  Got to the place and there is free parking outside after 12:30pm on Saturday and all day Sunday  Entered and was greeted by Lei, she showed me to the table and I asked to use the bathroom..  The bathroom is out the back and up a couple of flights of stairs, she took me all the way and she had a bit of a MILF air about her, I could see she had a massive pair of titties and was well dressed and manicured..  I eventually found my own way back to the place (a bit of a rabbit warren from the bathroom).

There seems to be 3 beds, sectioned off with walls that don't go right to the ceiling and curtains at the end (Legit looking massage place type environment).  The place was clean and presentable.  I stripped off and lay down on the table  She came in, covered me with a towel then the usual hard, medium, soft question out of the way and the massage started  Very good massage and she knew what she was doing  She just massaged away on my back for about 20 mins, then moved to my legs  She moved the towel around me just exposing the bits she was working on  She moved onto my legs and worked up and down, she worked the inside of my thighs and caught the old fella a few times, on one occasion her finger went straight down the middle and over the head, she made a point of saying sorry but it was obviously on purpose and she'd got me hard as..  

30 mins in she removed the towel completely wiped me down with a hot towel and asked me to turn over, this was a bit more forward than the cover with a towel to massage  I turned over and she grabbed 2 tissues and wrapped them around my hard cock (Never had that before), she then massaged my abdomen with 1 hand around my balls with the other This continued for a few minutes and she signalled HJ for $20 or take top off for $50  I opted for the HJ and put my hand around her waist, she grabbed my hand and put it on her tits saying "you like it better up here", then she continued a nice slow HJ while I played with her titties

It didn't take long and I was shooting everywhere  She cleaned me up and started one of the best head massages ever, I fell asleep for a good 25 mins and only woke with my own snore..

She then gave me another wipe down with a hot towel and left me to get dressed..

She was waiting for me at the desk, I paid for the massage and her tip..  Checked her name, grabbed some sweets and I was on my way with a smile  I'm going to give her another go this weekend and may release those big titties and see if she will put my cock between them..

A narrow escape from Bella last week, thanks for the warning chaps!

Once again seeking a decent massage with a tug at the end, I was in the area and figured that after quite some absence I'd try St Leona.

First things first, though – figured I'd call ahead to see who was on. Dialled the number listed atop this thread and was told "Pinky and Emma". Okay, sounds decent enough... any massage girl named "Pinky" has got to be a bit less serious and more playful, I reason!

Heading into St Leona, two ladies unoccupied – one behind the reception desk at the right, the other on the ouch. The one on the couch springs up like a jackrabbit, takes me to the room at the back. She's got a less-than-average face and her manner doesn't do much for me either, despite the large rack. I think to myself "Okay, this one is no 'Pinky' and somehow doesn't seem like an Emma", so in the room before she asks how long I'd like to stay, I friendly-like ask her name. She replies "Bella". Alarm bells ring and I backtrack - "Oh, of course, I saw you a few weeks ago    Is the other lady available?"

Bella is a smidge crestfallen but calls to the other lady who comes in, and she's more like it – she's not a Pinky or en Emma either, but 'Anna', who works here each day and who I've seen before. I opt for a 60 minute stay, which is $70. I try to explain about calling ahead and Pinky and Emma, she suggests I may have called their other shop up the road which is a Thai massage place..?

The rub: very good, although I get Anna to go medium-soft (I'm such a wuss) because I want a bit more relaxing than therapeutic, but if you want harder I'm sure she can oblige. A mere hint of tickle tackle around the rear, 'accidental' brushing of the sack. When I turn over she covers FB Jnr with a few tissues, WTF? The towel is just off to the side, covering the leg she's not working on. FB Jnr continues to push the tissues up and away, which makes her laugh, in the end she just takes them off thank God.

The tug: Having completed the massage, Anna offers the happy ending and it's a foregone conclusion I'll accept. She works it well, and is appreciative of my wandering hands, doffs the top to show a pair of nicely rounded C-cups. She's good on the eye contact and smile as she milks away and brings you to the bring and the thar-she-blows moment, then cleans up. washed her hands and completes the session with more shoulder and head massage. The toll was $120, $70 for the hour and $50 for her extra ministrations, a bit more than I'd usually pay.

Would I return? Well, with Anna I know what I'm going to get, but I'm not sure how much more is on offer, it may very much be a YMMV situation.

FB, I know how you feel, I had over exerted this aged body of mine on the weekend and needed a good rub before I exerted over another younger body than mine .

I tried 6/21 Willoughby road, while they are no longer known for the most attractive ladies, Mamasan opens early say about 9:00am and is known to give a very good rub, which she did, and "lisa" arrived just in time to finish with a nude tug for $40, (with the advent of the newer parlours in the area, I am wondering if the $40 for nude tug from a lesser endowed older Asian woman, (but not fugly) is a sign of the local commercial pressures).

Anyway, a good rub and a relaxed tug works for me.

Cheers Chalk

Swung by earlier this week, was in the mood for the rub+tug but not in the mood for Anne or Bella so I rang beforehand and managed to discern from the English so broken that a team of Bunnings handymen couldn't fix it, that a lass named Lulu was on. Okay, I'm game, and game enough to book a solid hour at $70, should have stuck to 45 minutes.

Lulu is late 30s, easy enough on the eye. Nicely rounded up top and bottom but sadly also rounded a bit in between, so there was no compulsion for me to have her nude up for the tug. English almost non-existant. Massage okay but a little too much emphasis on firm stroking rather than a really good therapeutic massage, which is one of the things I'm always seeking and mostly in vain in the years since Natalie and Mina and co (long-time readers and punters on the lower northside will know of whom I speak). Did a weird thing where she used tissues to wipe down the oil and then followed with the warm wet towel.

A hint of tackle tickle partway through the massage, and it was almost like a tickle, not really my thing.

The request to 'please turn over' followed by request for $30 for the tug. Her tug technique also involved this weird tickle-style approach, was hard to communicate to her that I didn't fancy this, it did the job but in a bit of a 'fizzer' of a way because I'd never had that sort of treatment as the 'tug' so there was stimulation but not the type of orgasm I'm used to. Finished with head massage (the other head). Can't really recommend Lulu.

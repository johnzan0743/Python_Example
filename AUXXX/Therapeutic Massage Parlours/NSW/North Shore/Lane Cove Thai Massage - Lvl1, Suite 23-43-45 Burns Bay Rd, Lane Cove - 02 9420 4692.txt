My experience/comments : 

Was in the area doing some grocery shopping and walked by the place.. My bro HHboy had been painful in his constant reminders of TOFTT!  when meeting up for espresso whenever we walked past for our weekly chow wow..

So I took one for the team and him! And reminded him afterwards he needed to do the same! next time we walk past a massage shop neither of us has been to before! You hear me BRO!

So the review is not much to add or erotic in the sense.. a very legit and good for me anyway massage done by a cute thai girl with strong technique and smoothed out the other kinks not done so from the other day at 518 Kent street, CBD.. 

An ok oasis and time and I actually fell asleep towards the end and had to be woken up.. was really tired I guess..

Will be back for some more therapy and relaxation and calm..

AB, Thanks for the intel and TOFTT. I can cross this off my "to do" list 

There's one in Mosman I need to try called Siam Orchid Thai Massage in Spit Rd. When I get to it, I'm hoping it's more to our liking...  It just has 'that' look about it from the outside...

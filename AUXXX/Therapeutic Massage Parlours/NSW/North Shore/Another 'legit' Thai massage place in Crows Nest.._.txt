 Another 'legit' Thai massage place in Crows Nest..?
				
Post Content: 
Walking through Crows Nest yesterday, I noticed a vacant shop on the corner of Clarke Street and Clarke Lane (just off Willoughby Road, down from that CocoCubano cafe on the corner) with a DA posted in the window to become another Thai massage place. Hours are to 8pm but this still could make it legit, as the place on the corner of Willoughby & Albany has similar hours and is 100% legit.

It's a sorry state of affairs... add that place on the corner, a shop just further alone Clarke Street, the one on Alexander Street, and I think one on the highway as well, and Crows Nest now seems to have almost as many legit places as rub'n'tugs. Very unfair on the punter who heads in looking for a bit of 'total relief' and gets shafted when it comes to a massage for his own shaft.

PS and FWIW: I think somebody here asked about the 'steam sauna spa' massage place on the Pacific Highway, near the intersection of Alexander St? This is a legit-looking place and it does legit services but is attached (both legally and by dint of a stairway) to the place upstairs and around the corner at 8 Alexander. When you walk into the Steam Sauna Spa place the mamasan will ask what type of massage you want and give you a few options such as Thai and oil massage, and if she judges you a likely candidate or if you confidently answer 'oil' she adds the option for a young lady from 'upstairs' for full body massage, although said young lady can also come downstairs, but I think that's more for a rub'n'tug not a full bodyslide treatment.

Is that the old photo shop? There's also a DA posted for another bar/club upstairs at the same premises - wonder if related?

I have heard rumours that Anna's massage just down the road from VIP and Serenity that was always 100% legit in my exoerience has given in to the pressure of these rnt joints and now has young staff supplying HE. Haven't experienced this myself as yet when serenity is just up the road. But maybe it is worth a visit to see what new talent they have hired.

I think you need to send out a very clear signal at some places and with some ladies. Sometimes that signal would appear to be little short of pulling off the towel, covering your dick with glitter and shining a flashlight on it! :P

Seriously, I find that a few gentle touches of the lady's legs when she's in position doing the massage is all it takes to start getting that message across. But it doesn't always work. I recall a while back on an overseas trip, going into a Chinese massage place which I got the feeling was legit for some customers (eg women) but HJ for some guys if you sent the right signal â€“ so I tried to send that signal, during the massage while face-down, I gave a gentle stroke to the legs of the (late 20s? early-30s?) massage lady while she was at the head the table, to feel out the territory so to speak.

No resistance, no moving away, so I repeated it, stroking her (quite nice) calves and bottom, gently, long strokes to show I was a gentle guy. Not a bit of resistance from her, so I figured the 'extras' would be on - but no hint as she worked my upper legs, and when we got to the 'please turn over' bit despite FlyBoy Jnr standing to attention, she carefully draped the towel (which is sometimes just a pretension to modesty before the tug is offered), worked the legs and upper legs, then bang, she says "Time up" and pretty much walks out the door

If I'd not been visiting this place with a female colleague (under the pretence of it being a legit massage place, and we both desiring some back massage after our long flight from Sydney) I've have extended my stay and asked for extras, but the abruptness of this end-of-massage and that she didn't even let me know 10 minutes in advance of the end (as they often do, leaving the choice of activities for those final 10 minutes of massage up to you) was a bit of a shock after I'd sent what I thought was a clear message!

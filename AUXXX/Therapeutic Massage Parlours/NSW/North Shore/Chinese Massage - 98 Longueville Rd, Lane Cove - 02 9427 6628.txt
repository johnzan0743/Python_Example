Chinese Massage, Shop 3, 98 Longueville Rd, Lane Cove. Tel 9427 6628

Massage - $60/$45/$30 60/45/30 mins

Yuki

After years of wondering if there was a R&T joint in Lane Cove, I now know the answer!

Saw a late 20's/early 30's Chinese lady Yuki, absolutely tiny! I have a friend who like his ladies to fit under his chin, well, this lady barely came up to my nipples! I think she might be Superman's Chinese sister, since the strength in her hands bore no relation to her size! At the intro she asked if I wanted a massage 'down below', an extra $25.

Only had time for 30 mins, she had another booking, and I believe they do have a shower, just wasn't given an importunity to use if due to time restraints.

The room was a reasonable size, clean and  had rails up near the ceiling for those into back walks!

Massage was pretty good, nice and firm, with a nice amount of tackle tickle.

Rolled over and started the tug and the value added up-selling spiel.

clothes off was another $25, bbbj an extra $60, she had to be kidding!
I tried to tell her what I could get for that kind of money elsewhere, but she stuck to her guns. Fair enough.
Now if she had looked like Lucy Lui then I would still be there, but she didn't,she was just a reasonably cute near midget giving me a hand-job 

I think they usually have at least two ladies working, and are open till 10pm

Value for money? so so

Repeat visit/recommend? Yes

 Lane Cove Massage - 18/01/10 - Lucy

Lane Cove Massage 98 Longueville Road 9427 6628

When back to visit this little masage place, markets itself as a legit place, has great parking behind in the council carpark and a discrete entrance.

Lucy greeted me at teh door, an attractive enough girl, mi 30's I'd say. Shown into a nice enough room, off with the gear, left the undies on as a sort of test, she came in and said get them off, (!!!) I thought.

Real massage table, typical Chinese charts on wall and a big sign "No Sex Massage".

Lucy was plainly dressed, no low cut top, (no real boobs either, but that is OK).

Typical back and neck massage, arms etc, asked if a little oil was OK, "sure".

Lucy started on my legs, good enoguth massage, skimmed the sack, swapped legs skimming the sack again.

Asks me to turn over and then asks if I want hand job, how much $20, so OK.

As usual, I need a hand full, so I've lifted her top, she is not that interested, but allows me with a smile.

Soon I drop load and relax. 

She offers a hot towel and gives me a great rub down, as good as the massage all over again.

I get dressed and I am on my way.

All up, $35 for the 30min rub ($60 for an hour), and $20 for the tug, not bad value for money.

I'll be back.

Seriously, for the money and its proximity to Albany, I'd get in the car and drive for three minutes more.  Albany,...well, you do not go there for the massage, well most people do not go there for the massage. .

Evil Genius, you have to pay extra for the massage. Which makes Albany different to most other places where you have to pay extra for everything else! :P

Found this place a few weeks ago.Massage $60 and HJ was an extra $20 as the OP mentioned

My massage was great, with a lot of attention on the legs and back, which felt great. The masseuse must have had some training because this was not just some light feathery thing, i realy felt muscles that I had no felt in a while.

Masseuse was chatty and friendly, I think her name was jenny or something like that.
Well worth a visit.

Popped in yesterday to give this place a go - $60 for 60 mins.

Saw GiGi, OK looking - mid to late 30's at a guess.

Massage was very good, I'd say she has had some sort of formal training. No tackle contact at all. About halfway through she asked me to turn over, and then asked if I wanted a 'special massage' for another $20. Took her up on the offer.

HJ was OK, alllowed me to touch through her clothes. Did offer to take them off for another $50. Declined at that rate!

Wouldn't go back for a few reasons - got shorted by about 10-15 mins; lost probably another 5 mins when she left the room numerous times to answer the door; and even though their ad in the local paper and the sign on the outside of the place states Helth Fund Rebates, when I enquired about them GiGi claimed she did not understand.

Basically much better VFM can be found elsewhere.

Cheers,

BAB

This is a place which I have visited a number of times, and I will happily return in the future.  The establishment is owned and operated by Amy, a pocket-rocket from southern China and a lovely lady to boot.  The shop has recently been completely renovated and now boasts three private massage rooms, each with air-conditioning and adjustable lighting.  

The renovation has ensured that one of the massage rooms is no longer adjacent to an adjoining office, and I imagine that, as the walls are certainly not double brick, this is a "win-win" for both parties.

Amy would easily be the fittest masseuse that I know, and when she's not performing a very competent massage, can be seen at the nearby gym or in the local streets, pounding out a 10+ km run or preparing for another City-to-Surf.

Amy has a number of assistants rotating during the course of a week.  Some days you might get the pleasure of a massage with Jinji, a wonderful lady from Qingdao (which just happens to be one of the first Mandarin words I ever learnt, being synonymous with "beer").  To say that Jinji has a sunny disposition would be the understatement of the year, every time I have had the pleasure of her company, she positively radiates warmth and happiness.  In short, I don't know what she's on, but I would definitely like some of it!  Both Amy and Jinji are in their early 40s but would easily pass for 10 years younger.

Occasionally, I've had the pleasure of a massage here with Candy, who is quite young and very pretty (I guess late 20s but looks early 20s) and who has incredibly soft hands.

Anyway, back to Amy and Jinji, both are attractive and very pleasant ladies who are always happy to share a joke or too.  Once you're a bit of a regular, the welcome from Jinji is, as they say, worth the price of admission alone.  All the ladies here have got great pins (as well as their other obvious physical attributes) and the short nurses uniforms (sometimes maroon, sometimes sky blue) show these off to great advantage.  It's also great to see the interaction between Amy and Jinji, they obviously get on extremely well together and I can only imagine that a double booking with these fine ladies would be a very memorable experience.  Perhaps this could be the subject of a subsequent review.

Apologies for posting another very positive review, but I have always found the massage here to be excellent.  I guess, as a repeat customer, a positive review goes without saying.  Maybe I am just lucky, but if you show courtesy and respect, I think you will be amply rewarded during your time here.  Irrespective of whether you see Jinji (Thursday Â– Saturday), Candy (Wednesday & Sunday) or Amy (most days), I feel confident you will leave here with a smile on your face and a repeat booking on your mind.

I visited this place 3 weeks ago, on a saturday morning. Got a massage from Jinji. The massage was actually pretty good, and fairly strong, even though I requested "medium". It was so strong that she left me a few bruises on my back.

Amy was also there, and you are totally right, Lucky Tiger, they are both really nice and friendly.

Once the massage was finished, she started some light touching in my bum, it was actually quite pleasant. It didn't last much, as it was time for turning over...

Then she started the tug, and it was ok. I tried some touching, but it was clear to me that she didn't quite like it. And now the worst part: she started telling me that I should cum quickly... Now, why is it so difficult for women to understand that you cannot rush a man like this? It is a real turn off... Things take time, ladies, especially when you are not 18...

I think I paid around 55$ for 30$, including the tug.

Will I be back? Maybe for Amy, but not for Jinji. I don't need more bruises, and I certainly don't want to be rushed.

Have had several double massages with Amy and Jinjin and they were great massages... they work very well in pairs.  Also have had some tag team massages where one starts and the other finishes.  Amy is a great girl and doesn't know her own strenght, so hard means hard!  Amy is trying to keep the place on the straight so doesn't encourage anything else - the addition of the beauty room for facials, etc, is testament to that.  For a great massage only, a great place.

G'day lads. Amy used to own the Shop in denley Lane at St ives as well as the Longueville road shop. Quite a few years ago now. She used to do a hj back in the old days but not now or so it would appear. Just wondering if anyone has gotten a HJ off Amy in the Lane Cove shop and if so how recently. I think she may have gone totally straight...worse luck...

I use to visit this shop every few months when i lived in lane cove for a few years on the walk home from the bus stop. always saw amy or gingin... great massage and great tug. never asked for more and wasnt interested in more.
once was treated with a double massage by Amy for no extra cost or ask. She randomly called gin in once she was onto my legs, flipped over and had both massaging and tugging. i miss it and think i need a trip back on the weekend to rediscover!

Visited Lane Cove now ex r'n't' Massage Longueville Road Lane Cove last weekend report as follows

Name :- Amy
Length of massage :- 1 hour
Cost :- $65
Service :- massage ONLY

Amy does a great massage but this place whilst only semi busy is now more or less a Remedial massage joint. No longer entertaining the troops here boys.

Thought I'd try an old trick and leave extra money on the table. Was told in no uncertain terms that this was not necessary only massage on offer here.

As I had been a fan of Amy's work at St Ives after having met her in her first establishment at Gladesville many years ago I thought I would try the cash is king method.

To prove a point that this place should now probably be filed under Therapeutic Straight venues I offered Amy a big numbered amount of money shall we say more than a days takings to do a hand job but she declined...she said it was not about money her shop does not do anything other than massage and it was going to stay that way.

Now I know that other girls do a hj here but if the boss says no and if she catches the girl according to Amy she will sack the girl by giving them no more shifts.
She was very adamant. It seems as if she genuinely wants to remain legit and this is her business so if she wants that then that should be respected.
I mean respected until she starts losing business enough to start doing the tug or allowing her girls to do it again.

BTW she used to get her gear off at St Ives and she does a pretty mean tug (Yes they are specatacular). She used to be rather amicable but is now very serious about things and shouted that was the way things were now....point was not lost on me and perhaps if her business model which is based on a false premise of getting punters in and then blueballing them and turfing them out knowing they will be back to try again well at some point she should start losing business enough to suggest that her policy will send her broke or achieve what she wants which is compliant clients who accept that at times interrupted massage whilst she takes care of business because she is too cheap to employ a receptionist.

Anyway fellow punters until she sees the light or unless you know another girl who will def do extras or just a simple hj perhaps it is best to stay clear. It is not cheap and she is not registered for health Fund rebates inspite of what she advertises. So no luck there either.
Unless you are looking for an at times competant massage followed by blue balls then perhaps this shop should now be filed under Purely Therapeutic massage only
although I fail to see how blue balls are in any way therapeutic...

The other girls there fear Amy...and the girl (Rose) who works most of the shifts Amy doesn't cover has an unfortunate real sour look as well as a really sour attitude towards clients so no joy there...

WIR not for another 6 or so months and only if I read on the forum that Amy has woken up that punters have other options speaking of which I needed to visit another place to offload my cash and sack...

And that my friend is exactly what I did....those tits are a fond memory...as for your Health fund some not all are not fussy and will pay without checking.
It depends really upon the fund. However Amy does not have a provider number nor a Hicaps machine or a Health Provider number but my health fund doesn't ask questions either in fact most health funds allow up to $500 each year for remedial massage rebates and figure that checking costs more than what it costs to pay out.
Amy doesn't like giving receipts on less than a 60 minute massage...but will oblige if asked politely. I haven't asked this year as I know she is not registered as Remedial due to having fake certificates displayed in the past. Best to pretend evrything is above board and submit receipts until told otherwise.
She does not mind cockteasing just doesn't like touching them anymore...

Ah such is life....have a good break Sparksy and get your strength back for new punting adventures next year....

I wish I had as much energy as your goodself...
look forward to reading the adventures of the MLC Milfbuster next year...

 Rose at Lane Cove
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Rose

Establishment : Lane Cove Therapeutic Massage

Date of Visit : 7/02/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :Lane Cove Therapeutic Massage | LCTM

Hours of Business : 10-7

Rates : 60mins / $100

Age : mid to late 30s

Size/shape : petite

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, RNT

Value for money/recommend? : Nope

My experience/comments : Dropped in here as I had heard they give a good massage with more. Rose answered the door and I was taken into the room. I was told a half hour massage was $40 with special ending extra $20. I agreed. This place, although clean does not have showers and is a little cramped. After undressing, I laid on the table and Rose came in and started what was really a fairly average massage. There was a really off putting chinese mandolin cd put on and although it was quiet, it sort of ruined it form me.
Rose was wearing a uniform and after enquiring, I was told it would be an extra $50 to go topless only. Touching was allowed through the clothes but by that stage I was not really interested. The ending was very mechanical and Rose seemed really disinterested in the whole ordeal. This on top of the fact that she had to leave the room three times in thirty minutes to answer the front door will mean that this was just a punt and I will not be returning here in a hurry.
Perhaps she had an off day but it was a once only experience for me and $110 for a half hour topless massage would have been a total rip off. As it was $60 was thrown away here.

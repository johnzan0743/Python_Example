My Experience:

Had been to 90 Mount street and passed this place. I like thai massage and saw the special on this place so though it would check it out. Business could be slow and that could mean a better than normal massage experience. Very clean and professional place curtained rooms. Massage girl came out greeted and was giggling a lot. Thought this could be a good sign. Through to the room and opted for the oil massage. When she returned she said massage only ok!. I figured this was going to be a relaxing hour and thats all. Started with my back and worked her way down i asked for hard but it was only medium for me. When she got to my legs there was a bit of high rubs to the inner thigh and i lifted a bit to give access but nothing more eventuated. On the turn over to do my legs and arms there was a significant rise in the towel. She gave a small giggle but no offers or attention to that. In all an average massage for my liking and definitely a legit place but worth trying these places out you never know..

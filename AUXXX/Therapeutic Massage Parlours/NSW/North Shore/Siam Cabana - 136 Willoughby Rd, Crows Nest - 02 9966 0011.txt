 Siam Cabana - 136 Willoughby Rd, Crows Nest - 02 9966 0011
				
Post Content: 
For locals and those who pass through this area from time to time, Siam Cabana is a relatively new (coupla months) and up-market Thai massage place on the corner of Willoughby Road and Albany Street. (I believe it's the second in the chain, with an existing Siam Cabana running in Bondi.)

Siam Cabana is very legit-looking, but muddies the mix a bit by being open until 10pm, which is unusual for a 100% legit place. That's really not fair, you know. There should be a law which decrees that legit places must close at 6pm, and anything after-hours must provide extras! :P

Anyway, if anyone is tempted to try it out and report back......

For those who don't know The FlyBoy Review Style from previous boards such as FIA, MFIA and SDU, allow me to explain  I'll sometimes set the scene, tell a tale, weave a narrative rather than jump straight into the details.

And so it is with this visit to Siam Cabana. But to save you the trouble of reading further to get the details - this place is indeed 'no extras'.

Oh, okay, you want to know more? Read on, by all means.

Having a few weeks back restarted my daily gym routine in order to shed a few of those winter kilos, the same thing happened as always when I hit the weights & cardio routine  the endorphins and testosterone start flowing and very soon I'm 'up for it', and being single that means a slightly higher frequency of visits to Asian rub'n'tug places (it settles down after a fortnight or so, it's just the initial surge sorta kick-starts my body).

But this week I'm feeling a different stiffness, that of two solid weeks' workouts, so I decided that I really wanted a good massage. I'm talking really good - not just relaxing but actually therapeutic, although stopping short of making my tired muscles ache more by pulling and stretching.

I toy with the idea of visiting a rub'n'tug place where the massage is actually good, and that depends on the lady of course  but I decide instead to try Siam Cabana, figuring that at the very least I know for 100% sure that I'll get a decent massage of the type I want - and if extras happen to be on offer than that's a bonus, and if not (which I expected) then that's also fine, nothing lost, and I an report back here to save other punters who are more tug-inclined.

So I call Siam Cabana and make an appointment for the 60 minute 'body massage with oil', which costs around $70 by memory. I'm assigned a cute friendly Thai girl named 'Trolley' or 'Truly' or something like that, and after a short footbath she ushers me into one of the little massage rooms and leaves me to prep. I strip all the way down, she returns and the massage begins.

As I said, it's a good massage  and if this is all you are seeking, by all means give it a whirl. It's been a long time since I've enjoyed an hour-long rub sans tug! But never does Trolley give a hint of anything extra, and nor do I attempt to suggest such - for there's a little sign on the wall in the reception area saying something like "Traditional Thai massage does not involve any sexual activity. Do not ask for any sexual services or you may be asked to leave the premises."

Now of course many of us have been to places where they have similar signs in the reception area and in each room, yet for a $20 or $50 that no longer applies (if it ever did, many times those signs are more to clear the owner in case the girls are sprung by council). But that's simply not this place.

Anyway, massage done I dress and head back to the reception area, where I'm served a cup of a truly delightful Thai tea called 'Bael Fruit' tea. I also notice a cute young Aussie-Asian girl near me, having her legs and feet massaged by one of the male staff, and I am briefly envious (I like cute girls, I like Asian girls, I like Aussie-Asian girls, I like legs and feet and I like to massage   so you do the math!).

One suggestion, though. Don't go for this massage on a full or even half-full bladder. There's a small but persistently loud water fountain in the foyer, and the effect of lying on the massage table for an hour listing to the water splashing down could summon within you the urge to unleash your own personal fountain!

Mate,

I have eyed this place off over a couple of weeks, and apart from not really being your end of Crows Nest (in joke here), it REEKS of legit.  If you want to really TOFTT, try the Balmain Chinese massage on the opposite corner in the Red Brick building, or the massage place under the Franklin's, been there but legit. (New Japaneses restaurant next door, shared a few words with the pretty hostess the other night, so it might have an unexpected benefit).

Seen it, but never ventured in.

Yeah, I had no expectations that this place was anything but mega legit  figured that the chance of any extras was like 0.01%, and would at best be a 'happy ending' tug to give the girl some spending money, but as I said, I knew going in that this was very very unlikely and I wasn't even holding out for it  just wanted a proper massage and thought, hey, happy ending or not I'll still be 'happy' with the hour and have something to report back here!

That's pretty much it, actually - it's like a much larger spa resort from Thailand has been squeezed down and transplanted to Crows Nest. Really is a nice way to spend an hour, and I could see myself making a habit of this... but I could also see other people making a habit of it while I make a habit of some fave rub'n'tug'more places!

Been here a couple of times since it opened. Have had different experiences each time I go. The ladies do a pretty good massage and tend to listen to your wishes, something I have seen different in a lot of other places. Absolutely no RnT on over here, just the rub. The atmosphere is very cute with all the running water and decorations. Very Thai indeed. The last time I went here, I vowed not to go back. You never get to choose your masseuse (at least I never did) and I ended up with this guy who absolutely wrecked my shoulders and back. It still hurts even thinking about it, so if every you end up visiting this place, make sure you don't get him. It should be pretty easy as he is the only gent there (just my luck!)

I have to say, that their foot reflexology treatment is simply awesome! Highly recommended.

I too love the way this place stays open till late. Has anyone noticed the ridiculous amount of security cameras here? I guess that's how it is possible to stay open late and keeps the weirdos away?

Corner of Willoughby Rd and Albany St as FlyBoy said. Mmmm Albany St - memories.....

I believe the same management is behind the place that has recently had council approval to operate at 407 Pacific Hwy Crows Nest. Same building as the Red Lantern.

407 was formerly a shop called Top 3 by Design. Perhaps (hopefully?) they plan a similarly themed massage place?

Simon,

All the guff about it can be found on North Sydney Council's website here. Somewhere in that documentation, the applicant refers to Siam Cabana as the other place he is operating to allay the fears that the new 407 place will be operating as a brothel. Perish the thought

I've been to Siam Cabana many times when I'm after a decent real massage and not interested in looking for any extras. All the staff I have encountered a generally well trained and can give a great massage. Have always left feeling pretty damn good. I go for the 90minute combo, 30min foot/hr traditonal Thai. Pricey at $98 but they really do give a top notch service.

I have to agree on this, absolutely!

Went here (again) last Sunday and had a one hour Thai massage followed by 1/2h in the sauna.

The massage was excellent!!! And totally legit, but that was what I was there for.
It included a 20 minute walk on hot coals (sorry I meant my back and legs, but she was very careful). 
She really knew what she was doing - they are properly trained. Not a single time did she misstep or do anything that would hurt (relative) and my back has not felt so good for a long time.
But let us be honest; if I'm going to let someone to walk all over me, let it be someone who weighs 40 kg - so she was perfect for that.

The sauna is just an infrared sauna, but it did what I was looking for. Had a quick shower in the spa tub afterwards.

So I was there for 2 hours, total damage $95, I left totally rejuvenated (to look for the happy ending for the day).

It does make me wonder that if the owner of Siam cabana also owns the new place at 407 which apparently links into 6 alexander st, have they recruited some of the girls from Siam. There are some absolute cuties working there, and i wouldn't mind getting an rnt from some of those girls. I wonder......

I find it very hard to believe that these places have the same owner.
I've been to both and the difference between girls and service in these places is like day and night. (Not referring to the girl at 6 Alexander, different girls there than in 407).

407 and 6 are both owned by an older Asian 'lady' who also owns Aromas massage (Northern Beaches) and 232 military rd, which both are closer to a brothel than a massage place.

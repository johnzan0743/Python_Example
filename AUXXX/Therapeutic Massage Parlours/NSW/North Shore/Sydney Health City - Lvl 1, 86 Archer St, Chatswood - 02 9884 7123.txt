My experience/comments: After SeaRay mentioning this in the post for 76a Archer St, I thought I would TOFTT.

The bad news is this place appears to 100% legit. In the foyer they are selling all sorts of Chinese herbs, as well as Dermalogica products, so my initial impression was this is legit.

Was instructed at the outset to leave undies on. There was zero tackle tickling or brushing throughout the massage.

The good news is they offer a great massage. The ML I had was very good at her art. The rooms are very clean, and they have proper massage tables (not the wooden frame with wafer thin padding). The rooms are private, although this is not as relevant as it is not a RNT. Not that I asked if extras were on offer, but it is fair to say that with a bit of experience you can establish this for yourself when there are enough indications that the place is set-up for legir purposes only.

For those that mat be interested, they also offer a range of other services, including facials (not the sexual type!!), peels, pedicures, eyebrow tinting & all sorts of waxing.  So knock yourself out fellas!!! 

They also offer health fund rebates.

Cheers,

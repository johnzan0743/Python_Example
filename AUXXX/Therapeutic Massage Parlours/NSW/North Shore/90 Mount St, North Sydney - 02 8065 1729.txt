My experience/comments : The business card for this shop just says "Health Centre" but I'm sure the sign on the outside of the shop, with flashing lights etc, it more like "Chinese Massage" of some sort. Locals will know the place, others won't find it hard to spot. 90 Mount Street is a small group on shops stepping down from the street into a food court, almost across the road from Aldi. Down the steps and turn sharp left, this place looks a bit dingy from the outside, and the inside too. Large rooms all around a central area, almost looks like converted offices or something. But the rooms seem clean enough.

Hot MILF sitting across from the receptionist, I figured I would get her, ponied up for the hour. She leads me into the room, I undress and lie on the table, in comes a different girl, 'YoYo'. Wish I'd got the MILF!

YoYo is SoSo in looks , and not one I'd choose. And she won't shut the fuck up. Yap yap yap all through the first half of the massage, going on about the same thing, you married, you single, where you live, you have kids blah blah blah. I don't answer much at all, she finally seems to get the hint after half an hour!

Her massage itself is decent, time to turn over and have some fun, she offers $50 for bodyslide. Now I'm not that impressed by her body and it's a warm day so I am fine just to have a happy ending. But she keeps trying to sell the bodyslide, then thinks I am concerned by the pricing and says "First time customer $50, regular customer cheaper, you come see me more, you pay less, I do more".

"More?" I ask? This is taking an interesting turn. "You regular I do bodyslide $40 or $30, blowjob, sex" she says. "I need money, you come see me, I take very good care of you, you not pay much money."

I decided to stay with the handjob for now, offer her a straight $20 for that. She starts and it's a decent job, I work a hand under her light dress, over her tummy, up to her boobs, then pop one out to taste it. She must think this is a good way to convert a first-timer into a regular because she disengages, walks to the corner of the room, offs all her clothes, comes back and gets into the HJ while I finger her to a nice wet stage.

As YoYo works her hand down around my balls she slides a finger towards my crack, does some gentle rimming and noticing my response, keeps working that, then asks "You want finger in?". So she pulls a small container of gloves out from a drawer, slides one on and goes for the date.

That gets me far enough across then line to unload all over my stomach and her boobs. "You very strong!" she laughs!

The job done, she gets back into her clothes, goes out, comes back with the warm wet towels for a cleanup, and once again starts to "sell" herself to me, "You come back next time, bodyslide $40, also suck and fuck if you like, I need money" etc.

I give her $50, she makes change and comes back with $30, I give her an extra $10 which she didn't ask for but I figure she went "above and beyond" in her service.

All the same I'm not going back to see her, no real connection or attraction. Might be a good pick for some guys who are big on value and want to see what they can get, I'd rather try my luck with the MILF!

[COLOR=#333333][COLOR=#333333]This shop is tucked away on Mount Street in North Sydney. It's pretty big but it's down a set of stairs so you can walk past it pretty easily. It's right next door to a mobile phone accessory store.

[COLOR=#333333]I reckon it's kind of run down looking inside but I think they actually get some legitimate customers. I actually ran into one when I was leaving and she gave me a weird stare![/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]I only saw one massage girl working but there must have been like five rooms in the place. Two of them were rooms with doors and then some other curtained areas at the back. I was assigned to one of the rooms but didn't catch the girls name.

The massage was ok, just a standard non-therapeutic massage I guess but it was quite relaxing. At the 45 minute mark she asked me to turn over and gave the hand motion. I agreed and she gave a great oiled up handjob.

All up it was $60 for an hour massage and $20 for part two. Pretty standard cheap and cheerful place, recommended if you work close by but wouldn't travel for it.

This is my first visit here and came about in response to some chat with the shop owner who hit me up on wechat some time before revealing her shop association. An attractive lady and I'm looking forward to meeting her soon 

It can be confusing... up the stairs, the door to Suite 3 is immediately before another shop at Suite 2/84a. There is some tension between ownerships here... Penny at S2 perhaps described as an enthusiastic poacher of customers who may be heading for this Thai shop. Quote - "Important notice:there is a Thai massage next to our shop, same floor,dont go there, we are different" they say. I make no judgement, simply calling it (and reviewing both) as I see it... I have now been once to both shops and will spread my future custom to each one as I choose. However, 'predatory' can be the situation at the top of the stairs... so just be aware of where you have chosen to go.

Sunday is quiet and I'm told by the cuddly girl who greets me that I am her first customer today... around 4pm. I have booked and she is sitting at the desk waiting (movement down the corridor is ignored). This Thai shop has just two small rooms with curtains as doors. There is an air-con in the left room which serves both as the walls don't quite reach the ceiling. While a little cramped, the room is adequate with a wide massage table. Yes, different from S2.

This girl introduces as 'Hola'... but could be 'Pola'... that cute north-eastern Thai lilt can be confusing. She instructs me to take everything off... she actually says it twice... to be sure to be sure! I'm already happy 

Hola commences with a very firm massage through a towel. She is a strong girl with a very firm bod... obviously works out. While she is 'cuddly' she's in perfect proportion... with an absolutely awesome C+ rack 

I stroke her legs at appropriate intervals to offer encouragement as she uses limited oil for an effective rub. As she gets to my legs, she moves them wide apart, sitting up between them for full access. There's some TT after she quietly asks, "Would you like a happy ending?" I like no-nonsense girls... it's +50 for nudity 

After a hot towel cleanup of the back and legs, I turn over. It's a B2B approach and I must say those splendid breasts sliding over the torso have the desired affect... even a little spanish thrown in. Finally, Hola stands beside me allowing access to her nether region... she works my sword with hands of experience as I massage her fully-engorged, slightly furry vulva. It's not too long before I'm pumping out soldiers all over the place... "Oh so much... now you're happy!" she smiles. Indeed I am!

I'm cleaned up comprehensively and there's a very friendly and appreciative farewell. Hola/Pola works here Friday and Sunday and elsewhere most other days. She mentioned "Thai town" but maybe it was "Chinatown".

So yes, these two shops are different but if more Thai floats your boat, Suite 3 is worth a visit 

I can't believe the number of shops along this stretch and interestingly, almost all have either an "8" or combo in the addy... lucky numbers for north side punters indeed

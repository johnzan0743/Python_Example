Prices: $35 1/2 $55 1hr + $15 for the tug

Age: 30+

Size/shape:10 peach shape with A cups

Nationality or Ethnicity:PRC

Services:Fantastic quality massage with tug

Value for money/recommend?:Yes I will be back this week

My experience/comments: Went to this place a couple of years ago but it was legite.Dropped in there the other day and Elaine was busy but she had that look about her (dick puller look) so I went back on Friday in the name of research. Booked for 30mins but extended for 1 hr immediately as the massage was good but could have been slightly stronger. Anyway after a great massage the soft touching and butt stroking starts and I know its on. I started rubbing Elaines leg and she had no issues as I gently made my way up to her panties and felt inside. A little hairy for me but quickly very wet. By now she was really getting into the tug and bent down to give a little kiss to the sack and lower shaft area, Hello am I about to get an unsolicited BBBJ? not today but in the future maybe.

Anyway time to turn over for some serious fingering whilst Elaine is gently paying attention to the little boy and slowly working him to a frenzy. Great experience and only would except $15 additional toll for the extra's, she says she wants to make money slowly HeHe I like her attitude. Says she is busy and I can see why, this is a quite, discrete shop inside upstairs in a office block so AXR members don't be stupid and fuck it up.......I neally didn't post this review but that wouldn't be fair would it.
There is a little neon massage sign above the doorway and a tax shops board near the door. Enter go up the stairs to the left and the shop is first on the left at the top of the stairs. Only one girl there each day and Elaine does not work everyday. She is there minimum 3 days per week including Thurs/Frid

When I was leaving Elaine says next time will be better WTF!!!! I have found another one in Chatswood!

Cheers punters

Gentlemen,

Full credit to Sparksy here and as he suggests, "lets not fuck this up".

What amazes me is that there is room for yet another RNT shop in Chatswood,..there must be a marketing theory about all shops being located together and having clients come to them.

Well done!!

Hi Sparksy, you are lucky one. I'd been there couple days after the opening with discount price. I saw Rain(2 times/1hour each), she is over 30, good looking, with a professional skill of massage. She does the back and the front too, but ...(sad)without extra.
There is a second shop on Victoria St.. Sorry I don't remember the number. I think this is the place for someone looking a good pure massage, you won't be disappointed. Cheers.

Good one Sparksy. This establishment advertises in the North Shore Times: -

CHINESE Remedial Relaxing Massage Clinic. Se 6 76A / 78 Archer St CHATSWOOD (first floor). Under new mgt. Phone (02) 8095-2066

I've been meaning to try this place for a few weeks now - thanks for the heads-up. I am interested in "Rain" - there used to be a Rain working with Linda Lees at 3/341 Victoria Ave who was exceptional at massage but no extras back then either. However she was quite lovely to be in the room with and I got the sense a regular might have received more. Must pay a visit here to see if she's the same. And yes - let's not fuck this up!!!

Gentlemen,

Tried there this morning, the place was closed to at least 11:00am, the phone number quoted in the previous post was disconnected.

Compared to some of the other RNT's in Chatswood this one appears newer and cleaner that many others.

I ended up parking in Chatswood Chase.

Will have to keep trying

Searay,

I am a little geographically challenged based upon your instructions, there is a massage place on the corner of Archer and Victoria, upstairs suite 107.  Good for a MILF RNT, do not know about an anal fingering though.

http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/showth...t=victoria+ave

(Anal fingering is Roses speciality at 6/21 Willoughby on a Wed or Sat.)

I went to this place about 5 months ago in the week that it opened.. I actually rang when I first saw the add and at that point they (well it seemed to be just one lady) were still a couple weeks from opening up and whilst the massage and happy ending were pretty good i didn't think it warranted a return visit.. the milf wasn't pretty but had a decent looking bod but there was no 'clothes off' option....

The SeaRay needing a good RnT walked past this establishment Yesterday and popped in for an hour with out having read up on their services, ELAINE was on by herself and it was a great hours massage for the $55 which had a lot of tackle tickle from the moment I got on the table...the ole sore groin excuse !....when it came time to the HJ........well it's me and it did get a little hot, she was sweating under her Bra which was wet which is why I had to remove it...so being very polite I couldn't leave her skirt & undies on...better leave it at that....needless the SeaRay will be returning......I have now started asking instead of a Happy Ending, I now ask for a Happy Start " H.S. " there is a new one MODS a HS...Elaine certainly has long nibbles for one that has never had a child.

Was down at the rta today so decided to call in for a massage. 
For those finding the directions confusing it's suite 6, right at the top of the stairs. 
Unfortunately Elaine wasn't working today so I had a massage with what sounded like Woohoo. Difficult to understand as her English is non existent.
She did have $40 for 30mins and $60 for 60 mins written on a pad, so I guess prices are up a little.
Took the hour. 
Fortunately her massage was excellent. Frankly probably the best I've had in a long time and that's saying something. Slightly rough hands which felt great. Good pressure and good use of forearms. 
I wasnt sure if there would be extras in offer, but there was some good crack work as well as some inner upper thigh work. 
Turnover time came and she surprised me by continuing to massage my legs face up, ignoring the mongrel in her face. Still, the massage was excellent!
After the legs she asked in sign language about a HJ for $20. 
She had fun working out that she could use two hands one on top of the other and told me in Chinese that  I had a big cock but she didn't have a big pussy (or at least that was my interpretation). She did lift her top but didn't want to take the pants off (although she didn't mind me rubbing her to orgasm through her pants). 
After she milked out a lovely big load she wrapped my cock up like a mummy, draped the towel over it and continued the fantastic massage. 
So a great massage with a decent ending. Only downer was that I swear she was folding up the towels and relaying them on the bed.

Was in Chatswood on a Tuesday a couple of weeks ago and decided to try this place. Walked up the stairs and through the door and there were 2 Chinese MILFS there.  One who had short curly hair took me into a room and I settled for a 30min massage for $35.00.  Her name was Lily and would probably be late 30's maybe early 40's   Not great looking but friendly personalit.  Asked if I had been before and when I said no she promised a "good" massage, with a look in her eyes.

Started with massage which was good and after about 10 mins started a bit of tackle tickle and I asked about extras and it was $20 for HJ + another $20 for clothes off, which we agreed to. She is a bit on the chubby side but has a great pair of natural boobs probably size C.  Looked good and felt good.

She gave a good tug and allowed a feel of her pussy, licked nipples licked.  I was soon cumming.  Hot towel to finish and requested i come back again soon.   Works Tuesdays only and may not be to some punters tastes, but I enjoyed the session, will probbaly try this shop again when in the area.

Value for money/recommend? Yes/yes

My experience/comments:

With all the good press on Elaine and my quick ½ hr introductory rnt with her a week or two before, rang to request a full-length (pardon the pun) 1 hr return session. Lily answered, to inform me that Elaine was "out doing some business". My devious mind boggles at what that might mean home visits perhaps?! How presumptuous of me. Anyway, she seemed quite unsure as to Elaine's return on the day.

Lily is quite a sales lady  she convinces me to "Come and try me out, I look after you very well." A familiar mantra but, OK. I accede, despite apprehension at Elaine's unavailability. I arrive to take an hour with the vivacious Lily.

Lily is very chatty and friendly and complimentary with her banter. You know the lines oooh, sexy man, sexy body, blah blah blah. Although bullshit, it does make an old fart feel good 

Lily gives an excellent massage  strong, relieves the knots in all the right places and after around 40 minutes, heads for the tackle very accomplished she is too, had me barred up in moments. I flip over to her further compliments but yeah, yeah, Lily, it's not that big! 

As she's touching me up big time, I go the grope on her and she offers to remove her top for a tip... now I have to say, Lily is a real Chinese MILF. About 5'5" happy face, curly hair, somewhat plump but sexy as, with one of the best racks on a mature woman I've seen. Gorgeous C-cups, perfect shape with pert, firm organ-stops. I doubt they're enhanced, she was just at the front of the queue when the top tits were handed out lovely to grasp and play with and she seemed to enjoy the attention 

As my band began to play, I went for her nether regions and even through her tights, found her delightfully wet she seemed to enjoy that attention as well. Her tug was exemplary rhythm, tension, all just right. The reveille sounded felt like I sprayed the room Lily seemed very impressed I was ecstatic 

She cleaned up with warm towels and as I dressed, Lily continued her sales pitch for return visits she works, "Here Tuesdays only; also at Mosman  nice areas, nice generous men" WTF ?! No doubt, I will return sometime soon who knows what "generosity" may bring forth?

 Thought I would try Elaine....

Person's Name : Elaine

Establishment : Chatswood natural Therapy Clinic, Archer St.

Date of Visit : 18 June 2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 8095 0266

Hours of Business :  7 days until 7pm

Rates : $60 for the hour (didn't ask about other times)

Age : 30s or early 40s - not sure

Size/shape : slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

Having read good reviews of Elaine, I thought I would pop in on Saturday evening about 6pm to try here out. I was definitely not disappointed.

I was the only customer and Elaine greeted me in a very happy, friendly, smiling way, then started with a reasonably medium to strong massage, better than many I have received in the past from similar establishments, and it really helped to get the kinks out, since I had been doing quite some physical work earlier in the day. The leg massage was quite strong - not what I would call sensual, even there was plenty of brushing up against the sack - but therapeutic nonetheless.

The fact that it was quite strong, even when up around the 'sensitive' area led me to wonder what would actually happen, but then at about the 40 minute mark, she started running her nails up and down the length of my body and asked me if I would like a HJ for $20. I said yes, and asked if she would strip for me. She said she would and when I rolled over she said (with a mischievous grin) she would go and lock up the shop and put up the 'closed' sign. Sounding better and better....

Anyway, needless to say, some fun naked time was had in the ensuing 15-20 minutes. The handjob was great, with some nice little kisses of the sack and base of the old boy - and my fingers ended up nice and wet too, I must say. Blew quite a beauty. Elaine was being picked up after work, but intimated she would have liked to stay longer.

All in all a very pleasant experience, and I aim to return as soon as possible, especially since Elaine suggested that more might be on offer if there was more time.

Saw Wendy. Horrible massage. Asked if I wanted hard or medium then I said hard and for the rest of the massage she proceeded to give me a bunch of flimsy palm presses like a bored cat pawing. I thought asking for oil (which either wasn't part of the massage but more likely she simply couldn't be bothered with unless pressed) would change the style but she just wiped some on and continued as before. I've seen good masseuses use this palm press for 2 mins to warm up before they dig in but that never came. I also later realized that when she gave me change she had helped herself to an extra five which I wasn't sharp enough to call out at the time.

I'm really sick of the half hearted massages around... Nothing worse than lying down and realizing that you've blown your money for the next half hour on someone whose idea of massage is pressing random parts like an old person typing on a computer. And it's not even about massage knowledge, someone could fake their way much better than this, these people simply don't want to bend down or exert effort. I don't expect fully qualified masseuses but why even bother with massages that are so bad.

I was the only customer in the shop and Angela greeted me with a friendly smile and said you want massage darling , I asked for medium massage to gauge her strength. The massage was ok - not what I would call sensual, until she said could she make me happier once I said yes ( was I going to say no I don’t think so) she started with sack and crack tease.

We negotiated some fun for the next 20 minutes  $20 however she would lower panties but not remove nor lie down on massage table. The handjob was ok but had a lot better, and in hindsight should have asked for Elaine based on above reviews maybe more on offer

Person's Name : Elaine

Date of Visit : December 30 2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 76A  Archer St, Inside Upstairs (Top of stairs) 8095 0266

Hours of Business :  Variable

Age : 40?

Size/shape : 10, good body

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage + RnT ..!!..!!

Value for money/recommend? : Yes (about my 6th visit)

My experience/comments : As stated i have visited this shop about 6 times that I remember, Elaine is one of the most friendly (and she is attractive) MLs I have met. This shop is upstairs in an office block and Elaine says it is a bit difficult to promote the business and do a lot of jobs. So she is not as busy as she should be as people think it is "something different" 
She also says that many shops charge too much, such as across the road, (hear!, hear!) and that many punters pay "silly tips" for massage shops when they could get more at FS shops where there is a shower.
She says it is best to call to make sure she is in ... even day before .. 8095 0266 ... !!

Today I elected to cut straight to the chase and asked Elaine to start with immediate attention to the sack and take me on a slow journey for New Year ... she laughed .. then went and closed (locked) the door !!

She straddled my lower legs whilst engaging in some light hearted conversation and set about getting me hard and then paying a lot of attention to the sack, including a few kisses and nibbles, before reverting to oiling me up for a bit of extended cock massage ...I was in no hurry ... nor was she ... and I found her a willing conspirator as to my needs, she enjoys a nipple suck (provided it is not agressive) ..oh, she was naked by now as well ... and what followed was an unco-ordinated rub, tug and fingering which got me explosively over the line ...!! There is no shower in this place which is a pity because we were both quite sweaty at conclusion.

As mentioned elswhere Elaine told me she worked last Thursday at 88A and will do so again next Tuesday where there is a shower !!!!! ..!!

Off course I will return ....!!

My experience/comments : I have only visited this shop about 3 times and this is the first time i have seen Elaine.  As others have said, she is a friendly and attractive ML.

Booked 60 mins. Good firm professional massage. The usual "turn over" followed by the usual negotiation of $25 for a handshake.

This is where it got interesting. She went and closed (locked) the door and then disappeared into one of the other rooms.

She came back after a couple of mins, stripped off, lubed herself and then shoved her lovely hoots in my face then calmly and quietly slipped a Dom over mini me and started a wicked CBJ! Wasn't expecting this!

Nice and slow and deep just as I like it and it wasn't long before the Dom was full.

More massage and then she wiped me down. Dressed and then asked her how much extra for the "other service" and she told me that part was free "because I needed it" (did I ever!).

Great lady but doesn't usually work Saturdays IIRC.

This is Gold Jerry!

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage + RnT ++

Price: $60/60 + extras very reasonably priced

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, yes....

My experience/comments : I have become a semi-regular here and I thought I should report what a great ML Elaine is. She always seems so happy to see me, always positive and gives a great service.

This day I showed up at 6pm just as Lilly was leaving. She looked me up and down and must have liked the look of me because she said she and Elaine should give me a double "and make me very excited". This sounded like fun, I must say, but I was looking forward to some time alone with Elaine, and didn't have enough cash on me. Worth considering for the future though...

As soon as we were alone, Elaine stripped off and gave me her usual great massage, only this was the first time she did it naked. When doing my back she climbed on the table and I felt her pussy gently brushing my arse and legs. Needless to say I was well ready for what happened after the 'turnover'.

Elaine lubed up the old boy while I played with her pussy, then climbed on the table, whipped out a dom and gave me a slow CBJ - it was bliss.

What happened next I will leave to the imagination, but needless to say, I was very happy with my visit to Elaine yet again.

I cannot recommend Elaine enough, for her great service, great body and great personality.

Price: $35 for 30 min plus $20 for HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : I decided to try this place for the first time, after reading glowing reviews here.  I had a bit of trouble finding it as it's not actually called Chatswood Natural Therapy, it's called something similar though on the sign in the lobby.  When I got up there it looked so legit that I thought some Chinese dude in a fake doctor smock would come out and ask if I wanted foot reflexology.  Luckily, it was different.

When I got in the room she took the $35 and I got undressed, asked her name and she said Elaine.  I had to ask her name because other members here noted that my reviews are "pointless" if I don't give a name.  So her name was Elaine, or so she says.  She has a wonderful personality which matters a lot to me.  Nice little hands with sharp nails that feel great scraping gently across my nut sack.  I told her no oil so she basically started tickling my nuts right a way.  I got up on all fours and let her play with the gear for a few minutes, then she laughed and said I was too horny when I flipped over.  She poured some oil on my cock and started working it, I asked her if she did anything else and she laughed and said maybe next time.  Well once I've got fucking a tight little masseuse on my brain, a handjob has to be pretty good to get me over the line.  So I had lots of time to try and play with her bits, she was a bit shy about it but I ended up with her shirt up and played with her little bullets, then had her pants down to mid thigh and felt her ass and pussy without fingering her or without taking her panties down.  I like that she doesn't shave her little box.

Finally I worked my cock by myself while she sucked on a nipple and played with my ass and balls.  I shot a tremendous load all over myself, which she cleaned up.  

The think I love about Chinese chicks is they have no filter on what they say.  She said I was a bit fat, but that if I lost weight I'd be very handsome.  Then she said not to worry, girls will like me because I have a 'good cock' and good control.

Will be back for sure.

Person's Name : Elaine

Date of Visit : May 2012

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 76A  Archer St, Inside Upstairs (Top of stairs) 8095 0266

Hours of Business :  Variable

Age : 40+

Size/shape : 10, good body

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage + RnT  +

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : unlike others I never have a problem booking Elaine but then I have her mobile number!

Booked 60 mins. Good firm professional massage. The usual "turn over" followed by the usual negotiation of $30 for a handshake.

Like previous visits she went and closed (locked) the door and then disappeared into one of the other rooms.

She came back after a couple of mins, stripped off, lubed herself  and allowed me access to her lovely hoots while playing with junior.  Slipped a Dom on with her mouth and started a CBJ.

Nice and slow and deep just as I like it and it wasn't long before the Dom was full. Elaine tries to prolong the experience but her slow CBJ is just too much!

More massage and then she wiped me down. Dressed and left $100 which she was pleased with.

Great lady that I enjoy seeing regularly. She and I click and I find her excellent.

 Age : 40+

 Size/shape : 10, good body

 Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

 Price : $ 50 for 45 mins, plus $20
 Value for money/recommend? : Yes

 My experience/comments : To immediately address the question above, Elaine works on Thursdays and Fridays. This was my first visit to this place, and it is tucked away nicely on the first floor... just up the stairs.. The lady introduced herself as Elaine, she indeed has a nice body, and is quite talkative as well... her English is not great, but the conversation was quite pleasant - we did understand each other ... mostly 

The massage - this was actually quite good... she found the knots in my back and shoulders, and began working on these... painful at times, but it worked... 

The tickle - during the leg massage, Elaine made sure she would "accidentally" touch the more sensitive areas between... me being a new customer, I guess she was testing the waters.. seeing if I was up for something.. and was I up for something.. and Jr was up for it as well 

Turn around time... Elaine massages the areas around Jr... and Jr was to full attention.. and without warning, she starts licking and sucking the sack.. of course, this has my full attention..  the tug became a bit harder than I like, but in a short time I was shooting past my shoulders..

A clean up, and getting dressed, Elaine brought me a glass of cold water.. and off I went, a bit lighter with a bright smile.. 

when both the sack and my wallet are a bit fuller again, I will return.

l had an appointment last friday at 3pm (a special day for me, once every year) seen Elaine 3x times before same time booked ahead for this week.
Turned up at 10 to 3pm.....she was busy ( as the week before) asked to wait, at 3-15pm was shown into room 2.....asked for 1 hour (normally take 45 mins $50)
was told only 1/2 hr possible as she had a client already in room 1....!!!

l said thanks very much and take care of your special customers and left, as much as l had hoped, it is still more about the dollars than the sense.

although a great service no wonder she is busy.........l tried Lilly across the road and had my problem licked( stamp of approval)

Value for money/recommend?: Yep 

My experience/comments:

Had heard a lot of people reccomend Elaine so was keen to try it when the chance came up. I like a bit of mystery in the air so I don't declare the type of massage I'm after right off the bat. I asked about what kind of touching she offered for me-her and her-me and she intially said not much and then completely lightened up when I revealed I was going to pay for the happy ending so it pays to let her know in advance. As an entire package it was a good experience but her massage alone wasn't as theruepeutic as I was led to believe and I was a bit dissapointed when it become clear it was going to be the typical pats on the back with some random pushing of thumbs. Love nothing more than when someone in the know gets in there and starts working the muscles. She is an attractive enough lady in the older category though with an appealing happy attitude.

Person's Name : Wendy (I tell you, I know at least 4 Wendys and 3 Amys)

Establishment : Chinese Massage

Date of Visit : 06/03/2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 76 Archer st, Chatswood NSW

Hours of Business : 10am till 7pm

Rates : $55 an hour

Age : Wendy was in her mid 40s but was still relatively taut and slim for her age

Size/shape : B cup, slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Sure!

My experience/comments :

I'd never been to this joint before but had heard and read about it. I was between appointments and had just wolfed my combination Chow Mein and was after dessert. 

The establishment was well appointed but there was only one masseuse. This was Wendy. She was warm and friendly and quick to utter the Chinese standard: "massage darling?"  

She asked me to disrobe and she politely left the room. 

Wendy's massage could have been a little stronger but she must have seen my bursting gut so she sized the situation well. After a little while and with the right amount of splaying on my part she allowed for her straying fingers to tickle my balls. It helped that I complained of lower back pain and tight glutes. Wendy knew the score and read the play well. 

Wendy was gentle for 45 minutes and then invited me to turn around. I had done a little manscaping and she was quick to run her fingers through my stylised pubes and comment on my deftness. It didn't take long before my member stood to attention, looking for action. 

Wendy asked me if I was interested in a R&T which of course I accepted. It was the standard $20 fee. She offered to strip for $50 but I talked her down to $40. This was well worth it as she left me chomp on the boobs and tickle her wet cat. Oh she loved that!

Wendy has great technique and got to know my bone quite well. In the end I blew with such force that I dented a ceiling tile. Wendy was great! Unfortunately she only works Wednesdays so I'll have to time it well. 

Worth it though!

Person's Name : April

Establishment : 76A Archer Street Chatswood

Date of Visit : Monday 27 May 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business : 10am-7pm

Rates : 35 per half + 20 for hj

Age : 28-30 maybe

Size/shape : Short, a little plump, but in a cute way. There's far worse looking ML's out there - we've all been there!

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Not bad. Good groundwork today.

My experience/comments : April is very friendly, and chatty. Maybe a little too much at times. But she's so giggly and cute that I can't be too harsh! 
Asked for a "soft" massage which is what I got. Wasn't sure about extras so asked right at the start and was told "happy ending for $20". I was feeling quite horny and the conversation took a sexual turn and it turns out she enjoys sex, but is a little shy about it, however would love to try with a westerner sometime. She said she loves to "suck big cock" but worries about a guy cumming in her mouth. I offered her an extra $30 on top of the $20 for HJ for a BBBJ whilst promising not to shoot in her mouth. She thought about it, giggled and said "next time". She also admitted to watching "X movie sometimes" but not masturbating because no one's ever shown her how to do it! 

Turn over after some minor tackle-tickle and a nice HJ followed. What I liked was that at the start of the HJ she actually asked me to instruct her on how I like it so it would be more enjoyable. Nice touch. Shot a good load and she told me to "relax right there" and went and got hot towels for the clean up. 

April also said "next time try 2 ladies for massage - much for fun". Hmmmmm... not sure it would be in here, and I only thought one girl per day worked in here, but I may think about it. I got the feeling with April that the longer and more "loyal" you become as a customer, the more you'd be able to get out of her. She did give off a very sexual vibe. Not a great looker, but cute. A bit of a gut, but nice melons which she was happy for me to touch through her top, and a little light stroking of the V-Dub bonnet outside her pants was fine by her. I didn't push it further though. 

All-in-all a delightful, although quite shy girl, but very friendly and seemed genuinely wanting me to leave with a smile on my face.

April said she works Mondays, Fridays and weekends.

I was a regular with Elaine but haven't seen here there for ages.  Last two times were as follows (sorry didn't get names because there was no choice and I was there looking for Elaine):

1.  Mid 30s Chinese, medium height, largish tits, big nipples.  Took her clothes off for $50, could suck nipples and touch but no fingering.  Finally made her bend over and jerked off on her ass, she was terrified I was going to try and stick it in I think.  She stroked my balls while I did this.  Was pretty fun all things considered.  Still reasonable value for money.

2.  The other day I went, 30s skinny tall Chinese, think she said her name was Lisa.  Tall and librarianish with glasses, she wasn't wearing a bra and let me suck/play with very nice shaped tits.  She was wearing tight jeans and wouldn't let me take them off.  Got my hand down to feel a nearly hairless box but she pulled it out again, so I didn't push it further.  Decent hand job.  Great value at $35 but wanted nude.

Will go back and hoping Elaine comes back!

Update.  Went back and got Lisa again.  $35 for 30 minutes, but she told me about 10 minutes in that I short changed her last time by not tipping (I hadn't given her a tip because there was no massage and not nude.  But she's a nice girl and let me suck on her tits for a while, and this time I got her to pull her pants down to mid thigh - she said she didn't like to be fingered - and I finished myself playing with her box while she worked my balls and ass.  Still very keen to have Elaine back to work, but Lisa isn't bad depending on what you like.  Attitude goes a long way and she seems happy enough to go straight to the nuts in the massage, which I like.  So I tipped her 10 bucks this time (that's what she asked for) and an extra 20 for last time since I felt bad.

My experience/comments :


Well having been out of Sydney for a few years i found my way down to Archer street....

Got there early hoping for one of the masseuses that have been mentioned here but got Wendy.... 

Im not a fussy guy but the massage was 5/10 at best..... for me she had no idea what she was doing....poking and prodding and wasnt relaxing at all

Time came to roll over and the tackle tickle was mediocre... mini me took a while to notice which is never a good sign....

time came for the HJ and to say she was disinterested was an understatement.. looking to the ceiling the whole time as if to say "hurry up"  ....totally non erotic and couldnt wait to leave to be honest... I have had many many RnT's and dont ever recall wanting to get out as fast as today... 


being out of town for so long is there anywhere like Natalie or Selena that a guy can go and get a goodmassage with a nice release at the end... 
I dont even care about getting the clothes off to be honest....seems from a few reviews around the chatswood area that the standard is slipping in some places.....

might have to look outside the nth shore

Hours of Business : 10am-7pm

Rates : 55 for hour + 50 tip

Age : 35-40 maybe

Size/shape : Not skinny but when stripped has curves in all the right places and looked good. Trimmed and C cup.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Very enjoyable experience.

My experience/comments :
Tina has a cuddly figures hidden under her trakkie. Oil massage progressed to mutual masturbation. Her red bra and panties didnt sty on for long as we swopped turns on the bench with the massage and the spooning. Nipple sucking and loved the look on her face when I got her going with the extended pussy play. No penetration but got two rounds off with her willing hands with my two fingers between her cheeks. A wipedown with a wet towel was welcome as we both got hot and sweaty.

She works on Fridays and I will go back.

For those who fear the departure of Elaine I can cheerfully say she was working last night. Or at least she had sent "Hello Kitty" to the Receptionist Centre to learn to type forty words per minute with Judy Suiter It was the only way! 

This is a sensible thing as Elaine realises that allowing "Hello Kitty" to answer phones without subtitles is a sure way of going broke and out of business!

Elaine still on Thursday afternoon and early evenings. A very small window of opportunity fellas. We will all need to join the this line for "Elaine" que with name tags OK? But no shaking hands fellas you never know what number punt for the day it will be!

The reference to the " Receptionist Centre " was a reference to the first styled TV ad infomercial.  "My name's Judy Suiter I went to the Receptionist centre now I can type forty words per minute. It's the only way." For all those that remember the 60's and 70's commercials. 

Pity the "Hello Kitty's" of the massage world don't bother getting a proper lesson in Engrish language skills. It is really shit when you are face down and you ask for some more pressure to be applied and they start the tackle tickle after your missive is mistaken and you bone up and blow your load early because you are too concerned to correct their actions because of being worried about your next request being misunderstood! Actually come to think of it. (Yes!) those are the moments of real joy when your words are misinterpreted for the better! lol.
Oh the joys of the language barriers. Lucky sign language is still universal!

Tell me about it. If I want my pole pulled i visit Julia or see a willing thai girl. On the Coast and Brisvegas the Asian talent thinks the bank needs feeding more than their kitties. hence the hijack of pricing. Visiting Mexico is the same. they all want big bikkies to play with pussy like its made of Platinum.
In Vic your best punts are mostly caucs. Sydney the asians have it except for the lovely Zoe and the odd privateer. But the best bets are seeing an establishment where the prices are known upfront save for extras which of course can vary greatly. Best rugup if you are going to Canbbrrrraaa. There little choice means settling for the special of the month.

Newsup alert Elaine is away on hols until August. Best ring to findout when she is back on dick. Thursday and other days will possibly be best to see her when she returns broke as. Don't ring the shop until last thursday in July.  "Hello Kitty" easily confused!

ELAINE??

Person's Name : Elaine ( hmm not sure,  as reports are that she is away but this lady said she was Elaine...)

Establishment : 76A Archer Street  Unit 6 , Chatswood

Date of Visit : Saturday 26 July 2013 

Phone:  80950 0266

Hours of Business : 10am-7pm

Rates : 35 for  half hour 

Age : 40 ? 

Size/shape : 8- 10, good shape 

Very young perky A cups with lovely responsive nipples .

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes,  will return


My experience/comments :
was shopping and figured iI need to try some more RnT shops in Chatswood.   
Thanks to the members  who have contributed to this thread, i decided that it was only Elaine I wanted to see.

Called and the lady on the phone said Elaine is available. 
I walked over  to the shop ( near the corner of Victoria and Archer which is very  busy with foot traffic)  up the stairwell to Unit 6 .

 Inside, very quiet small office. The receptionist directed me to the first room.

I asked to see Elaine for 30 minutes ( was tight schedule,  and this was my first time so didn't want to go long) .
Receptionist took the money and left me in the room.

 Small and  not a  very elegant space,  the door would not close..
notN on the wall;   "No Adult services' . Bottle of oil, tissue box and  baby powder on the small utility table. 
Not much else. No towels, shower…   just massage table.

The receptionist popped her head in and asked if I am ready for massage.. I said I am waiting for Elaine.. She said 'I am Elaine'.

Average  Asian female height, maybe 40..,  pleasant looking, was wearing a black  top and black leggings.
 Asked me what massage I like,  and I said soft and no oil but baby powder. No shower in the is shop adnd i did not want to leave well lubricated.


 I decided not to push on my usual preferences, and just relax  and enjoy bit of massage not expecting much more.

Elaine proceeded with a very gentle massage of my shoulders, back , mid section legs and feet. and sat on the  table giving me a very nice massage of my bum and  thighs with very delicate featherlike strokes.

Her technique was  excellent, and I was stirring and awakening  from my flaccidity.

After about 15 minutes Elaine  asked me to roll over on my back.
She started started a very gentle massage of  my stomach and  torso and around  my balls and gently stroking me and moving  her hands to my inner thighs and  continuing  this pattern. I  was caressing her back and  shoulders and slid my  hand under her shirt  to  touch her skin and gently massaged her back. .  Elaine murmured an approval and  pulled off her shirt and bra for a thirty dollar tip.   I sat up and  massaged her gently, kissed her neck and she put her head back so I could have better access to her breasts. Small yet very firm and perky for her age,  I nibbled and kissed them, caressed her  waist and  bum  sliding my hand in her tights with mixed success. 

She acknowledged that the massage was  nice and I suggested to go longer next time and give her a soft sexy massage. She giggled and continued the arousing massage I had rudely interrupted..
This continued for  several minutes, Elaine stroking and caressing my erect sausage..  and applying oil for what was to be a sensuous  slow tug which culminated in a splendid eruption of man juices ricocheting off  Elaine's breasts…  Hmmmm ...  very nice release,  and I am quite content.

 Elaine mops up and we chat a bit as I get dressed. Her English is not that strong and I am not sure what exactly was agreed to.

Overall a nice quite session with Elaine ( or the lady referring to herself as Elaine if  Elaine was actually away).

 Well done... or well conned?!
				
Post Content: 
Well WAK... were you conned...? Difficult to say!

Personally, I haven't seen Elaine for quite a while so not sure how she is these days. Elements of your story fit well but seems these days she is pretty sensitive to new clients and somewhat paranoid about Council snooping (probably justified given early reports!).

My guess is, it was Elaine... partly because another staffer trying to pass off as Elaine would soon come unstuck. But also, the MO was pretty much Elaine first time.

Quite simple... you'll have to go back and push the boundaries. Book for a different time slot and see who you get and see what happens!

I stopped going here because the other MLs were not in the same league as Elaine - who became hard to book - and there's no shower for what was usually a very oily/damp experience! She worked briefly in Artarmon (with shower) but that didn't last.

Others may comment with more current intel... however, I suspect the 3 wise monkeys live here...hehehe...! 

Good report... but maybe more research required to satisfy your curiosity!

Keep going back with hopes of Elaine but this time it was Amy.  Think I had her before but memory is only good if it gets sloppy on the table.

She takes her time with a relaxing soft massage, then worked slowly to the tackle tickle before asking me to flip while hinting HJ costs extra.  Her technique is excellent and unrushed, but she won't allow touching inside her bra, and wouldn't take any gear off.  She did let me rub her pussy through her tights.

As with all punts I wanted her to strip and suck my cock but the technique was the day-saver in this punt.  I like a slow teasing tug with nails scraping across the nut sack, and she's good at that bit.  She's also very pleasant and doesn't crap on about negotiating how much for what or making a big deal out of moving my hands out of her bra.  She just smiles and gently redirects.

Dropped in here yesterday and met Nancy, a very tidy young lady.

Anyway, she provided an awesome massage, probably in the top five ever.

Nancy knows what a hard massage is, she has left bruises and nearly broke me in half.  That was a great start, then came the tug,....FMD!!!

Zoe of Lane Cove is the only lady I know who does the "your thighs over her thighs thing".  Well Nancy did it with me lying face down and then with me face up.

Cock worship for a good ten minutes, it was fantastic.

When we ran out of time, she propyl put a boob in my face and a hand in her loose running shorts.

Finished me up, gave me a head massage and a wipe down with about three hot towels.

Also tells me that she only works Sat and Sun, and that the business has changed hands.

Cheers 


Chalk



Fantastic.

$40 for the 30 min massage, $20 for the finish for the finish.

Person's Name : Lisa

Establishment : 76A Archer Street Unit 6 , Chatswood

Date of Visit : April 13 

Phone: 80950 0266

Hours of Business : 10am-7pm

Rates : $60 per hour + $20 HJ

Age : LATE 30s?

Size/shape : 8- 10, thin and tall for Chinese gal, short black hair. 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, will be back

I was in the area and dropped in without an appointment looking for Nancy. I wasn't expecting much given that I hadn't booked and unless I was the Duke of Windsor no one was ever going to drag anyone out on my saying so. So I settled for Lisa without fuss. 

Lisa is no spring chicken but she's tidy and tall for a Chinese gal. Her massage is competent with the right amount of pressure to iron out the kinks. There's also a hint of TT to keep you honest. In short , I quite enjoyed Lisa. What I didn't like was that there were toey punters calling and dropping by unannounced like me which made for a few interruptions. But this is not Lisa's fault. Oddly enough, I was offered to have 2 girls in the one session which would have impacted on the human resources even more though this is certainly an option to consider on a future visit. 

Upon turnover, Lisa gave me a cheeky smile and the deal was done with a nod and a smile. On her part, Lisa knows what to do with a hard cock in her hands and seems to enjoy her work. This makes the experience all the more enjoyable and my hands started to wander. What they found was that Lisa wasn't wearing a bra and didn't mind a grope. She has nice big tits and let me have a right grope and pop them out from time to time. I loved her big brown nipples and wanted to take chunks off them. 

In the end I blew over my right shoulder and past the wicket keeper. Lisa's almond eyes opened like dinner plates in delight and commented on the turbo-charged shot. I was saving that for Nancy, so I guess I'll do an Arnie and will be back! Lisa used hot towels to clean me up and I left with a spring in my step. 

Very enjoyable Sunday arvo session away from rain. 

Lisa works weekends. 


Happy punting!

Time before I had Nancy, who did the thighs over thighs thing above, plus put a rubber band around my nuts and shaft for an interesting tug.  Should have got her clothes off as she looked alright.  So I went back today and got this really really large girl, very nice, got most of her gear off and I sucked on her enormous tits while she did a decent HJ.  Nothing special and felt kind of dirty afterward.  Want to get Nancy again.

You will not get Nancy pants off, top and the B's out yes, but not pants.

I've gone off her, I dropped in last Sunday and she came out of the right hand room and as the door opened I could see someone else was in there, when I asked, she said it was her boy friend.

I do not feel like getting my dick pulled when her boyfriend is two cubicles over.

Also I think I have explored all the options with Nancy, great girl but I think our time has run its course.

This was the culmination of several days back pain and a quest for relief around 'Rub N Tug Central". On a whim, I climbed the stairs yesterday having not been here since Elaine was a fixture. I was greeted by Nancy, who put me in a room saying she had a booking soon but would start me off until her client arrived and the other girl returned from a break. All good... she is very efficient and business-like. Paid for an hour, stripped and she returns with the change.

We chat a bit, during which I mention Elaine which seemed to provoke considerable animated dialogue from Nancy, most of which escaped me in translation. Suffice to say, Elaine's name appeared less than popular. Maybe too many requests for special 'Elaine-type favours'... 

Nancy inquired as to my skeletal issues before commencing a murderous routine. Actually, I don't know how "routine" it was... if most clients are getting this treatment, she may kill as many as she cures...! She actually WALKED her way up and down my whole body. From ankles and legs, all the way up to the shoulders and back again. Now Nancy is a well-built woman with all her bumps in the right places... very strong... FMD, it was torture... but I must admit now, quite therapeutic... although should I return for her treatment, I'd have to request a more gentle regime!

After around 15 minutes, Lisa enters the room... lots of chat between them before Nancy retreats to her booking after assuring me that Lisa would look after me... . From my face-down repose, I greet Lisa by name and you'd have thought I was a long-lost favoured lover... I look up and she clearly believes she recognizes me and begins a discussion about WTF...??!!!!. I play along, considering that an old regular will get the royal treatment! However, we soon develop a more silent atmosphere for the massage. I do believe however, that I've seen Lisa somewhere around the traps long, long ago. She is distinctly tall and slim with a wide toothy smile.

Her massage is very proficient. She works all areas with extra attention to the low-back problem until eventually settling in on the crack, sack and tackle... lovely!  It's not too long before I am obliged by simple physics to turn over... Lisa ensures I'm comfortable with a head pillow before conducting an indeed royal massage performance on the bean-stalk... complimenting with a somewhat stereotypical "Mmm, nice big cock"... accompanied by a devious toothy grin! I reciprocate with some targeted stroking of her torso, sliding a roaming paw under her loose-fitting top to find a lovely pair of soft natural puppies... delightfully un-restrained by any brassiere. She seems to enjoy the attention. A few minutes later and there's wrigglers everywhere... 

Lisa cleans up and then continues with further massage to my arms torso and thighs. We chat quite a bit... her English is excellent. She is apparently divorced and with her school-age daughter, lives in Chatswood, hinting at a desire to find a "boyfriend"... which I assume explains the probing questions as to my personal circumstances!!! There is also a little discussion about the virtues of "working at home"... about which I might ponder as some possibility of extra-curricular after-hours attention...??! An opening for a bright young man perhaps...??!!!

Lisa clearly has every intention of providing me with a full hour so that I end up with over 1 ¼ hours of treatment all up... she extracts a usual $20 tip from my change. She purposefully informs me that she works Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday here, reminding me of the phone number on the shop bus card. She also works at Beecroft and I see there are reviews for her on the Hannah St thread.

So, a very pleasant and proficient lady... a great tug... but I'd be surprised if much more would be on offer. At some point however, I will test this... before she forgets me...

Last time I went I got Nancy again, she is actually very skilled at therapeutic massage and she worked out some serious issues I had.  She did work out the final issue but didn't want to get the pups out - I get the feeling she's more keen to do legit massage than what was normally on offer at this shop.  Long live Elaine wish I knew where she went.

Lisa provided her usual good value, a reasonable massage, lots of TT and HJ with access all areas.

One of the things I like about her is she never wears a bra which provides great access to a set of very playable boobs.

Unshaven, but quickly moist (dripping sometimes) generally heralds a quick clean up.

She is husband hunting, but the quality does not drop when you make it clear you are only a customer.

I went there just to check things out since Elaine left. Found Nancy there. So I thought I give it a go.

Nancy does a very good job of massage.  I think she must have been train properly. as she work out I had
a shoulder problem. I ask for a medium hard massage. This was my mistake . It was so hard that
my back was hurting 3 days later. She said that it was good for me to sort out my back issues as well.

Out of all the years of massage. This is the most painful I ever had.
Quite cheerful personality. But was not interested in providing the tug part.

So all I got was the massage which was one of the best.

I will probably go back only if I needed a good massage workout.
I know Nancy work on Saturday and Sunday.

Haha... Now I realize why Lisa has seemed familiar the last few recent times I've seen her. I first saw her as Alice at North Star way back in 2008. From memory, she was husband hunting back then! Nice willing lady though

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Went to check this place on a Friday midday and it was my mistake for not making a booking. The place was busy and, as I had other business in Chatswood, I agreed to come back in 1 hr. To my surprise there was a middle age woman sitting in the waiting room; waiting for her hubby or massage?

I came back in one hour and was handed over to a Chinese woman around 50 years and was told she was the only available and that she does good massage. 

She took me to a small room and tried to ask in broken English how long I want to stay for. Just as well there was a piece of paper with prices stuck on the wall so I pointed out to 1 hr and handed over $60.
I also asked for a hard massage but was not sure whether she could understand me. 

Nevertheless I stripped and was ready for a hard massage. And hard it was indeed; I had to ask her a couple times to ease off a bit as it was hurting like hell. On the other hand she quickly found my tight spots in my upper and lower back and was working on them a lot. She did the same with my legs using mainly hands and elbows but in the end she jumped on the table and walked on my legs and lower back as well. 

After the massage I found, to my astonishment, that there were no bars at the ceiling for her to keep balance. Not bad for an older woman to be able to balance her body with no support whilst doing massage.

She was using a thin small piece of cloth covering me whilst massaging me. She did not use much oil as she was concentrating on my problems areas constantly asking - sore? 

On the turn over she covered my middle section and started massaging my stomach and chest which resulted in "little kerim" having a nice erection lifting that thin piece of cloth on my stomach. She looked at it and touch it saying no time, time over, etc. I had a problem with it and used a standard key to obtain vital service - a promise of a $20 tip.  Suddenly time was not an issue anymore and she applied a fair bit of oil and proceeded to stroke my cock. 

As much as I enjoyed the massage, even painful, the HJ was exactly opposite. Quick, mechanical strokes, no sensuality in it at all. Just as well I managed to come. 

So massage - yes, HJ - no.

My experience/comments :

Lisa has been reviewed in the last few months at length by more experienced punters so I will just add my few comments.

Massage - reasonably good, worked on my tight spots over and over again, lots of hand and elbow work, dry massage and oil massage in use. Not much t&t during the massage. Turn over and continuation of massage of my front combined with sensual touching in the right areas. Overall not too bad. The only problem was that she was on her own and had to answer telephone calls; just as well there were only two or three calls at the beginning of the session. 

HE - again not too bad, a bit of play and sensitive touching, copious amounts of oil, no problem with being touched down there and she appeared to enjoy it judging by a rather wet but hairy pussy. Did not play with her puppies this time but will try next time. From the previous reviews it is really worth it.

In my HO worth another visit. Lisa is there on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

My experience/comments :

Following my previous visit I managed to see Lisa the following week - 10/02. This time I rang and make a booking and just as well because on my arrival I found Lisa to be on her own and overwhelmed with phone calls and punters. I had to wait a few minutes and was not so keen to do it in the little waiting room, which is hardly private, so I opted for a quick visit to "Gents". It took me a few casual minutes and it was enough to hear the bottom door shut after the previous punter left the shop.

Lisa was waiting already with the room prepared and was apologetic about being late as the other girl did not turned up for work. She had another booking already organised and I was a bit worry about the timing but she said it was OK so we settled for one hour.

This time the massage was better as I asked her to concentrate on the areas that required manipulation to undo all the knots. Good elbow work was followed by her walking on my back and it did manage to loosen up my back. Down to the floor and oil was applied all over with plenty of TT. That was a good finish of a good massage. Once her hands started working on the crack and the inner tights I needed her help to release the old fellow from being squashed under my stomach. 

She took it as my wish for a HJ from the back but I had something else in my mind. So I indicated to her that i wanted to turn over and to play with her mammaries.

As reviewed before that was easy and enjoyable with no distraction of a bra. She has nice and playable tits with responsive nipples standing to attention very quickly. They may not be very big but still quite nice to touch and caress. As before she had no problem to be touched down below and, with the help of a g-string, it was easy. Once again she got quickly wet but this time I could not hold for much longer and she got me over the line. Her play from the back with my jewellery and cock made me hot.

Usual hot towel followed and I managed to exit the place without seeing another scheduled punter sitting in the waiting room.

In summary this was a better punt then the first one so worth another visit to ensure the standard stays the same and further improves.

As before she reminded me she is there on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

One has to ask is there more than massage and HJ?

Almost certainly not. Well, unless you want a relationship with her... she has been boyfriend hunting (maybe husband hunting!) for a while. Great massage and tug though. A really nice lady... one could do a lot worse. She has a young daughter.

My experience/comments :

My visit No. 3 to Archer St. Made a call to book 1 hr and just as well. Lisa answered the call and told me she was busy and to come a bit later (45 mins) which I did. 

Once again she was on her own and busy answering the phone. Not a good sign but I persevered with the arrangement. I managed to relax a bit and was enjoying her competent massage but the phone kept ringing. Eventually she brought into the room and the bloody thing kept emitting some kind of signal for a few minutes. I suspected it was saying in electronic language "my battery is flat, put me on a charger".

A couple punters wandered in to be told " I am on my own, please come back later". 

The latter part of the massage was a bit better, the phone stopped ringing, and I managed to relax a bit. So I was enjoying her massage kind of half asleep when she started playing with my crack and also offering sensual TT. This brought the little kerim to be more alert and standing up to attention so Lisa started playing with him from the back. She kind of took me by surprise and the enjoyment of it caused a much quicker reaction than I expected. 

I remember a few years ago CiCi (?) at Vital was a master of this kind of play but she departed back to MLC a while ago. So it was nice to go back to some unexpected but very pleasant ending.

Would I visit the shop again? Probably not unless they change the staffing levels. I tried it late morning, lunchtime and mid afternoon as staffing seams to be a problem. And as Hard warned me I am not looking for relationship.

My experience/comments :

I rang on Monday and made a booking for Lisa for early Tues as she only works Tue and Thu and is busy.

She is quite tall and does the walking on the back and a reasonable massage.

Her HJ is pretty good and she allows touching and doesn't wear a bra. She also allowed me to play with her pussy a little on the outside which helped get me over the line.

As stated earlier she was on her own and busy answering the phone which is a bit annoying. Thanks, whomever rang on the vinegar stroke - at least she kept up the good work and ignored the phone this once.

A someone came in early on but was sent away for the hour.

She didn't grill me about marital status but then again she towers over me and I have a few years on her so I must not be her type. I think she is attractive but I have read differing opinions - she is a nice person and so that counts for a lot with me.

My experience/comments :

I visited Lisa a few times in the last six months and provided detailed reviews so only a few additional comments this time.

I booked Lisa for late Thursday afternoon (last visit before closing time) and this time there was another girl working so the session was much better because there were fewer phone calls and no people coming from the street. I did see the other girl briefly after the session at the end of their work but did not asked for her name or her work days. She was maybe mid 20s, Chinese with a reasonable English fluency as I could hear her talking through the paper thin walls.

Lisa offered as usual a competent massage with lots of knee walking on my back. As a matter of fact she probably spent most of her time trying to fix my back. This was followed by a very nice tt, crack play and dick play from the back. On the turn over I discovered that not only her tits were freely available for my enjoyment but also she was wearing a g-s which hardly covered her pussy. And after a short play she was wet very quickly. I did play with her pussy on the outside only and as she was so wet this brought me to a quick end. 

After the usual clean up and during me dressing up an interrogation session commenced. This is what Hard was talking about in one of his early comments.  The questions were very subtle but being armed with the knowledge and experience of Hard I knew right away what she was fishing for. Innocent questions like "who is going to cook dinner for you tonight" and "do you like Chinese food" put me on alert.

So thanks Hard for your warnings.

My experience/comments : 

Late one afternoon I had to go a locksmith in Archer St. I parked in Westfield and took a short cut to the shop. Exiting the locksmith's shop I look at the familiar building across the road and thought I have not visited it for a while. For family reasons I have been recently rather busy and absent from punting. So I decided to give Lisa a call, but to my disappointment I left my phone in the car. So I decided to try my luck and walk in to see whether she was available.

I claimed the stairs and got inside and noticed some changes; the set up was a bit different and an unknown Chinese lady told me she was the new manageress (and I assume an owner). I asked for Lisa and was told she was busy but if I would like to wait a bit Lisa should be free soon.

Whilst waiting in the back room I noticed more changes inside. The was a small hand basin/vanity installed in the corner of the room with waste and water pipes running about 1 m above the floor around the room. That was very recent job and the new installation wasn't working as yet. I must say the pipes looked ugly and I hope they would enclose them somehow. Hooks for clothing disappeared and were replaced by a basket to fold your clothing into. Not necessarily my preferred way to store my clothes. New prints appeared on the wall as well but the sign with timing/prices was still there.

My room inspection was interrupted by the manageress who told me that Lisa might be busy a bit longer and that she would start my massage. 

She told me her name was CiCi (?) and that she did massage courses here in Australia and she believes she provides good massage (obviously) as she has more than 10 years of experience. She spoke a reasonable English and her massage was OK albeit short and being interrupted by our conversation. She is about mid 30s not too skinny but not too big. I did not have a good look at her expecting Lisa but would try to check her out later on.

Shortly after Lisa appeared and continued massaging me. She seemed to be happy to see me. Not much more to add to this part except that her boobs where available as usual and this time she allowed me to play with her rather wet pussy. This brought me over the line rather quickly.

Lisa told me that she was unsure and rather apprehensive about the changes and not sure whether she would stay/have a job in this place. She gave me her mobile number in case she wasn't there anymore.

On the way out Cici gave me a business card with a new phone No (mobile) and $10 discount card for my next visit. I will try to find the card and post the number.

P.S. Recently I tried the landline number associated with this business; it was ringing but no answer.

This place is easy to find on near the intersection of Archer street and Victoria Avenue in Chatswood. From the street you go up one flight of stairs and it's basically right there in front of you. Inside, the room I had was not fully enclosed however the lights were really dim and music was playing so it felt really private.

When I went in the massage lady was sitting behind a desk to the left. I think she is pretty good looking with a great body. Awesome legs being shown off to the full as she was wearing a very small skirt.

I thought this was kinda strange but there was no oil involved in the massage. It was 95% elbow and a bit of using her hands to "walk" up and down my back. I have to be honest and say overall I didn't really enjoy this. I think using the elbows is awesome as it feels like the muscles are being "released" somehow, but elbows for the whole massage? It actually got painful towards the end as the same spots were being pushed over and over again. It's feels like I didn't really get a massage, more like a muscle probing.

Again I have to be honest about part 2 as well it wasn't really that great, or not my style I guess. First of all there was no TT. Secondly, her technique was the "machine gun" style where they go really fast. I guess some guys are into this because I've come across a lot of ML who do it but I don't enjoy it at all. It became kind of embarrasing because I started losing the boner half way through because it was too rough and to combat this she decided to go even harder. I had to slow her down and this lead to the strangest orgasm I've ever had as I came semi erect.

Do you guys think this was Lisa? 

I feel like the physical description matches i.e. tall and slim, but the service seems to be quite different to what others have had. We connected well in terms of conversation and she seemed really nice which also matches what I've read about Lisa in here.

Does the lady have a big toothy smile? If so, quite probably Lisa. She is slim and tall with prominent teeth... but that style of massage doesn't sound like Lisa.

Lisa usually doesn't wear a bra under her top and is quite happy to engage her delightful natural bosom in proceedings

Hmm, maybe it wasn't Lisa then. I didn't really notice any prominent teeth lol. I know I described her as slim and tall in my previous post but I guess now that I think about it she wasn't exactly slim, as in skinny. She wasn't fat or large by any means but she was tall and proportionately sized. So annoyed I couldn't understand her name I literally had her repeat it two times and I just couldn't understand so let it go.

edit: forgot to mention in the review that there were heaps of interuptions during the session with people coming to the door and her leaving the room for random stuff like checking a phone and messing around with the stereo. At one point she put on the theme to mission impossible which was kinda random lol.

tl/dr: FlyBoy spends an hour with 'Lilly', gets the rub (which was very good) but not the tug (which really sucked) (no, not that type of sucking).

Yep, I lucked out. How much bad luck do you have to have, to go to what's an established rub'n'tug place and not get the tug, to have the ML decline saying she doesn't do it? Maybe that'll teach me for turning up wearing dressed-for-the-office clothes, if they thought I was a council inspector or something!

Anyway, it could also be the universe balancing itself, after all those fantastic sessions with Elaine back when she opened this place some years ago.

So here's the story: found myself visiting a client in Chatswood today, figured I'd visit one of the local places and put a little money back into the Asian ML economy. Was in the mood for a decent-ish massage plus tug but also the option to have the lady strip down a bit, so as I was a block from 76A, decided to pay a call.

(Thought of dropping in to Linda's next to Chatswood Chase but as a rule the ladies there don't doff the top.)

Walked in, mamasan behind the desk and two ladies at the front - short Chinese with short hair, average looks and build; taller slim Chinese with long dark hair and somewhat toothy; didn't care which one I was assigned, as I figured they'd both be good at the rub and the tug (and while the shorter one, Lily, was a bit older, maybe late 30s or early 40s, anybody with familiarity with these places knows that these women can still do great work).

Into the room, opted for 60 minute massage and told $60, handed over $50+$10 for the $60 plus another $20, said "That's your tip" with a smile. Lily was confused - massage is only $60, why did I give her $20 more? That should have been a warning bell of sorts! I said "it's your tip" but she still didn't get it, was handing it back to me, so I took it back and figured I'd pay her later.

Lily starts in on a very good massage: back, shoulders, legs. Then punter in the next room starts to complain about something, I can hear 'his' ML and Mamasan exchanging comments, I'm not sure what's going on but then Mamasan calls out to Lily, and after a few words she leans down to me and says "I leave now, another girl come in for massage." Didn't even give me a choice, which p*ssed me off a bit, although I figured maybe she was going next door to give the punter his happy ending, but who knows?

Anyway, in comes tall slim slightly toothy one, we swap names, she is 'Lisa' and starts massage on my legs. Very different massage, softer and more long strokes, not a 'real' massage but I don't mind, although the switch has sort of blown the mood a bit for me, and I find myself wishing that Lily would have done the happy ending bit as I quite liked her.

Well, be careful what you wish for. In a few minutes I hear Mamasan and Llly talking and then, bang, Lily is back in the room and Lisa leaves. Well, whatever, I'm okay with this if it means Lily is going to get into the fun part of the deal, as I do like her way with her hands and her shape is nice and I could certainly go for a reveal of those boobs.

Except that it doesn't happen. Nothing happens. She gets me to turn over, I can see from the clock on the wall that we've got 10 minutes left and I think "Well she's cutting it fine but maybe I get an extra 5 for the interruption and switcheroo, anyway let's focus on the good bit now".

But no, Lily draps me with a long thin sheet, works on legs, FlyBoy Jnr is up in no time and making his presence known through the sheet, but no response from her. She's by my side, massaging a thigh, so I nudge the sheet down and guide her hand towards FBJnr but she withdraws it, "Sorry, do not do."

WTF?

I mean, WTF?

Okay, I mention the obligatory "extra money" to her but she's apologetic, doesn't do. Finishes massage and says time's up, makes mention of my coming back to see her, I ask if the other girl can come in for "extra massage" but she doesn't understand, so f*ck it, I'm out of there. It was a great massage but lack of happy ending, grrrr.

Coming back here, I read that 'Lisa' is indeed the one to get for fun, so I definitely lucked out! Oh well!

Must have been the day for it FlyBoy... but yes Lisa does a very tidy hand shandy 

Yesterday, I attended a thusfar un-reviewed Chatswood shop in the Gallery arcade... 6B/445 Victoria Ave, just off the pedestrian mall. They are pretty new and advertising quite a bit at the moment on BP and the NST.

tl;dr : Nice firm massage, almost too firm, but effective. So much so, I actually extended to 90mins - mostly in the vain hope of getting the tug! Interestingly, she was also a Lilly! But alas, that place is legit. No point in a review

Haha, I'm always on the lookout for new places and you'd think that odds favour a massage place in Chatwood leaning towards the rub+tug formula, unless it looks massively mega-legit. Maybe things will change once the shop's been open for a while and they realise the ladies need scope for 'extras' to make ends meet, or indeed to attract ML staff in the first place.

That's the thing, and as I've noted before - perhaps to ad nauseum levels for Sparksy and others - Natalie at Tiandi remains a bit of a 'gold standard' along with a few others, when it comes to what I like, which is a good massage plus a great tug and extras on the table (or sometimes up against the table, heh heh heh).

I know I can go to many places for the full raunch, bodyslide and upsell to FS or even FS being part of the deal. There was a time when that was my primary interest - Mina at Albany (and her best ladies) stands out for this - and sometimes that's still the case. But more often these days I want the massage, the touch, the relaxing, then the tease and the tug and a few other options which may be available (and may or may not be taken up, depending on the lady and my mood).

Anyway, I might head back to 76A for the Lisa treatment next time I'm in the area...

    Prices: $40/30 $60/60 + RNT extras

    Age: late 20s early 30s

    Size/shape: size 10, tall for a Thai 5"7 5"8

    Nationality or Ethnicity:Thai

    Services:Good massage i guess

    Value for money/recommend?:NO, dont think i will ever go back, I would recommend everyone to steer clear

    My experience/comments: 

This shop has turned into a Thai joint except you dont get an inclusive service like the one at Katherine does.
Was lurking around Archer street, tempted to visit Sundance as the recent reviews suggested younger MLs, which when i turned out a ladies in her 50s showed up and the other busy.
So I thought id check out across the road, and a lady? named Cherry was available, always had a thing for tall girls, she? was reasonably tall as a Thai, probably 5"7 ~8.
Generally not a fan of Thai ladies but she is from the Chiang Mai region so not as tanned as the typical Thais. Decided to take a punt with her? as these days it is rare to see a tall asian ML.

How fucking wrong was I. The second she stepped into the room, she looked like a man to me somehow but i wasnt too suspicious at first as I recall a feminine face during the intro. I really hope someone could clarify and tell me otherwise if they have had a session with her?
Once the massage started, i didnt think much but indulged in the massage because it was actually quite a decent one. As i was told to flip over, this is where the thought of a post-op has come into my mind.

So first, i noticed her voice was quite deep and NOT feminine.
I gave her the benefit of doubts as the weather was up and down and she sounded like she caught a cold. I asked her if she was sick just to convince myself and she said she was.
It was tough trying to convince myself that.

Secondly, she has very manly hands and feet, not just big, i know taller girls are natural to have big hands and feet but it didnt feel right for me, they werent just big, whilst i liked big feet, they were just manly to me!

Thirdly, she started moaning whilst jerking me off, and it really sounded like a man for some fucking reason. She started asking me to "touch me here" then grabbed my hand on her boobs in a deep voice.

One point i would make though, is that i noticed she had very smooth skins, like I wont believe any man on earth would have it that smooth.
Having no knowledge nor interest in tranny, i dunno whether there is some kind of operation you could do to your skin or some men are just born to have extremely smooth skin.
However, when she was sitting on the massage table wanking me off, her frame was a give away of a man's frame, wide shoulders, and just the body lines arent feminine at all.
I wish i was wrong.

24 hours from it, im still furious on the experience. Not only on this alleagedly post-op ML, BUT the level of hygiene at this shop was appalling.
Towards the end of the massage, she bought in two HOT towels, it was actually quite fucking hot.
After wiping all the oil, and she wiped my inner thighs, rather close to my cock and balls. And i was a bit cautious, until she rolled my foreskin and wiped my dickhead with the towel!
I told her not to immediately, and despite my immediate effort, she managed to made contact with my dickhead with the towel. Now im fucking hoping i wont catch any shit from it.
Then i realised the room had NO tissues, only wet baby wipes but she never attempted to use it at all!!
The whole experience was disgusting in terms of hygiene and the image of an alleged post op wanking me with her big and manly hands is still in my head.

If anyone has had any info or experience, please do let me know, feel freel to send me a perosnal message if needed.
Would be very keen and glad to be proven wrong.

Interesting to hear this place has gone Thai. Just what Chatswood needs... more Thai shops  And hey, Jordan, what's not to like about Thai ladies... the most fun lying down!!!

However, chillax mate. Maybe you need to get out a bit more... spread your wings... be adventurous! Paranoia is not your friend in the punting business. I'm saying that in the nicest way as mate to mate 

It does sound a bit like Cherry could be a LB. But so what... if it was a good tug, mission accomplished. If she didn't get her kit off, how would you know if she's post-op? Holy fuck, maybe there was a dick lurking there 

Plenty of Thai (and other Asian) guys have very smooth skin. It's a gene thing... and you certainly couldn't determine gender on skin texture. 

As for infection risk... you'd have to be ridiculously unlucky if not impossible to "catch any shit" from that session. Many places use a microwave to heat the damp towels... no bugs there... and that shop has always been clean when I've been there.

Relax my friend... I'd be sure you're still pure as driven snow

Probably thought with the wrong head, as tall MLs in chatswood is getting rare, it wasnt until she sat face to face with me, so close that I was certain she was a he...
At the end i didnt finish, the idea of a man jerking me off, and her manly hands did put me off. Paid her the extra and ran for my life.
If she really was, im absolutely disgusted with how they run their business! Hygiene is also another big concern!

Cheers hard, kind words like yours do brighten my day.
In terms of Thais, just a personal preference haha, typically Thais dont have well looked after feet, and im a huge fan of feet LOL Turns me off if i see a pair of not so good looking feet.
For that reason, I always preferred Viets, Chinese, Japs and especially Koreans!! However, Koreans are rare gems in Chatswood these days, and its really where I could visit during work hours LOL

Although recently I significantly reduced my punts due to work commitments, im always keen to see new blood

Hey Jordan... if it's tall girls you like, see if Chinese Lisa is still in this same shop. She's all woman I assure you... tall, does a splendid tug and you can play with her epic rack all you like. At least until recently, she was working Tuesdays and Thursdays here. Otherwise, as Sparksy said earlier on this thread, you can find her at St Leonards.

But if it's gone all Thai, then maybe she's not here... but ask and you may receive

I was there today,  review to follow. Reception/Mamasan was Chinese,  the girl who camein to massage was Thai.

So maybe a hybrid of employment going on as with 44 Hampden . They have Viets, Chinese, Korean,  French !  etc.
Maybe the Chinese are wising up that a few Thais on the roster is good for business.

A new World order happening in Sydney!

Was in Chatswood and decided to get a massage.

Not really thinking  of any extras as I was a bit tired ( after a binge on the weekend review to come) and a massage would be quite sufficient. On Archer St  noticed that shop, went up to the first level. 

Greeted by the friendly receptionist, we agreed on 45 minutes massage. She was Chinese ( Milf)  and I sense runs the place.

Clean and tidy shop. A couple of rooms.  Keeps it all looking legit. 

They offer pregnancy massage… 

Unfortunately,  no shower,  which usually keeps me away from some shops

Mamasan had me strip, and  very quickly returned with warm towels for a one over .

Soon she was back and started to work on my body and after five minutes told me another girl will come in as she had a regular custom arriving in 10 minutes.

On the ten minute mark,  a young lass named ‘Gypsy’ form Thailand popped in. 

Tight short black dress,  and the fact she was Thai suddenly had my dirty brain perk up a bit. 

Gypsy was proceeding with a fine medium massage. We chatted quite a bit about her life etc, 

Nice gentle massage on my upper biody, nothing spectacular but fine .

When she started working my buttocks with some fine attention and casual caressing my inner thighs (not skipping a few slides over my tackle) I became more interested in the remainder of the session. I was allowed to caress her  leg and lower thigh and coerced her in allowing me to massage her for the last 15 minutes. 

I tried to extend more,  but another customer was booked in.

Gypsy wiped me down,  and I was off the table in a nano second. Standing in my birthday suit, and Little Wak at half mast, young 

Gypsy was not shying away from his curiosity. .

She did not ask for any extras when I asked her to take of her clothes. 

She was soon on the table, and I spent about ten minutes massaging her fine slim body.  

Nice peachy bum received even more attention.  Turned her over,  and she was quite content with a  soft  gentle breast massage,  and  my caressing her abdomen and  light massaging  of her prominent shaved mound. 

Time was against me,  and Gypsy subtlety had  my cock in her hand as I was massaging her soft  breasts.  Overall I administered a demo massage, and Gypsy said she would be happy for another  longer one.  I promised I’ll  be back and book more time so she can enjoy my service.

She changed places and I laid down. She oiled up the old fellah.  Came closer to me allowing for my hands to explore  her  young body, under carriage and caress her fine bum.

It didn’t take long as her hand work is quite skilled. The little beasts were squirting our of the fountain in frenetic fashion. 

Time up,  Gypsy had to scoot ,  gave me a little hug and a Thai thanks when I handed over a tip for her kind and calm service.

Reception came back in and wiped me down,  as there still was excess oil.

We chatted and she said I should book ahead so next time I would have more time. Nice gentle touching form her assured me this was one establishment I would be happy to frequent.

Overall nice experience. No time wasted. 

Cons: No Shower.

Of course the experience is in the realm of YMMV.

Cheers

Wak

This shop has, gone my limited experience, gone downhill from its first two incarnations: the first being Elaine, who was amazing, and the second being a new mamasan who definitely wanted to make this the new go-to place in Chatswood. Now it seems to be more Thai than anything else, and to be honest I don't have the greatest track record with Thai MLs. I've read the reports of some amazing ones at Artarmon, and must get myself organised to head there sometime, but for now I've got some regular clients at Chatswood and was hoping to find a regular lady in the immediate area so as to to suit my schedule. But it won't be this one.

The ML: Thai, 30s, name was 'Min' or similar, looks a bit hot and that was a promising start

The rub: okay, it went downhill from here. Very average massage. Letting the Thai team down!

The tub: no decent tickle-tackle before hand, and on the flip it was all very mechanical, to the point where I really didn't "get into it" at all.

The cost: $50 for 45 minutes, $20 for the tug.

Yes, a short and sweet review, but my search continues....!

Person's Name : Nancy

 Establishment : (Chatswood) Massage Suite 6 LEVEL 1 76 ARCHER ST

 Tel: 02 8095 0266

 Date of Visit : Sunday, 8th October 2017

 Hours of Business : 10am - 7pm 

 Rates : $40 for 30 Minutes

 Age : 25 

 Size/shape : Slim size 6, light skin, pleasant features, nice soft B cups 

 Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

 Services Provided : Massage, Topless HJ

 Value for money/recommend? : Ummm, not going back for her

Looking for a RNT and was heading over to Neridah Square to do the rounds and dropped in here.

Saw pretty Nancy in a very revealing bath robe creation and was taken.

Got her into the room and stripped off the robe to reveal a nice set of B Cups supported with probably a couple of KG's extra.  Got her topless and she started straight with a HJ, told me that the painters were in and that she had to leave her knickers on, and then that this made her boobs sensitive and that I could not play much with her nipples.

Told me it was extra $$$ to suck them.

Anyway all we did was the HJ, she is a very skilled girl and was good company, but a little money hungry, extras for this and extra for that, killed the mood.

Anyway, one thing led to another and the tadpoles were released so all good.

She wanted $50 but I countered that she was not nude and that it was extra to kiss her tits, I offered $35, she offered $40, I offered $30 and she agreed on $35.

So a nice enough girl, but she is a little too "Commercial" to maintain the vibe.

Cheers

Comments:

Been walking past this place for ages and had some time to kill so went in. Was met by Monica and thought YUM you look nice and went into the first room. The room was pretty small but clean and tidy. The walls don't go all the way so some of you noisy buggers will need to keep the moaning down. Saw a sign on the wall "No Sex Please don't ask", mmm that is not always the case. I only had limited time so handed over the cash for 30 minutes and Monica left and I stripped leaving my clothes in the box provided. As I was climbing back onto the bed Monica knocked and opened the door seeing me in all my glory. She apologised profusely and I said no problems and thought it an excellent time to broach the subject in a whispered voice about extras - the usual $20 / $50 options and I choose the later. She started the massage and it is pretty crap, no real technique and thought the way she was going she may do damage - pretty strong girl. I wont go into the massage to much - really crap - other than to say that after 15 minutes of this she left to go and get the hot towels. She returned and as she was mopping up the limited oil that she had used, she told me that I was her second customer of the day - it was around 3.30 in the arvo - bloody slow if you ask me. After the mop up she started the light feather touches and a bit of TT - needs a bit of practice here as it was that erotic. I suggested that I turn over and she get her kit off, she strips to reveal a young Chinese body with probably A cups with nice nipples and a trimmed pussy - nice. 

She starts to oil the old fella and I must say that this is better than some that go straight at it and just bash away, Monica was totally unrushed and not to worried about the time it seemed. My hands start to wander and it is tits and bum only, well at least at the beginning. She later told many men just paw at her pussy roughly and she doesn't like that - gentle is definitely the way with her. So I gently stroke her body as she is gently stroking my cock and his mates. We go like this for a few minutes and my hands wander a little bit south and start to just move around her pussy lightly, which she seemed to like as she said that it was OK to continue. More minutes pass in this unrushed tug and I realise that we are going to go over time as I do not feel like cumming just yet and she is still going at a slow unrushed pace - feels nice. I ask is I can see her pussy and she says sure and climbs up onto the bed into a 69 position, oh my Monica has a pussy that I would love to devour, just perfect. Would also like to play hide the sausage with her as well . I again slowly stroke around her pussy without actually touching her to much - keeping within her boundaries - and she returns to the slow tug. A few more minutes of this and she slow increases the pace of the tug and I know that it is time to blow the goo. I give a couple of instructions to ensure that I blow and she follows them to a T and it isn't much longer before I am blowing a massive wad of man goo everywhere. She cleans me up with a pile of wet ones and tissues and I get dressed and leave. On the way out the mamasan said something like 30 minutes only to her or something and she said not busy not a problem. I offered to pay the extra for the time as I didn't want Monica to get into trouble, but was denied by both so hopefully it worked out OK.

Monica is a student and only works here on a Tuesday and no where else. I think she is a little young but with a little seasoning would turn into a lot of fun. Will see what happens next time as I offered to massage her when we were getting dressed and she seemed to think it was a good idea.

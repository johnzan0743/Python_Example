 Chinese Massage - 6/47 Neridah Street  - 0420 792 977
				
Post Content: 
Hi Guys

Today I was walking through that rabbit warren in Chatswood at Neridah Street and stumbled across this little gem. Its a new shop on the ground level sorry not sure of the shop number, its got Therepudic Massage and Facial stuck on the window in a purple colour. Anyway it looks genuine so I thought I would wander in a check it out. I was greeted by a small chinese girl named Selena that siad she was the manager of this new shop. It looked  a 50 50 proposition that I would be  happy but I thought in the name of research I would take one for the team, God knows we really need another R/T joint in Chatswood.

Lady Selena
Age 30 something
Size small with a few nice curves 
Cost $35 for 30mins $60 for 60 mins

Well I was lead into one of the 2 small rooms which a new and nice and very clean and smell nice and asked fo 30 mins. I handed over $50 and took off my clothes. When Selena returned and gave me the change I placed it at the end on the room on a ledge thinking you never know but not holding out much hope of anything more than a massage.
What followed was a fantastically competent massage from a lady obviously properly trained in the art. After about 15 mins  was almost drifting off when she hitched up the little white nurses uniform and climbed on top of my back. Feeling her pussy and thigh muscles grind into my ass suggested more was to come. Those famous words turnover and without asking a little light rubbing and when I made the right sounds she went straight for Mr Ed. $20 was negotiated and a highly competent happy ending followed. This lady knows how to perform this artform and takes pride in her work with thee right amount of pressure and speed and knows not to stop immediately after takeoff. The usual cleanup and hot towel a little headd massage and out the door in 40 mins (she is not a clock watcher)

Looks 7/10 needs some work on the teeth
Body 7/10 from what I could see
Massage 8/10
HJ 9/10 fucking fantastic 

Would I return shit yes and I suspect extra's may be on offer. Punters give her a go and keep us all posted on any additional offerings.....Ah the thrill of the chase!

It's not the recently-revamped 29A, which is upstairs and is run by Jenny (and Jenny doesn't get into that level of activity) - but in a recent visit to 29A (report coming) I did notice at least two other massage places on the ground or 'street' level and did in fact wonder about them, so it could easily be one of those. Nice to know there's yet another option in Neridah for us, alongside 29A and North Star (43)!

Open to 3am..? Now we're cooking! That's in the same league as Chequers, Oriana etc... very odd for a location like Neridah, which is not only out of the way (off the main drag of Chatswood and nothing nearby) but is also a shop tucked away within Neridah itself.

Also, according to that site, 1/47 is part of a 'chain' which includes 62 Erskine St in the CBD and 287 Broadway, Glebe..? I don't know about Glebe, but recall there were at least two places in Erskine Street which were part of a chain - I had the feeling that The Red Lantern in Crows Nest was part of such an arrangement, maybe that's the 'other' Erskine St place? We might need someone with more knowledge of Erskine St to help us out here.

Anyway, I am definitely going to put 1/47 on my list of places to suss out as soon as the opportunity arises  but if anyone here has that chance before me, don't wait around, drop in and let us all know how 1/47 shapes up.

When today, didn't see Selena, bit there was another massage going on next booth.

Lady I saw wanted $35/30, Attractive late 30's really nice build. But clearly new at the game, tried but was removed from the task at hand. Feeling outside wasn't denied, more just ignored. Wore loose jeans and nylon knit top.

The HJ would be 5/10, probably much better looking than Selena, but not naughty enough for me. Maybe I'll book her next time.

Any one know the close time?

Jim.

On Erskine St, there is Sirs (number 80), a place called City Touch - I think number 70. I believe this number 70 place is the shop associated with the Red Lantern. Maybe 62 is yet another place.

Okay, I ended up in the vicinity of Chatswood this evening so decided to swing past Neridah Square to suss this out.

Alas, the 'open to 3am' bit appears to apply only to the two city branches of Tang Massage (see http://tangmassage.com.au/prices.html).

The shop at Unit 1 (which is actually on Neridah Street, not inside the complex as are all the other massage places here) was closed - a sign on the door listed opening times as the disappointingly normal and almost legit-sounding 9am to 5pm weekdays and 9am to 3pm Saturday (well, it actually says '9-5' and '9-3' respectively, but this place was all shut up at 10pm and I'm guessing they don't mean 9am to 5am weekdays!).

Speaking of legit, the menu on the window certainly carries that theme through - listed treatments include waxing, tinting, facials (not that sort of facial!) and 'wedding services'.

None the less, we of course welcome any reports from AXR members who are willing to take a chance on a new place rather than just follow the decidedly non-Trek option of "going where other AXR punters have gone before".

Agreed - that and the relatively early closing hours mitigate against it being our kind of place. It's one thing when there's a list of massage treatments and sessions - the sort you see at Albany, 29A Neridah, Tiandi and so many other such places - but all that waxing and tinting looks too 'clean' for me!

Interesting is the inclusion of 88a Hampden Rd Artarmon in this "Tangs" chain. The ads for 88a in the NST have stopped, after moving from "adult services" to "massage services" and the phone no. has changed. I assume a change of ownership. Hmmm... I was enjoying intermittent forays into young Ivy at 88a - bit of a shame if the place has gone more legit. I need to investigate.

Person's Name: Wendy

Hours of Business: Works at 6/47 Neridah on Wednesday and Friday

Prices: Standard $60 for 60 minute massage plus extra for the tug. I hopefully paid $30 up front but suggest $20 is more appropriate - well, no, in fact I suggest you save your $20-$30 and not see Wendy at all.

Age: Early 30s

Size/shape: Tall, medium build, a little curvy but in that nice Chinese way, certainly not chubby

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese. That's rather unusual, because most Asian massage parlours in Chatswood tend to employ women from Scotland...

Services: Good rub, lousy tug

Value for money/recommend?: No and no,


When last we chatted, dear reader, FlyBoy was back hitting the gym 5-6 times a week and experiencing that same familiar rush of endorphins and testosterone as always kicks in and for the few first weeks makes him more than a little 'keyed up' in the bedroom department, resulting in a somewhat higher-than-average number of visits to rub'n'tug places (it also increases the frequency of his winking at, flirting with and chatting up cute young Asian ladies, which is never a bad thing!).

That initial surge having passed, I'm now back to the rub'n'tug as a once-a-week treat. And this week's session was supposed to be a treat indeed - I've hit 10 visits at 29a Neridah, which under their customer loyalty program gives me a free massage session, and 29A has also just this week opened its 'VIP treatment room' replete with a shower and more space (I'm hoping there is also a larger table or even bed-type thing, a la the old 'penthouse' room in Albany!)  so on my last visit to 29A, the somewhat MILFy manager Jenny promised she personally would give me that massage (well, probably because it means none of her ladies lose out on the income from a non-revenue session) and with a teasing wink said that she would take good care of me.

Based on our previous in-room interactions I'm of course curious, but that curiosity must go unsated for now, as when I rang to make my appointment for this afternoon - yes, a little 'afternoon delight' instead of an evening booking, the joys of working for oneself! - I was told that Jenny had taken a few days off, would not be back until after the weekend. A 'Julie' was on deck, but I haven't seen her and so wasn't sure if she was a tug girl, a no-tug girl or a boring-crappy-tug girl (and I think that last one is the worst of those last two evils). Plus, Jenny had with her the key to the VIP room, robbing me of the chance to try it out with one of the 29A ladies on Saturday or Sunday who are very-good-tug-and-extras girls (May and Yuki among them).

Having read good reports of 6/47's Selena, however, I figured that would be a good option - always nice to try somewhere new and someone new, the reports piqued my interest, and I can always do 29A and Jenny at the end of next week.

So to 6/47 I headed. This is in the same middle area of the Neridah Square complex as 29A - in fact, when you see the sidewalk sign for 29A, that's where you turn in for 6, except that instead of going all the way to the end of the courtyard and up the stairs to 29A, #6 is directly to your left on the street level shortly after you walk into the square. Look for the large windows with  painted purple artwork.

I wander in, to be met by an attractive-ish, easy on the eye early 30s (?) woman who tells me her name is Wendy.

Well, we'd heard that manager Selena was looking for staff  seems she has already found some or is at least conducting try-outs! The first room is closed and I can hear it's occupied, so as Selena is clearly busy I decide to see how Wendy stacks up. Maybe she matches Selena's apparently very good level of service, maybe she even goes a little beyond (as the 'staff' are often wont to do, compared to the owner/manager), but I figure at worst I'll take one for the team.

And hey, team: I took one. You owe me!

I've got only $50s and $20s in the wallet, so when Wendy asks for payment up front I decide that rather than pay for the massage and then have to bother with discussing extras mid-massage, I'll pay her a fifty and two twenties up front - so that's $90, being $60 for the one-hour massage and the rest I tell her is her tip, as I smile and gently fold her warm hands around the notes. She smiles back, she knows the deal and I now think "Goody" on two counts:
1. I don't have to do another 'money before honey' talk, no haggling over $20 or $30
2. She's getting $30 instead of what IMHO is the more standard $20, so that might get me a little extra leeway, especially as she's new here and knows she has a chance of scoring me as a regular if she looks after me

Of course, I bombed on the second point there.

Wendy does a good massage, no complaints at all. She starts with a head massage, which is quite excellent, then a brief ear massage (!), then neck, shoulders and works her way down. It's all with just hands, sometimes through the towel, but it's so relaxing that it doesn't twig until a bit later that she's not used any oil.

That's the first third of the massage; then she sorta repeats it, but this time with a little oil (but using a generic-brand 'baby oil' rather than a proper massage oil, which is a mark against this place in my book). No tackle tickle at all, not even a hint. That's also when I for some reason recall that unlike Selena's little white health worker skirt, which allows Selena to nicely rub her way along a clients' back, Wendy is wearing street clothes - a thin red top and a pair of thin light jeans. So I'm now thinking that a Selena-style rub's not gonna happen, in fact I wonder what will happen?

That's answered when, after the hot wet towel wipe-down, Wendy asks me to turn over, which I do (being an obedient lad who listens to what a lady says) - and then she starts a little soft stroking over the chest and playing with my nipples, tweaking them a bit... now that's never done a lot for me, but I get into the spirit of the thing by suggesting that I return the favour, gently rubbing my hand from over the curve of her jeans-clad backside to her waist and then up her tum towards her breasts. Nope, that's not really on, as she part-swivels away and also moves her nipple-tweaking arm so as to prevent my access. I complement her breasts, asks if she might take her top off - no, she doesn't do that. Doesn't even suggest it might cost extra, it's just not on the menu.

Well, fair enough, that's not a deal-breaker (although it's most always nice)... but what doesn't do it for me is her tug technique. After a dollop of oil hits the happy stick, one hand continues to tweak my nipples while the other pumps the pole... there's the odd bit of sackplay but really, Wendy's just not into this, and while she smiles a little warmly and cheekily when she looks at me, when she's not doing that she has this bored distant "I wonder what's on TV tonight?" look, clearly the tug is just a 'necessary evil' in this service for her.

I'm not saying she should LOVE tugging blokes, but at the very least one likes a lady who can fake it, to look like she's into it or even that it's pleasing her that she is pleasing the guy - ideally of course she will seem delightfully into it, which was the case with Mina's Albany ladies (on the relatively few instances when they did a tug!).

But no, Wendy's not giving any such indications, with so little enthusiasm and technique that I contemplate making this a no-show session - but then I realise I'll probably hit another local place to empty the sack later that same arvo or on the next day, so I may as well get my $50+$30 worth and shoot the stuff. Job done, Wendy cleans me up and I spend the last five minutes getting another head massage.

So, for those tempted to visit Selena at 9/47 Neridah - you'd better call to make an appointment, because when she was the only one working there she was the only one you'd get, but now there's a chance you will walk in and find her busy but another lady lying in wait.

For what it's worth, when I left the room Selena was finished with her client and sitting behind the reception desk - and yes, I will definitely return to see her, as Selena gives off a certain vibe which FlyBoy's rub'n'tug radar detector all too readily picks up. She's much more my cup of Chinese tea!

A great review FLYBOY, Selena is a nice Chinese MILF and underneath her little Nurses Uniform she generally wears matching Bra & Undies, although she is not that well endowed, she does have great suckable Nipples.....I like your style, go straight in a lay the cash down and ask for a sexy massage upfront....when I go to Billy's I pay him $50 and he gives me $5 change, once in the room I lay the $5 down on the table with another $50 and the WL knows what I am after....I'll have to go back and see Selena soon but there is so may new RnTs the SeaRay has to chaeck out first.................

Being in this fabled neck of the woods, I ventured into 6/47 Neridah and was warmly welcomed by the lovely owner and manager, Selena.  As described in previous posts, Selena is an attractive lady but also has that hard to describe demeanour, partly cheeky, partly playful and very much suggestive.  Being from Shanghai, this lady is certainly not short on confidence either.   Legend has it that the most beautiful women in all of China come from Shanghai, and I must admit they are certainly attractive, but in my experience the most beautiful women come from further north, from places like Harbin, where they might have a Michelle Yeoh type of charm and physical beauty.

During the course of a relaxing massage, another punter entered the premises and took up residence in the next room whilst waiting for Selena's new lady to arrive.  One drawback here is that the walls don't reach the ceiling and noise does of course travel.  Also somewhat unnerving is the knowledge that not only the adjacent tenant but any ladies-in-waiting might be eavesdropping to pick up on any conversation or other utterances.

Anyway, the highlight of the massage was when Selena's new lady arrived to be told that her custmoner was already in the room lying naked on the bed.  Upon entering the room, the lady was heard to say "Massage?"  which is when Selena and I started to lose it.  I can only imagine the possible responses running through the poor chap's head, such as "Oh, sorry I thought this was the local chess club?"  or "I just wanted to borrow a library book?".  Anyway, Selena and I had a good laugh thinking up several more variations on the theme and amazingly, it must have been only five minutes later that certain unmistakeable noises started to emanate from the adjoining room (apparently the poor guy had been checkmated in five moves or less).

Anyway, back to Selena's massage, it was very good and the quality massage oils and creams used made it very pleasant.  Although extra were offered, due to some other issues going on in my life, I politely declined.  If you're reading this Selena, and contrary to what Lily Allen might have you believe, "its not you, its me!".  A good massage, although there were frequent interruptions and the privacy could be better.  Suggest a return visit when things are a bit quieter.

After a visit yesterday afternoon you can put FlyBoy down as another convert to Selena's, indeed to Selena herself!

I've been before but happened to bump into the same offsider, twice in fact, named Wendy, and each time she was very average and not to be recommended. Average massage, average but not-at-all-into-it tug. Let's face it, any lady named Wendy is already starting from just a little behind the line because her name conjures up memories of the Wendy from Albany, and of course nobody but the Wendy herself could ever match up. 

But Wendy of 6/47  or 6a/47, if you go by the sign on the window and want to get anal (ooh, yes please!)  is one to skip. If you ever walk into Selena's and a lady named Wendy is on deck, do yourself a favour and walk right out again. Head along and up the stairs to 29A where Jenny keeps a stable of generally pretty good ladies, and if you're lucky then Mia or Alice, especially Alice, will be on deck (I think Alice is Saturdays only, but she is a corker).

But if you wander into 6A and Selena is available, you're really lucky... or you've been smart and called ahead and booked, because she gets pretty busy, especially in the late afternoons through to closing time. And for the next week she's going to be even busier, because the recent rains and a tree-rooted underground pipe combined forces to flood half of the shop, so the carpet's been ripped up from everywhere but the massage room nearest the window, so there's only one massage room available.

Fortunately, both Selena and that room were available to help clean my blocked pipes.

Here's what you need to know.

The lady: Selena's great. Mid-late 30s and while not a head-turner she's still appealing in her own way, sorta like the original Wendy or Mina etc  a great smile, a great manner, good English for chatting and joking back and forth. Not slim, has a little extra padding around the tum and waist which is always fine by me (although nice shapely legs). In other words, on the FlyBoy scale she is MILFy. If you want some early 20s Asian hottie then seek your fortune elsewhere (probably Oriana or whatever it's now called, up on the other side of Chatswood railway line at 7 Help St). Ditto if you want massive extras beyond the tug. That's not Selena's game. 

The rub: One of the best. Right up there Natalie at Tiandi, Jenny at 29A and Linda at Vital (just to keep things localised to the Chatswood area), except that Selena goes more in for the manipulation and pressure to really get those kinks out. If you want softer just say so, it'll still be a first-rate massage. If you like a real massage before the happy ending then Selena is, as I say, up there with the best in my book.

The tug: Also excellent. Again, right up there with Natalie but in my book even sexier because Selena seems a bit more 'playful'. As Selena starts to give you the massage, from the head of the table and alone the sides, be sure to give her legs a little gentle stroking and attention so she knows that you're 100% up for the tug.

The cost: $60 for an hour is well worth it, as is a $20 tip for the tug.

Remedial Mind & Body Chatswood, 6/47 Neridah St, Chatswood, 0420 792 977

Person's Name: Nancy

Hours of Business: not sure

Prices: Standard $35/30 plus $20 extra for the tug.

Age: Early 30s

Size/shape: Tall lady, not real pretty but has a nice smile which always wins me over

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: RnT

Value for money/recommend?: Yes


Was in the neighborhood of Chatswood after work and decided to check out Tang's in Nerediah. But wasn't sure about the exact address, as I never seem to be organised enough to take all the details with me when I go somewhere, I wondered around the many tiny shops in Chatswood Village. Whoever thought of this place was either brilliant or stone-raving mad but lets not go there. 

I didn't really think too much when I opened the door at 6 (or is it 6a) and walked in. Still sort of thinking this was Tang's, but soon realising it wasn't. Here was a very friendly lady in nurse outfit (I assume this was the fabled Selena) welcoming me in. This place has got a nice feel to it, not sure what it is, but it is good. 

I get ushered into one of the little rooms. Very cozy with nice soft (purple/pink colored) light and some trinklets on shelves at the end. I am a tall person and here (as with all Chinese RnT places) my feet stick out way too far off the table. Oh well, nothing I'm not used to. In comes Nancy, tall, not pretty but pleasant and a nice smile.

She gives me a nice massage and takes care of all the bits that need taking care off. I ask for Medium and I get Medium! Excellent, so often they don't listen and hack away at me as if I'm a lump of dry dough that needs to fit in a baking tin that is way too small. I get offered a tug but have to decline as I'm saving up for something else but all in all a good experience. Friendly staff and would defnitely come back some time.

Place		7/10 (I like the lights and the trinklets)
Massage	        7/10 (good but not excellent - listens to your wishes)
Looks           6/10 (and an extra point for the smile)
Recommended	not sure, as I think ymmv

Avaya: yeah, the shelves on those little massage rooms are a bit funny with all their trinkets and tat (especially the room closest to the outside and Neridah Square itself).

Great to hear you got a good lady apart from Selena - my experiences (twice, although with the same woman, 'Wendy') made me less keen to try offsiders and sharpened my resolve to sample Selena, and I'm glad I did!

6/47 Neridah St, Chatswood, 0420 792 977
Person's Name: Monica (maybe new, but good)
Price: Paid $35/30 plus $20 extra for the tug.
Age: Mid 20s
Size/shape: About 5'2" v attractive, didn't ask for clothes off, in fact didn't touch her at all so can't really comment.
Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese - although a hint of Indian look about her?
Services: RnT
Value for money/recommend?: Yes/yes.

Was "Xmas shopping" and the pain of it all demanded I bought myself a quick-time tug. My 1st visit here - had tried at 29a but Jenny and the girls were very busy. Here at #6, I presume it was Selena behind the desk and who took the next client after me. I got young Monica. Tiny room - barely room to get the kit off and for the girl to get around the table. But yes, the right music and the trinkets are a relaxing touch.

Anyway - a v good rub (I did have a bloody sore back which she somehow seemed to fix) and v proficient tug - I made a mess... A longer visit would probably be more "satisfying" but I was in a hurry LOL

Yes, sorry - this is a lazy, short review but it is the (fucking) silly season. Or is that the silly fucking season?

I'm a great fan of the Thai girls @ Thai Artarmon & Lindfield & after reading the good reviews of Selena, thought I'd try her massage yesterday.

Must agree with other punters that having experience with Selena herself is indeed a great way to finish the week on a Friday afternoon.

Very friendly & chatty (having lived in China myself for sometime made conversation even better) & looks ok.

Her back & leg massage is actually really good on knotted muscles & when the magic words "turn over please" are voiced is when Selena truly shows her excellent skills in RNT.

The technique from her small, oily hands & her smile throughout shows she enjoys her skill & is willing for the punter to enjoy as well.

There was a younger Chinese girl at the desk who was easy on the eye & if her boss has taught her the same skills she would be worth a punt also!

Will return & I hope other punters will enjoy.

Vail 6a/47 Neridah. I am sad to announce this place is now closed, I did speak with Selina some time ago when she intimated this would happen, well it has. Shut and everything removed from the premises. She told me the shop might sell coffee beans or something like that, but the old business was finished. .. The Passing Parade ..!!

That is very sad news! Selena was always a safe bet when it came to "real" massage plus enthusiastic ending. Anybody knows where she is off to? Maybe working somewhere else?

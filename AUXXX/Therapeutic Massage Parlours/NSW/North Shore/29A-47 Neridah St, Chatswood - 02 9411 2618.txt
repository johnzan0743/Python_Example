My first review I visited this place last Friday 6pm I cant remember the girls name (late 20's say bcup). Was there for the hour started off with the normal massage $50 with a little tickling between legs however nothing special. Time to turnover and then the extras were offered FS +$50 was on the menu but others were still around so would have to wait 30mins until they left I could not as was off for dinner with friends and just got HJ $20 to finish. I would visit again but maybe a bit later to see whether the FS was really on the menu

 Massage 29A - 19/07/09 - Lin, 29A/47 Neridah Street Chatswood 0410 384 291
				
Post Content: 
A cheap little place, $30 for 30 min and $50 for an hour.

Good massage, OK tug (extra $20), it is a curtained off office set up with one or two girls working.

The girls are OK looking, small breasts mid 30, not dressed for play.

The standard sort of back massage, with the gentle caressing starting before the turn over to finish off.

I have seen two girls there, a tall skinny girl, with a pocked marked face, very mechanical, however the massage and caressing was OK, did not go for any boob action as she did not really have any.

Other girl short but more boob, was quite happy for me to play with them as she finished me off.

OK place for variety, however no real deep connection.

 Massage 29A - 7/09/09 - Candi, 29A/47 Neridah Street Chatswood 0410 384 291
				
Post Content: 
Well, I had that need again, that need for a good old fashion massage, a massage by someone who knew what they were doing and who would look after me.

So no "trials", no "punts", no "taking one for the team", I needed Miss Reliable. NOTE: NOT Mr Reliable.

If I was going to get rubbed, it was going to be done by someone with Tits, not Dicks.

So off to 29a I went, now you will of read the previous reviews, the Asian massage place at the back of 43 Neridah Ave Chatswood, it is a rabbit warren in there, but down the back of this little burrow is #29a.

I knocked on the door to be greeted by "Candi", now for you assiduous readers, you will of noted in the forums the various tell tail signs of a Massage girl who will go the extra distance, in my case about 6 inches extra.

Candi, was attractive of face, with a pleasant smile (nice enough, but not that important as I'll be face down for a lot of what I planned), but more importantly, she was dressed showing to best advantage the assets that her parents and the Target Lingerie department could give her.

A nice set of tits sticking out of a low cut top convinced me that this massage parlour could ease the tension from my whole body.

In for a hour for $50, started the usual massage, nice and firm, shoulders, back, legs, neck, arms and head, then my favourite four words "you want hand job?".

"Yes", I reply. So without turning over, Candi, is starting the soft massage on crack, back and sack, plenty of pressure and caressing back of the sack, all quite delightful.

Then the turn over, she starts of the old fella with good reliable pressure and frequency, we are all responding to this, it is great, I decide to sit up and slip Candi's top and bra strap off her shoulder and grab hold of the nicely sized bcup boob.

All good, Candi says $10 extra to take top off, but I was reaching that certain point in the process, where short of the Misses or the local Police entering I did not want anything to stop the process.

So, with left hand on boob and right hand on her arse, I finished off quite happily.

Relaxed for the hot towel rub down, and frankly, that is not to be under rated, that is quite a nice experience.

Had my head massaged again and I was at peace with the world. 

Paid my extra $20 for the HJ and left on time.

Very happy with Candi's work, highly recommended.

P.S. Her massage is not the hardest I've ever had, but she does know how to get the kinks out .

THE NEW 29A NERIDAH STREET

Give it a go, well worth the effort. Fully fitted out with new rooms and immaculate with a new owner the very lovely Jenny. I am sure results may vary but I think you will find what you are looking for if you get the right employee. Anyway massage is generally very good and surroundings are first class with everything brand new, so nothing really lost if no luck as the massage will be worth it......happy punting

Funny you should ask sparkes6...

Here are the details from the business card they gave me:

Northshore Oriental Health Centre
9419 2227
Mon - Fri 10am-7pm
Sat-Sun 10am-6pm

Was in the area this evening...intended to give Tiaini a go but they were booked out, so decided to try this place remembering that it had previously received positive reviews here.

As sparksy mentioned in his review, it appears that this place has now been refitted. Proper rooms, sinks in each room, very clean in appearance.

The downside...prices have gone up...$40 for 30 mins, $65 for 1hr.

I went for the 1hr option with a lovely looking chinese girl named Linda. Slim, a-cups, and at a guess around 30 yo (I would rate her looks 7.5/10). Tried to strike a conversation with her without success.

Linda was wearing a short pink nurses style outfit, with black tights underneath.

Average oil massage which was mainly focused on my back & shoulders. No leg massage, and the neck and head massage was rather 'feathery'.

After approx 40 mins she asked "would you like a hand job darling?". As it would have been rude to say no...I accepted. $20 extra was the damage.

A pretty good HJ followed, which was a good thing considering the 1hr massage & HJ cost me $85 which is above the odds for this neck of the woods. Linda did offer to take her clothes off for another $50, but as most of my fellow punters would have, I declined. She did however let me have a great feel upstairs and downstairs through her clothes to help me over the line.

Would I go back? No, as there is better value for money around.

NB: The business card has the details of what I gather is another site of theirs (or perhaps it is now closed??):

Firstly, great review, thanks for posting this, I remember when this shop was far more dodgy, curtains and FS on offer.

The new pricing regime may price them out of the market, especially if the services are only average.

There is another massage place in this complex, shop 43 opposite the food shop, that may be worth a try.

As for 108 Penshurst, I have seen it, but never been in it, it has never appeared in any reviews or discussions.

We will all see.

BAB, well done and thanks for the contribution to the threads.

Cheers

 29A 47 Neridah Street Chatswood 27/07/2010 - COCO
				
Post Content: 
Hi guys

Saw Coco for the 2 nd time at this newly renovated shop.

Name Coco
Age 30+
Chinese
Body Slim
Tits AAA- this girl has nipples only
Pussy A little hairy but very tight

2nd time this girl was very responsive. Straight into GFE kissing and cuddling and had the clothes off without me asking in 2 minutes. Plenty of feeling all over including inside that pussy which is very tight for a finger but I bet would feel great for a cock. Started to lick her on the tummy and then went to pussy/groin area and boy does this girl love DATY. After a 4 course meal and plenty of finger action she came at least twice whist never stopping on the hand action on my cock. Plenty of GFE feeling and after her turn it was mine with some oil on the old fella and a very nice tug.

$35 for 30mins (ask them to put you in the book for $5 discount and every 11th visit free) + $30 tip for the extra's as I was running low on funds but she seemed happy enough with.

treat her nice and I am sure she will respond as when I mentioned FS she replied "one day" WTF!!

Happy punting

 Northshore Oriental Health Centre - 29A/47 Neridah Street, Chatswood (ph 9419 2227)
				
Post Content: 
Just a quick but update on the 'new' 29A at Neridah Square.

* Now trading as Northshore Oriental Health Centre, this opened a few months ago as a renovation from the old 'cheap but cheerful' Asian rub'n'tug'n'more place. It's a massive improvement compared to the dodgy decor of the old 29A - two massage rooms with proper (if somewhat thin) walls, a small basin in each for the hot water towels, good massage oils - a real investment has been made. This place is actually a sister joint to 6/108 Penshurst Street, Willoughby (see reviews here), and run by the same Jenny (who works at 29A Monday, Wednesday and Friday).

* Prices are $60 for 45 minutes and $75 for 60 minutes. A health-care rebate is apparently available and after ten visits you get a free massage plus $10 off the hourly rate from then onwards (so $65 instead of $75). Hours are 10am to 7pm Monday to Friday, and 10am to 6pm weekends.

* Like 6/108, the new 29A is very legit-looking, but extras are on offer depending who you see, although you may need to book for the hour and give a little hint or some subtle physical cues rather than just lying there and waiting to see what happens. I've had two girls do the tug for free, a third for $20, and a fourth did tug+strip+boob'n'bum play for $40 all up.

* Keen to take the new 29A for a trot and see how it shapes up? They're having a "Father's Day" special this weekend, all massages are 30% off. In my experience (reviews to come soon, I promise!) the massages are in the range of 'good' to 'very good'.

 Northshore Oriental Health Centre - 29A/47 Neridah Street, Chatswood (ph 9419 2227)
				
Post Content: 
Establishment: Northshore Oriental Health Centre

Contact Details/Address: 29A Neridah Square, 47 Neridah Street, Chatswood (ph 9419 2227). For those who aren't familiar with the location of 29A in its former incarnation as as somewhat down-market rub'n'tug place - Neridah Square is a dark brown rabbit warren complex of offices halfway up Neridah Street, between Victoria  Street (opposite the entrance to Chatswood Chase car park) and Albert Street.
29A is in the middle or 'central' part of the complex, down past a row of car park spots and up a flight of stairs. There's usually a sandwichboard sign for this place out on Neridah Street near the most appropriate entrance.

Hours of Business: Wekdays, 10am-7pm; weekends, 10am-6pm. Those tend to be closing times rather than 'last appointment' times depending on the lady or ladies working, so if you definitely want to get in, head there an hour before.

Prices: $60 for 45 minutes and $75 for 60 minutes. Yes, those are above the norm for this area and a rub'n'tug, when you consider that most places do $60 for the full hour. However,  a health-care rebate is apparently available, so that sweetens the deal a bit. There's also a 'frequent visitor' plan - ten visits you get a free one hour massage and then onwards, $10 off the hourly rate (so $65 instead of $75).  a health-care rebate is apparently available and 

Services: Naturally this depends on the girl but in my experience the massage is always good (7/10 to 8/10, and closer to 9/10 if it's the boss Jenny); most times there's a tug on offer (if you have any doubts, try to give the lady a hint during the massage or earlier). For some ladies the tug is part of the standard rate; others will charge an extra $20. Some will also kit off for an extra $20-$30 with a bodyslide included.

Value for money/recommend?: If you like a decent massage in a decent shop, complete with how wet towels to clean you up and some tug+extra action, give the new 29A a try. But know in advance that you'll be paying above the card compared to other places in the area, so if you're on a budget then look elsewhere.

Other notes: This renovation from the old 'cheap but cheerful' Asian rub'n'tug'n'more place at 29A sports two massage rooms with proper (if somewhat thin) walls, a small basin in each for the hot water towels, and good massage oils - a real investment has been made.

This place is actually a sister joint to 6/108 Penshurst Street, Willoughby and run by the same Jenny (who usually works at 29A Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and Penshurst St on the other days, but she moves between them depending on demand).

Name: Yuki
Age: Late 20s/ Early 30s; quite attractive and easy on the eye
Size/shape: Medium height, slim-medium build with a little pleasing curve
Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese
Services: Strip, tit'n'clit play and bodyslide for $30 extra
Value for money/recommend?: Yes!

I've seen Yuki just once at 29A but she'd be on my books to see again. As soon as the mamasan told me that had a 'Yuki' on that day my ears went up (along with another part of my anatomy) - it's been to long since I enjoyed the delights of a Japanese girl, even though I thought it odd that this Chinese shop would have a j-girl on the books.

Turns out that Yuki is Chinese but spent some time working in in Japan (Osaka), where she used the name 'Yuki'. Her English isn't much chop so most of our very simple chit-chat was done using my rusty Japanese.

But I was there for the massage and more, rather than conversation. Yuki delivered on both counts - a good and relaxing massage with a mix of muscle manipulation and circular pressure, and every now and then a little diversion into the nether regions of inner thigh, crack and sack. That she was wearing one of those Albany-style nurses' uniforms was another indication that pleasing extras were on offer.

Once we moved into the tug and I turned over, Yuki was happy to shed that uniform along with her bra and panties and after some exploration of my own, she jumped on for a bodyslide to finish me of. That was a very happy ending indeed.

Name: Jenny
Age: Late 30s/ early 40; appealing and MILF-worthy
Size/shape: Medium height, slim-medium build with a little pleasing curve
Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese
Services: Happy ending after my second visit with her, because she says she doesn't offer it to all customers...
Value for money/recommend?: If you get the happy ending, yes.

I always like to get a session or two with the owner or manager of any Asian massage place - well, on the basis that they are female, have a good attitude and look good, and especially if they are MILFs. Mina from Albany and Natalie at Tiandi tick all those boxes, and Jenny at 29A does alright for herself as well. It makes for some interesting chat and insight into the business, which all helps develop a bit more of a rapport with the lady, and that makes return visits nice for the friendly smile, the familiarity and sometimes the availability of extras (or extra extras).

My first session with Jenny proved that she knows her massage - it's one of the best I've had at a rub'n'tug place. But despite this being an hour-long booking here was no tug on offer. Maybe that's because the place had just opened up the first time I visited and saw Jenny - they were literally two weeks' new - so perhaps she was steering a safe path, trying not to make the new 29A seem too much like the old 29A (where everything through to FS was available, depending on the girl). And maybe also that I was a first-time visitor to this place and to her.

My second session with Jenny came after I'd seen some other girls in the interim - Jenny had been at the front desk and chosen a lady for me, and she'd marked my name up in their 'frequent customer' book with other visit - so maybe by this stage she knew I was cool with it all. So towards the end of our one hour booking she started some play around the crack and sack, then I turned over and she told me that she usually didn't do 'this' for her customers but she would do it to 'take care of me' - and then she told me some funny story about it being unhealthy if you don't have release, that sex is a part of life and that her own doctor recommended she get a small vibrator (as she's single) to keep her healthy!

Anyway, there was no boobplay but she was happy for me to stroke her backside and rub her slit through her pants, and actually seemed to get off on that quite a bit. And her tug technique and raunchy words and sounds of encouragement make me think I'm not the only customer she 'takes care of'! But a great ending to a great massage and for no extra money apart from the cost of the one-hour session - that's a top approach to customer satisfaction!

Name: Mia (Mya?) - pronounced "Mee-a"
Age: Late 20s, 'the girl next door' who isn't a stunner but is easy on the eye and you wonder what she'd be like in the sack...
Size/shape: Medium height, curvey
Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese
Services: Strip and happy ending
Value for money/recommend?: Yes.

I've seen Mia twice now, and while at first glance she doesn't seem to be one from the top shelf, she's got a simple easy-to-overlook appeal which is doubled when she gets off her kit and takes care of you. In the buff she's got just a little padding here and there but you can't help but look at her and think "Wow, some guy who thinks she is plain will be in for a bit of a shock when she gets going!". In fact, my most recent visit with her was the last booking of the night, and afterwards I was sitting at a nearby cafe when she walked past wearing the same plain clothes as she's had in the shop. She's definitely not going to turn heads, but again, she's a delightfully cute and appealing young lady. 

Her massage is good, maybe 8/10, and both times I've been with Mia she's been happy to strip down and allow me some play with her boobs, bum and slit while she goes to work on me. No rimming - doesn't seem that any of the ladies I've encountered at 29A do this - but still does more than good enough to get me over the line each time. Mia also wears glasses and doesn't take them off the whole time, which I find oddly appealing!

Both times she's not asked for any extra for the tug, just for the strip-down - in fact, last visit I had only a pair of $20s left, offered her both and she said "No, too much" and took just one of them. Nice!!!

Name: Alice
Prices: $50 for tug + strip (but not all the way, underwear remains on) and a little tit'n'clit play
Age: mid-late 20s
Size/shape: Average height and build for Chinese
Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese
Services: Tug & limited strip
Value for money/recommend?: Not for the $50 extra that she charged

Some time back I posited a rule to be known as FlyBoy's Law. This dictated that more often than not the quality of the rub was inversely proportional to the quality of the tug and availability of extras, ie the sensual/sexual component.

By and large, this rule has held true in my experience. There are a very few exceptions, and even those vary between themselves. Linda at Haymarket was one, as she gave a superb massage plus a superb tug and some extras were on the menu for regulars. Natalie at Tiandi combines an A-grade massage with a top tug but no extras of any sort beyond that. Linda at Vital matches a proper massage with a pleasing tug. Jenny, the owner of 29A, gives a great massage and top tug but extras beyond that are (so far) limited.

In other words, the better the actual massage the less chance of a totally knock-out tug, and the less chance you'll get extras which go well beyond the tug.

Alice is a good example of FlyBoy's Rule beging generally true but also having a little flex. She's mid-late 20s, easy on the eye although not a knockout. She has excellent English, the best of almost any Chinese massage girl I've encountered here, and it has a slight American twang (perhaps from picking up a fair bit of the language via American TV shows?).

Alice's massage is really good, almost on par with Jenny's - long strong muscular strokes and some circular kneading, she really works your body right. There's no hint of any extras until she whispers the option in your ear, with the caveat that it costs extra, and that's pretty much going to be the standard $20 in most of these places.

So she starts stroking me and I start stroking her, and then suggest she lose the clothes  she hesitates, suggests she will for extra but will not take of the underwear - fair enough, I think, so off comes the pink-coloured nurses uniform to reveal a cute body and adorable matching patterned underwear. Yes, matching - not something you see in a lot of Asian rub'n'tug ladies, more often than not it seems to be a mis-match of whatever's clean that morning.

While Alice keeps her heavily-padded bra on, she's okay for me to ease one boob out and gently finger and tongue the dark bud of the nipple, while also slowly sweeping a hand around her backside, then under and up to her crotch and the slit behind her panties, which she shows signs of getting into and also reciprocates the movement around my own taint. That said, the tug is methodical more than sensual - it just happens that a near-naked Chinese girl wanking my well-oiled willy turns me on enough to get me across the finish line.

We've hit the full hour with no time for a little head or hand massage, so Alice helps clean me up before I dress. I open my wallet to fix up the bill  $75 for the hour, which is standard for this place, and how much for Alice? I'm thinking $20 for the tug plus another $20 for the rest, but she says it costs $50. Well, I'm not going to argue the toss for $10, but it strikes me that this is above the odds compared to other ladies here and of course $50 in some other shops means a fully nekkid pretty young thing doing the bodyslide.

So: a good massage but the happy ending was average and the 'extras' not really the best way to splash your cash.

Jenny's a friendly late 30's early 40's milf, and was chatting away while she felt my ass...
Phone rang and when she came back she said another younger lady from the other shop in willoughby rd would be over as there was a mix up with another customer (Bruce, if you are reading, you obviously go there waaaaay to much .
Little indonesian x girl named anna arrived 5 mins later. Nice pink dress slightly gaping, nice bod, ave face, but hands like an evil genius. 40 mins into a great massage start to get some nice tackle rubbing, and then some really nice fondling followed by the usual "turn over now".
Typical "mmm very big cock" murmurs and  tells me that she will give me a happy ending... Sweeeet!
Unfortunately she's fucking great at it, and although i tried my best to feel her up she made me blow just as the fingers were going into the panties!
Damage $65 per hour massage
Tip $20 (although none asked for).

29A 47 Neridah Street Chatswood

With the change at Albany - too much for too little.. I though I may try this place.  It is upstairs at the back of the complex off Victoria Street near Lemon Gove

Name: Inky (so I was told)
Age: maybe late 20s or early 30s
Size/shape: pretty nice
Nationality: Chinese
Service: Strip, RnT & DaTY
Value: Good but not Albany
Recommend: just like Arny - I'll be back

Went in and was greeted by a girl in a pinkish 'nice nurse' outfit, promising.

Stuck for time so went $35 for 30M.  Massage was alright, Inky didn't mind me feeling her smooth thighs, then she was on my back grinding and doing various moves, then she giggles in my ear with a cheeky smile.  Shortly after there was a bit of crutch tease and then the question was asked.  $50 for body to body was on offer, so why not?  Inky happily let me suckle on her pert nipples but was nicely declined my request for BJ, so I suggested I go to the Y.  So there she was burying the back of my head into the pillow while she worked on little me which wasn't going to be too hard as it had become a fore gone conclusion.

The nice thing was when all was over they were still nice with the other lady asking on my way out how it was with her confirming 'she is very good'.  I will be back to see if I can get the BJ next time!

Decided to go back for my hat and found two women in residence. 
Ended up with CiCi although wasn't offered a choice. 
Age - 27
From: PRC
Looks; average
Body: average

Had a 60m massage for $65 and would say that the massage was good but not great. Certainly not as good as the last time. Cici was nice, chatty, but way to calculating for me (you know the type). 
Offered HJ for $20 and would allow touching although the stockings pretty much ruled out any really good fingering. 
Said she might do more next visit. 
Nice HJ followed by head massage. 
All in all a reasonable massage, good but not great.

Well... Even in club Nerida you can lose out. 
Car needed a wash and couldn't help but think that the crystal car wash on Victoria st was within spitting distance of 29a. Thought I could get the both of us polished at the same time. 
Should have twigged when the only lady available was wearing jeans under her nice pink shirtdress. As per usual was in for the hour with a PRC lady named Sunny. 
Started to worry when 5m in she said she was just filling in as Jenny was short staffed. She comes from one of the Victoria st 2nd floor places. 40m in and the oil still hasn't started so ask her if she does "happy massage" she replies "you aren't happy with this?" with a smile. Fuck. 20more minutes to go knowing I'm getting nothing. Not even an ass massage.  
Massage: good
All else: aweful!
29a..... You've let me down!

So... Still ready to burst I think I will head over to the sister shop at 108 penshurst. See review there...

Sorry to hear of not-the-best experiences at 29A... it does depend a lot of the lady of course, which is why I find hitting AXR on my iPhone is great when I am out and about, I can walk in (or call up) and know who to see and who not to!

Eg: went in last week, as I had an appointment with Jenny - but Jenny had ended up double-booked at Willoughby, so wasn't there - one lady I'd not seen before offers herself for massage, says her name is Cici - that along rang an alarm bell of 'not that great' so I passed, took myself to see Selena at 6 and was not disappointed!

A few quick updates on 29A.

Christmas special - 30% discount!
One of the things I like about Jenny and the way she runs her business is that she keeps things humming along with little tricks like discounts - something that's par for the course in most retail environments but less often seen in 'adult' places, and rarely in Asian places despite their generally keen business sense. So today I note they're running a 30% discount, which Jenny says will run up to and for the week following Christmas. That's pretty good value. It means a one hour booking comes in at $45. Sure, there's no discount on the tug or other extras, but any saving's a good one, right?

There's a new Alice
Earlier in this thread I reviewed Alice, and gave her a very average rating. Now there's a new Alice on the books and she's a lot better! Saturdays only, mid-20s, quite attractive, very good English and great personality, bright and playful. The sort of girl I could easily fall for outside of 29A. It helps that she's cute and a little curvy (rather than skinny). Very good massage and a happy ending that left me very happy indeed (helped no doubt by her shedding the rest of her kit to reveal lovely B-cups with dark-pink nipples and a slit that was made for stroking).

There's also a new Cici
I wish they wouldn't keep using the same names as previous girls, especially ones who've proven less-than-stellar. I sampled the just-started Cici today  she's everything Alice is (above) but more so. Even cuter, prettier, sexier in an innocent sweet girl-next-door way (and also, superb English with a cute little accent). Only her second day (she's a Monday-only girl), on top of the $45 for the hour it was $20 for the handjob (very nicely done) which I bumped up to $50 for her to shed her uniform and bra (the pants stayed on, for this time at least), ended up in a nice clutch with me sitting on the side of the table, my legs wrapped around Cici as I played with her perfect young B+ boobs (very sensitive nipples) and she eagerly encouraged me to shoot the load over her breasts. Can do, honey!

Bigfist, I'm sure there would be worse ways to spend an hour! The trick really is getting a really good girl, although I think that's less of an issue now than a few months back. And it's nice to see some youngers (mid-20s) ladies at this place of late, even though as many of us know, an older lady can be pretty fantastic as well!

But if you can book for a Saturday or Monday, I reckon the new Alice or the new Cici would be good value. They're both great fun, Alice is a real sweetie and Cici is quite sexy in that 'sweet girl' way. And there's always something extra-appealing about a cute sweet girl who you think "If I saw her on the street she'd just look so sweet and like a 'nice girl'", and then having that girl there bare-topped in front of you while you play with her delightful boobs and she caresses you and tugs you!

Of course and as always, YMMV. Not saying that for your benefit, Bigfist, as I know you know that's how this goes, but it's a reminder for others reading this thread and indeed these forums (but especially this thread).

There are some Asian massage girls who will put it all on the table for almost any customer, but the majority exercise some choice in what they offer and who they offer it to. Being a 'nice' guy who makes them laugh, puts them at ease, is gentle with them and also whom they know is a trusted regular who gets a tick from the boss all counts towards extras!

I whole-heartedly agree with you Flyboy. Be a 'nice' guy ...put them at ease, be gentle with them and as a trusted regular you'll get a service that others can only dream about.
Our paths must have nearly crossed Flyboy as I was there late Monday afternoon. It was very busy on Thursday afternoon so I had to come back later to take Eve, my regular Monday -Tuesday girl, to the VIP room for a treat.
I'm surprised that no-one has mentioned the VIP room yet. It is fabulous. For those who are regular, more than 5 visits I think, Jenny, the switched on owner, will mention that there is an exclusive room set aside for a mere $95 hour. Yes that includes the fullbody massage.

 29A Neridah VIP Room
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name:Jenny the sexy MILF owner

Establishment (if applicable):Northshore Oriental Massage

Contact Details/Address:29A Neridah

Hours of Business: (if known or applicable)

Prices:

Age:40+

Size/shape:Typical Asian but with a butt

Nationality or Ethnicity:PRC

Services:Great massage and very happy ending

Value for money/recommend?:Yes yes yes

Booked Jenny the other day and as I am a regular the $35 30 mins massage includes the tug but usually little else in the way of extra,s. Guess what, got to the shop in Chatswood and all the rooms are full. No problem says Jenny we will go to the VIP room, great!!
Jenny has done a first class job with this room and concept although I am not really sure what extra the room gives you in the way of services but it is very private and if you had a complient female companion it is definately a place that FS could be offered. If you think you have a chance with a particular girl to go all the way make sure you book this room its probably going to be worth it. 
Anyway back to Jenny, usual high class rub but I sensed Jenny was alot more relaxed in this private room with no staff around to walk in, so on the turnover I decided to push it a bit and to see what would happen. Bike pants came off, then underpants came off and wow she has the most beautifull looking pussy I have seen in a while. Some of these asian chicks have seen some cock so their pussies look like they have been hit with a meat cleaver! but not Jenny, tight, trim and looks like an 18 year old girls pussy. Didn,t really get inside it but it was getting wet towards the end and I couldn,t hold off any longer. Jenny has only small breasts but I find it amusing that you can get the pants off but not the top, HeHe. Great massage and happy ending from a really great lady who aims to please and does.
I was so horny I shot myself in the eye WTF........now I know how those porno chicks feel it was fucking red for 2 days...my eye that is LOL. Anyway keep supporting her she is another great find.

Chaps - can I humbly suggest we refrain from too many specifics about services here, especially in the VIP Room?

I'm not trying to be a spoilsport, not do I wish to in any way lessen the value of the information we all share here - that's one of the things that makes AXR so great!

It's just that we have, to our sadness, discovered in the past that too much detail on what extras a parlour offers can make for trouble, mainly with council inspectors (as well as sometimes unrealistically raising the expectations of some less-experienced punters).

There's a restricted Silver Members lounge for those who have hit Silver Member status and this is a slightly safer place to post more detailed accounts  but in the main public forum, I'd suggest a little more discretion and leaving a bit more for the punter to discover for himself.

Again, I know this sounds like it goes against the grain of sharing all the delicious details on the best ladies to see  and when that includes some extra-special time with a lovely and genuine MILF like Jenny (who's a top lady in her own right), well, it's understandably hard to resist!  but again, I would suggest that future posts in the main forum (especially about what goes on in the VIP room) be perhaps toned down a little, in the interest of all of us enjoying 29A (and the VIP room) for a long time to come!

Ahhh the fabled silver lounge. Is it like going to a nightclub, getting access to the restricted area only to figure out that the normal area is mote fun?
But yes, have to agree. Especially when kuringgai and wheelababy councils pay private dicks to sleep with women so they can find the illegal brothels. If anyone wants a link for that job just ask me here.

The silver lounge is akined to say m15+ than to say PG.. It is in accordance with to being in a public place and forum.. It is no more fun, better or elitist for that matter, just more sensitive and descriptive in nature and able to be used for reviews that fit this as such.. 

I think it is to preserve the intel gathered and also not cause alarm or ruckus when ymmv on services provided.. Every Tom, dick or Harry would expect that they would receive the same services reviewed by others thus placing pressure on the girls and establishment themselves.. As they say.. Too much of a good thing going can turn bad.. This is my advice, so please respect the boundaries and allow the natural course of the service flow.. It aint called punting for nothing.. Discretion is the key here as mentioned..

Oh, and I hope no-one takes my suggestion any wrong way - I am not a mod, just a punter as we all are, but I know from experience (cv Albany) that for some services it's better for descriptions to be a bit on the discreet side, lest things go awry and we all lose out.

I tend to try to work on the basis of only reviewing services that are legal (based on the approval the place has) or that are openly advertised, and perhaps hint that more is available. Of course I sometimes fail my own guidelines. In the recent past, I have been taking a greater interest in Local Government or the wider public attitude towards our hobby. The various forums provide an excellent research tool for us, but also for Council Brothel Inspectors (yes, they do exist), private detectives and Chris Seage's Brothel Busters consultancy. On AXR, reviews are a little less accessible because you need to post one review to achieve Bronze and be able to access the rest.

The restricted access areas - Silver here, the (ex) Shed on FIA and the equivalents on Punter Planet are probably the right place for more intimate details, but this will not stop a first time poster from saying "I went to such and such massage place and ended up getting BBBJ, DFK, GFE, BBFS and all the rest".

Random thoughts, and I am probably wandering off topic.

This may be a bit off topic of the thread, apologies but it seems relevant to some of the conversation.  I agree that there should be discretion on some of the more explicit extras so that we don't suffer for it in the end.  I would like to know about the silver section or if indeed there could be a specific section for the seasoned punter to share stories from beyond the traditional menu.  I have 4 ladies from RnT's (all in Crows nest) that I have exchanged phone numbers with and have private meetings on occasion.  Sure I still pay for it but its a different experience again... the feeling of not being on the clock and a somewhat better value service.  I don't share these stories on here for fear of it having repercussions.  Wondering if there is a way to somehow share with each other so that we all benefit from it. Anyway, meeting up with one tomorrow in a cheap hotel room on the North Side.  3 hours of value for the price of 1! Love it.

Hamandcheese (hey, I bet that your extras are 'tomato'!): that's a good point to raise, even if it's not purely on 29A I think it's relevant, especially given the last few posts.

I must admit, the thought of an arrangement similar to yours has crossed my mind sometimes. My own 'outside work' experiences with rub'n'tug ladies has not been on any commercial basis, more as 'friends' (with benefits), but it's sometimes occurred to me that yes, a girl who does 'extreme extras' (ie FS) could do a lot better for herself through some private bookings - she keeps all the money, rather than have the house take 50% off the hour or whatever. And you're also right, a better environment and more relaxing time as well.

Not sure how a restricted-but-not-really section would work out - am sure mods will have ideas - but you know, anyone interested can always PM you, and some of us also have punter email addresses (eg flyboy.au@gmail.com !).

FMD EG      Getting back up off the floor, I was prompted to do a quick estimate of my own outlay which I had thought was becoming excessive verging on addiction. But man, you're a champion... 

I console myself thinking of it as keeping a sub-economy running, supporting struggling students, etc etc. Almost a sort of charity (always "giving") - but with a tangible, enjoyable return. Now if only I could find a way to get a tax deduction...

I'd also suggest that EG's $25k/year is less than he'd spend if he was dating / in a relationship, and gives him a LOT more fun (and in a time-efficient manner geared to his own schedule, as and when he wants) without any of the hassles. So he wins - the lovely Asian ladies who enjoy his company win (both in financial terms and also in having a nice bloke as a regular client, not some drop-kick) - and he helps keep those shops open for our enjoyment as well.

Well tis the season to be jolly so in the guise of spending a long time shopping at the chase I would instead spend a short time shopping and a long time in club Nerida.  
Walked in and out came Tina again (from wheelababy shop). There was an absolute glamour there today who wasn't offering massages - I hope she is next time. 
Now last time all I wanted was a tug as i had had the massage and Tina fit the bill perfectly. This time I was after both. The massage ended up more a rub. Very very pleasant but she didn't want to go hard. Perhaps it's because I am injured ATM and all the bandages scared her, but not sure. 
Anyway, well worth the $45 price for the hour. 
The tug was great. $30 extra (ie $75 in total) and ended up with a finger in her soaking box as she sucked and jerked on my knob. Blew a very satisfactory load (missed her face though - I dont like blowing in a womans face normally, but when they are the ones doing the aiming, i consider it fair play. Can often go over a foot which catches a few unawares- some get the shits, but I'm always reasonable and suggest that they were the ones pointing the gun....). 
After a very thorough cleanup she dressed me (again, it may be the injured thing but I love letting her do this) and sent me on my merry way. 
Another hour well spent at the club.

Paid a visit today, was hoping Yuki was on today, she does a wonderful head/neck/shoulder massage.
So this very nice girl, Mey who look like in their late 20s or early 30s intros me. Shes not slim nor chubby but toned and smooth. B size with large dark nipples. Though she wears a big bra.

Paid for the hour, got into a room and a MILF lady comes in soon after. Now she look like late 40s. So I said I preferred Mey, she obliged and Mey comes in. 

If you want a good massage, Mey would not be the best. However her touch is very sensual and somewhat erotic. I did ask for soft but firm.

So the massage starts and we chat about the usual, asked which part of China she was from, she says Beijing and how long shes been here. Studying and wants to learn english etc. She says I wasnt here for a massage but for a chat. 

She was wearing a uniform, all wrinkled, but allowed feeling and peeked underneath the uniform. She looked amazing and was wearing red matching bra and underwear.

Jenny shows up and I had a little chat with her. She said she only works at the Willoughby place now, but you can book her. I said definitely next time. She looks magnificent for her age.

After a while it was time to turn over and offers extras, we negotiated and got more and because she was cute i paid $50 ie $95 total.
Didnt go over the edge however still had an awesome time here. Definitely put her as second favourite. Though Yuki second for a good massage. You walk out of there numb and feeling good.

After leaving I saw a very young girl there too, early 20s, slim and wasnt able to check her cup size as she and the milf were preparing the other room.

Somewhat not satisfied though had a wonderful time. later I decided to paid a visit to 19a Brodie, Rydalmere after reading some reviews. Review be in that thread. It was AWESOME.

Yes, exactly - that's very well put - and when she gets her gear off you realise that she's quite a pleasing little package under there. On one of my previous visits to her, afterwards I grabbed dinner at the Chinese place on the corner of Victoria & Archer, was sitting outside and she walked by (having finished her shift) and she was just this 'average' Chinese girl but you couldn't help but smile for the knowledge that you know what she's like under those clothes, you know she's got this cute body and is quite enthusiastic!

EG, is that this coming week? If so, I think 29A is closed today (Monday) but the rest of the week would be fine. Seek guidance here on who does extras and how far they go, but FS is not on the general menu at 29A, and you might want to try their shop on Penhurst St Willoughby for better variety as well as better rooms. (Or, if you find a recommendation for a very good girl from 29A or Penshurst St, ask about booking 29A's VIP room). Otherwise I would recommend Selena at 6A Neridah.

Yes, it is this coming week. I suspect the pickings will be a bit thin Monday and Tuesday (public Holidays and all) - and Tuesday may be another assignation with Jane at Artarmon. I will certainly take note of what is written here (as I hope others benefit from what I write here). And, of course, I will report what I find - if somewhat delayed by my typing speed.

EG or o&b - soon to be decided.

FYI of all: I was in Chatswood this evening for dinner, drove past Oriana (7 Help Street) on the way home and it was was well and truly open  so if any northside punters are still looking for some post-Christmas 'relief', that might do the trick (and of course Oriana is usually open until the wee hours).

And the Hampden Rd Artarmon establishments were also open, well at least 78a, 88 and 116 were. The stairwell and sign for the Thai Massage at 104 were illuminated. I didn't climb the stairs to find out more. This at about 7:30 this evening. And the Lindfield Thai place was open yesterday, but closed early (about 7:00 pm)

Guys: just a quick update that as per her pre-Christmas plans, Jenny has now sold 29A. So if you're looking for her or any of her girls, your best bet will be the 'original' Northshore Oriental Health Centre at 6/108 Penshurst St, Willoughby - which is located in the block next to the AAMI centre, almost across from the Post Office (ph 02 9967 4977, open weekdays 10am-8pm, weekends 10am-6pm, see thread here).

Jenny is still keeping the VIP Room at 15A (around the rear of Neridah Square, directly off Oscar Street) for customers who wants the convenience and/or privacy (ahem!) of that quiet and cosy little den. And some of her 29A girls might continue to work there under the new owner (more for the sake of keeping up their previous Chatswood customers, although she says they all want to continue at 6/108).

But it's too early to tell if the quality of service at 29A is going to

(a) remain the same - which I personally doubt, as many of us have seen what happens when a new owner takes on an established business with a good rep (let's call it 'The Albany Effect'), and Jenny reckons the new owner of 29A has no prior experience in the Asian massage arena

(b) slide down a few notches - either due to poor management, poor choice of ladies in future, or (gasp, horror of horrors!) going 100% legit!

(c) ramp up to become more like the old Albany in terms of a 'no holds barred, everything on the menu' place - which I doubt for several reasons, but hey, one thing I've learned in this game is that you can't rtule anything out! Sure, 29A's rooms are not very big, but nor were those at Albany - heck, they weren't even rooms, just curtains hanging down from the ceiling  and while 29A doesn't have a shower, nor did Albany when it began...

So, who here is prepared to take a punt in the truest sense of the word - willing to pay the new 29A a visit and potentially, nobly, selflessly take one for the team and in doing so earn the professional respect of your fellow AXR punters and 1,000 free bonus AXR points (which are redeemable for basically f*ck all, but it's the thought that counts, right?).

Jaitang: I reckon we'll see all of those three ladies at 6/108 for sure. Jenny seems to be a good boss who takes good care of her girls. I've enjoyed my time my Mey, Cici and others at 29A and hope to continue sampling these and other delights at 6/108 (or 15A, as the mood and lady requires).

 29A/47 Neridah St, Chatswood - 02 9411 2618

Executive summary: cute but not the best value for your rub'n'tug dollar, especially in Chatswood


So I've been tending to play favourites in recent weeks - hell, recent months - okay, okay, the last frigging year! Well, when you're on a good thing etc. Many of us tend to find one or two good places, one or two good ladies in those places, and that becomes the border of our experiences (unless you're punting every other day, or travelling far and wide).

For me, of late, that's been Selena at 6A Neridah; Elaine at 76A Archer; and on and off, Jenny formerly of 29A and then back to Penshurst St Willoughby before she headed overseas the other week. (And going back a few months, Natalie at Tiandi was also on that list; going back some more, of course, takes one back to the good old days of Mina and co at Albany).

Anyone who's read reviews of Selena and Elaine know what to expect: good massage (especially Selena's) and a fun, expert and enthusiastic approach to the non-rub side of the session. Both are highly recommended, and as Elaine works only Tuesday and Thursday compared to Selena working most every day, Selena is easier to get to see.

But today was not a Tuesday nor a Thursday, and Selena was booked out, so what's a Chatswood-based FlyBoy to do?

While I was tempted to try one of the other ladies at 76A, head up the highway to The House of the Croaking Frog, or even try Linda's Vital Massage  just next to Chatswood Chase and see what luck I had (as that place can be a little hit and miss).

But no - in a selfless act of sacrifice I decided to TOFTT and try 'the new' 29A Neridah.

This is the little two-room shop which Jenny bought (before her it used to be a bit of a dive, albeit one that yielded surprising extras from time to time) and renovated, then sold late last year. 

I must admit to have often been curious about how this place would fare. Some of Jenny's girls initially stayed on, she told me, doing a shift there as well as some shifts with her at Willoughby, and their regulars kept coming - but it's as we've so often before seen things, a new manager doesn't always have the same quality control or attitude to customer service and things slowly yet inevitably wind down from there.

Yet the pendulum can also swing in the other direction, and I wondered to myself, What if the new 29A was like this? What if, in the face of slower business or tough competition, they had done the route of Mina and Albany?

So I made my way to the new 29A to find out.

It's exactly as Jenny left it, which is to its credit - good carpet and fittings, small basins in each room so the girls can run water for a hot wet towel.

The girl on this fay was Yuki, a cute late 20s five-foot-nothing girl - and despite her decent English I had trouble placing her - she looked partly Chinese but also not. Turns out that Yuki is Chinese-Malaysian, which does seem a nice mix in this instance.

We step into our room amd I opt for the 45 minute massage, which Yuki says is $50, but then she runs her hand over my crotch and with a smile says "this massage, $30 extra". Well, okay, that's one way to broach the subject, and I opt in to the McDonalds-style upsell.

The massage is pleasing but not great  not a real massage, not much in the way of muscular work but at least more than aimless stroking. Maybe a half hour goes by and Yuki segues into the tackle-tickle, starting with the inner thigh and balls, then I hear a few tissues leaving the box and she wipes down my butt-cheeks and crack... I wonder if this is a prelude to anything (I mean, hey, they're spotlessly clean before the massage, I take care of these things!), feel the gentlest blowing around the a*hole but nothing further from that direction, then it's gentle fingers with the slightest hint of rimming as the balls continue to get worked.

Yuki asks me to turn over and starts going to work on FlyBoy Jnr with a sly encouraging smile - I stroke her back and feel her breasts, she leans in and whispers 'You want me to take off? $40 for everything". Well, that's a bit above the rack rate, but Yuki does appear to have a nice rack so again, thinking only of research for my AXR brethren, I agree.

Off comes the kit and yes, a lovely rack indeed  ripe, firm and fully-formed, on the edge of being C cups with large areola - add this to her height, trim waist, not-too-old looks and cheeky smile and it's a pleasing package to behold. Unfortunately holding is about as much as she allows  I pull her close and gently kiss her nipples but she squirms a little, says she doesn't like that, so that's clearly off the list - although she is, happily, happy to have the breasts held and the nubs stroked a little. Downstairs it's the same  just a little stroking around the slit and pressure at the edge, no penetration.

As Yuki works me up she dips a finger into the date, just a little bit, to help me get across the line - not that this is too much of an ask, as I'm enjoying looking at her and her smile and those delightful boobs. But I am a man who enjoys closer contact, all the same.

The job done, I get a wipe-down with a warm wet towel, a head massage and arm/hand massage until time is up.

Yuki works Wednesdays only at 29A, but two other days at a massage place in Lane Cove (she didn't say which one, but some here may recognise her by the description?).

In summary: despite the happy ending I can't put Yuki on the Recommended By FlyBoy list.

You'll get a better massage from Natalie or Selena, and even Elaine; you'll get a better tug from any of those ladies; and Elaine is the one most given to Yuki-style extras (Natalie certainly is just about the tug, with Selena YMMV). And all of them have lower prices, both for the session and the extras (if offered).

I left a very happy camper.

Thanks fuper would really like to get with Jessie again if you find her and only because she is gives a really good massage I have a bad back and she seems to be able to fix it and no other girls from chatswood /crows nest seem to be in same field I think she was qualified in China but could get qualified her. Anyway I think eveyone has reported not much else goes on in that place at Katherine st.
Maybe after your report I should try new Jessie but really after back work not other work.

Services Provided: Massage + Extras

Value for money/recommend?: Yes

My experience/comments:

I met Jessie in a Friday evening around 6pm. I think I was probably the last customer, but when I was there a guy showed up and requested a 10 minute massage with the other girl (I couldn't see her). Go figure.

Jessie is nice looking, she is kind of cute and has a nice smile. She is quiet, which doesn't bother me at all. 

Went for the 30 minutes massage, as it was my first time with her. 

The massage didn't start very well, but eventually got better. She clearly knows what she is doing. She even massaged my feet.

Then she leaned over my ear and asked me if I wanted a HJ. What a question!

So time to turn over, and a nice tug started. I was really horny that day, so I asked her if I could get some extras. She agreed to a covered BJ. I didn't push further than that. The CBJ was pretty good, so I didn't last long. In two minutes I blew up a huge amount.

She gave me a hot towel (there are no showers here). I left the room, and I was prepared to give her 50$, as she mentioned 30$ when we discussed the extras. Turns out it was 30$ including the tug, so the total damage was 65$. Not too bad for a good massage, a tug and a CBJ.

Will I be back? Probably, it is good value, and to tell you the truth, Jessie is definitely in the MILF category for me. 

Cheers

Hours of Business :  10AM to 7PM

Rates : $35/$60 30/60 + $50 (HJ/B2B)

Age : Late Twenties

Size/shape : Rubenesque

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : Massage + B2B + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Not sure

My experience/comments :

Back was sore and in need of a rub so thought I would try this place out if I managed to find it in the labyrinth that is 47 Neridah Street.  Up the stairs and opened the door.  No one there and no one answered the door. Eventually, a voice called out she would be there in a few minutes.

Eventually Anne/Amy emerged and bundled me into the "staff waiting room" so that the previous Punter could escape into the cold! Into the small but tidy room she dragged me (so small I would have had to go outside to change my mind!).  $$ for standard rub handed across, I removed my garments and lay upon the waiting massage table with anticipation and trepidation.  Amy/Anne proceeded to give me a firm and professional massage for the next 20 odd minutes.  Brushed the tackle a few times and apologised to me for doing so! Then came the inevitable "turn over" and offer of other things!

Now Anne/Amy is not a large girl height wise but has a rubenesque figure and a gorgeous face!  HJ and B2B negotiated.  Clothes removed, B2B commenced and a pretty good tug provided.  She was trimmed not shaved and had no issues with touching (after she made me wash my hands!) became quite wet and was quite happy to present her large (and yummy) hoots for the attention of my mouth.  Satisfactory conclusion reached all round.

She had an intriguing habit of looking directly into my eyes with that gorgeous face of hers. Speaks english like an Aussie and certainly isn't a recent import.

Didn't ask about more adventurous offerings so Punters will need to make own enquiries there. Probably not the greatest value but different from my usual fare.

An interesting location tucke up the back of the block.   The entrance looks like a legit oriental therapy suite... plenty of physiology/anatomical charts.

Anyway, into the room and intriduced to the only girl (who was asked back by the mamasan .. she was walking out as I walked in).
I was asked..."you been here before" to which I replied with "no, but some regulars recommended the place to me"  (thanks AXR reviewers - I didn't tell a fib).

So I kit-off and onto the table.   A good massage for 20 mins or so (I chose the quick 30 min option).   And the massage was good.   I'm turned over and she gets to teh rtfan "you want massage here" .... replying with a smile "yes please".   Rates explained +$20 and +$30 for all nude.   I figure why not.

She disrobed.  PLeasing to the eye, with a little belly (I suspect post child), with wonderful bullet nipples ..  She tried to kiss me which I found a little off putting, while not expecting it.  Then boobs shoved into my face (okay, I enjoyed that).  And that's when I was pleasantly surprised.    "You no come in mouth, tell me if you coming " in broken english, followed by an exquisite bbbj bringing me to the edge.

All good, and at a reasonable price.

Haven't been back here since my visit in July. Popped in here and who should be there but Anna from my last visit.

 Anna provided me with a firm and professional massage and overall the service was the same as last time with one exception.

At the usual "turn over" Anna asked me if I wanted HJ etc $20 + $30 Nude or I could have FS starting at $60. This hadn't been offered before so something has changed. Not in the mood for FS so just went with the HJ.

Good technique and a pleasant lady but may return to try her FS offering.

BJS - could this be same 'Anna' I saw last week (late Jan)?

A more curvy lass, big smile and .. well ... not a size 8.  More like a 14.  But lovely bullet nips.
Anyway, did find out that Julia no longer works there.   Bummer.

Decided on the 1/2 hour option, prices as noted in the posts above.

FS was offered, but declined.   HJ+ nude set me back $50 on top of $35 for a decent firm massage.  Problem was the firm continued to teh HJ.   I thought she was going to rub my skin off until I asked her to relax the grip a little.

Got me over the line us in time ... but was a below average experience.   She was the only one there and kept answering the door each time it opened.

My experience/comments:
So took me a while to find this place, after eventually finding it i went into one of the rooms which is very small and was told to take my clothes off, as im taking my clothes off in comes jessica, asks if I want a oil massage, I say yes and lie on the table. The massage was very soft, although she knew all the right places so overall was a pretty good massage and towards the end started the tackle tickle.

Then it was time to turn over, she asked me if I wanted extras, I asked if she could give me a blow job while nude, she said for $50 so i agreed, then as I gave her the money she said for another $10 she will do FS... why not i thought. She got very excited, seemed like she enjoyed what she did so I was happy with that. So she starts giving me a CBJ which was ok i guess then told me to stand up as she lay on the table and spread her legs and we started going at it in mish, she was very tight and as I was fucking her she enjoyed it alot, she pulled me closer to her and hugged me and i started punding harder and then she came and so did i after that. There was still 5 mins remaining so she lay ontop of me hugging then gave me a head massage and then climbed on the table again and did a little dance for me, then time was up and I left. Overall it was a good massage, Jessica is very enthusiastic and is worth going to see.

Value for money/recommend? : Probably not this girl.

My experience/comments :
Came in and was told to go to the first room on as you walk in, very small room. Clothes off and on the table, she walks in about 2 minuets later, she likes to talk a lot but i felt like i was being questioned a lot on my personal life. The massage was very hard, left my back hurting the next day, she had it in her because of her size, she got a hot towel and wiped the oil off then started playing with the sack for about 2 minuets, asked to turn over and see if i wanted extras, I took the FS option for $60 nd off comes her clothes, she is quiet big, so if your not into the larger women like me, don't go for this girl, she gets on top of me but the table is too small for her so it was very awkward for her, i sucked on her nipples quiet a lot which she enjoys, her nipples are the bullet type ones, got them very hard, I cum and she wipes me down then leaves me in the room for about 5 mins to relax, put my clothes on and out i went. Oh and she asked me to take the dom with me and throw it out outside. I would go back here for Jessica but probably not for this girl.

My experience/comments: Called up and was told by the mamasan to try the new girl "she is very cute", when i got there she was busy and the mamsan sai she would do the massage and Misa will handle the extras. Massage was good, opted for a soft one, good conversation then wiped down with a towel and in came Misa, she is ok looking, nothing great but not bad either. Asked for a clothes off HJ and gave her $40, took off her clothes but left on her g string an said i wasnt allowed to touch inside it, even when i tried to touch her tits she blocked my hand... so I was only allowed rubbing from the outside of the gstring however i did pull it down a few times. Hand job was pretty good, playe a lot with the balls before getting to the hand job and got me over the line in 10 mins. Overall the massage was good but the conditions of the tug wer not, the tug itself however was pretty good. She does not do FS.

Called in and was told Jan is working, not sure if thats her actual name, I couldn't understand it properly. The massage was very good and relaxing. Was offered FS when i turned over but she was kind of a turn off for me because her teeth were rotting brown..... Although her tug technique was good, started off slow and got me over the line in 5 minutes. Touching was allowed only over the clothes, I rubbed her pussy and could feel how wet it was through her panties. This girl is not for me though, dosen't appeal to me.

Value for money/recommend? efinitely not


Was in search of smiling angels at 24 Oscar early evening yesterday. 24 appeared closed.... wandered around the complex and stumbled into 29A ( Oriental health Massage ). 

Quite a small , two room establishment that has seen better days. An overwhelming stench of wet carpet or damp towels assaulted the senses, however, as it was very cold and wet outside I decided to stay and do the due diligence.

Thirty minute massage $35.00. No choice of lady. Was ushered into a very small room and told to remove cloths. Jing, my appointed masseuse, appeared some three minutes afterwards.She asked if I wanted hard or soft massage, I chose hard. Massage was very inexperienced and perfunctory and was asked to turn over after fifteen minutes. B2B offered but declined...opted for HJ only. Jing's manner and atmosphere was so lacking in eroticism that I needed to recruit images of past perfect punts in order to get over the line. Jing's constant glances at the wall clock were also off-putting. Jing disappeared briefly and returned with a cloth to remove the massage oil from the bod. This was a mistake! The cloth stank as if it had been in "service" for a fortnight, unwashed and used exclusively on all punters. As soon as I returned home I cauterised myself in the shower!!! 

Generally I don't like to give a bad wrap to any establishment but, this place seems so unhygienic. Maybe it was just my bad luck on the day but I won't ever return. There are so many better options in and around Chatswood.

She is very good at massage. A bit older then what I prefer. 
If you want massage + extras then you can find better others.
But if you are after someone who give a really good massage and
HJ then she is the person.

I have seen few other younger girls started in this shop Will try and 
give more review later.

Jinji or something like that at 29A/47 Neridah St Chatswood.

Open: 10am-7pm

She said she was 26 years although looked a little older, rougher. She wore a short denim skirt and offered HJ and take off straight away. So much for working up to it and creating some sexual tension. She was not fat but a little bigger than usual - I'm guessing a size 10.

It was an ok massage including some TT. It would have been $55 for the hour and I had indicated earlier I might extend, but I would see. But somehow she failed to inspire me and I just paid for the half hour at $35. .Wouldn't allow touching or anything else without extra $.

Would I return? Well there's so much choice around Neridah alone, not to mention Chatswood that I probably won't.

I suppose it would be value for money if wanting to extend or seek out extras or if a different girl was available. She was the only one available on this occasion (I think) as it was a quiet rainy day.

Best to ring and book. They lock the door if both girls are busy.

I'd say Anna is pretty cautious these days. A couple of years ago, I was there on the day just after they got robbed. Turned their backs for a moment and some lowlife cunt crept in and ripped off the girls' wallets from the reception area. The girls were quite shaken by the experience.

Recently, they have almost certainly been targeted by Council snoops and are no doubt recipients of a recent letter from Willoughby Council. (This is harassment which is discriminatory and illegal in my view but that's another story).

So, phone or keep trying!

Person's Name : Anna

Establishment : Angel Babes Massage

Date of Visit : 03/07/2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: Chatswood Oriental Massage | Angel Babes Massage

Hours of Business : 10am to 6pm

Rates : $130 for 45mins (FS)

Age : 30s

Size/shape : Voluptuous

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese / Singaporean

Services Provided : R&T, FS

Value for money/recommend? : Maybe (depends what you like).

My experience/comments :

The venue is a small massage shop in a quiet community in Chatswood. There was no one there except for Anna. And as soon as she understood what I was after, she locked the door and it was just the two of us for the entire duration. I was shown to a small, dark room with a massage bed and a small sink. There's nothing worth noting except that it was very private.

As for Anna, she was easy to talk to, open to discussions. She has good hands (for massage), and generally it's a pleasure to be touched by her. I only experienced 5 minutes of massage though, because I was eager to get into the other action.

To get a negative aspect out of the way -- she didn't offer kissing. But that's for the best, because she admitted to having a cold sore on her lip. Yeah, I guess there are risks, but at least she is honest and didn't want it to affect customers. So I think that's, in a way, a plus as well. Also, Anna's body isn't  the slim, tight type, so you may have to keep that in mind. Personally, I didn't mind it too much, as I'm into mature ladies for their presence and skill, and not necessary and well-toned body.

 She does a good HJ, and offers CBJ. FS is also available (the price I listed above includes this), though I didn't feel much from it (perhaps due to her body and the condom), but it was also a little awkward due to the massage bed being quite narrow. In the end, I went back to the classic HJ. She also has alluring eyes and a "hypnotic smile" (as stated on  the website), which is enjoyable during HJ.

She's not too much of a clock-watcher, since there was nobody else at the place. But of course, you still gotta be reasonable. Overall it was a decent experience.

(Note to admin: Thanks for the feedback previously on my review. Hopefully this is now acceptable. If all's well, I'll also fix up my other one so that I could earn the free bronze membership. Cheers!)

My experience/comments:

As my favourite girl (Cindy at VIP) was not around, I thought I would try somewhere new.
I went to Angel Babes at Chatswood, and was met at the door by Lily and shown to a room with just a massage table and chair.
After the pleasantries, I gave her the $40 for half hour massage, and asked to get undressed then onto the table, while Lily went to get my change.
I was lying on my front, when Lily returned and started massaging my back. She asked if I wanted firm or soft, which I replied "firm and fun". She proceeded to provide an adequate massage, although I don’t think she has any formal training, but we all know that is not why we are there. While she was at the head of the table, with my face in the hole in the table, she would lean right over and rub my bum, and I could feel here tits on my back (she was still wearing her clothes). I patted here bum, and she did not discourage it, so I continued to rub her bum, and it was a very firm bum too.
On the roll over, she stayed at the head of the table, and leant over again to rub my chest, with here tits just inches from my nose. She was playing with my nipples (which I love) and I had my hands behind her back, gently playing with her bum. She offered naked tug for $50 which I thought was too much, so opted for $20 tug only. She oiled up my cock, and played with my balls for a bit with one have and continued to pinch and play with my nipples. She slowly started the tug, and before too long I exploded all over my stomach. She continued to stroke me, ensuring I finished before she cleaned me up.
There was no shower there, so the clean up was with tissues and a hot towel.
All up, it was an enjoyable time, and yes I would return. Although Lily was very pleasant, and we got on well, I would like to see who else is available next time.

My experience/comments : Receptionist great and friendly, nice environment, private courtyard entrance. Candy had a soft massage and wonderful brushing of hair along my back during massage. Part way through she was keen to know how often I get a massage and suggested I keep coming back to her. I commented it felt lovely with her hair brushing my back, and the topic of happy ending came up. She offered nude for a fee (can't remember but perhaps $50) and i accepted. She has a gorgeous cute little body, round bum, and lovely tits. She washed her hands, gave me a wet wipe for mine (presumably if I roamed more than casual surface brushes?), and then to rnt. I felt she could have taken that all a bit slower so I could savour but not bad. Finished off with a head massage.

 My experience/comments :

On way home from Airport and thought I'd drop into one of the old haunts. Greeted at the door by young Kelly, pleasant enough, shown to the small room, and onto the bench. Kelly returned  a few minutes later and gave a cursory 4 minute rub on the back and suggested I flip as that was why I was there...
I suggested she lose her clothes, $50, left the undies on, I moved to remove the bra, no she didn't like that, no fondling and definitely not interested in a massage. I gave up, lay down dreaming about my night before with a very  cute and experienced 30 something Malaysian girl.

I was out the door in 20 minutes with a sore dick from her vigorous yanking , She had asked me to take over so I resorted to giving myself a hand job to get over the line. 

Be another long time before I return here.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean. 

Services Provided : hj

Value for money/recommend? : no

My experience/comments : 

Popped in on my way home. Never been here but had a few alright punts in other shops in the area. 

When I walked in I was greeted by a girl Olivia at reception and she was very eager to get me in a room. Where she asked how long I want to stay? I responded how much. $50 dollars for 40 minutes and something else for a hour. I gave her 50. She said get naked and lay down. I did. 

The massage was not that great it had protential but she only really worked the left side of my mid to lower back for about 10 minutes with very minimal touching else where. She did begin to play closer to my pleasure spots which I enjoyed. She was friendly with abit of chit chat and all that. She would refer to my cock as a Banana and called me sexy and said I had a nice body. She told me to roll over. Which I thought was good. As I was getting excited but it turned out to be shocking. 

I'd been there for about 10 minutes. She asked me what I wanted. Body to body rub, sex, bj, hj. I said a hj will he fine. She asked me how much I will give her which I found interested as I thought she would of given me the set price. Also I was kinda hoping that a standard clothed hj would be included with my 50 dollars from the start. I gave her 20 dollars. She accepted my offer and then asked me if I had any change as in coins. I thought it was strange also. I didn't. 

She started a hj and it seemed she wanted me to cum very quickly. I mentioned to her that she could slow down or go back to massage which she pretty much ignored. So I began to let my hands wonder. She has a cute black g string on and a very lovely shaved or waxed Pussy. She allowed me to touch for a few minutes or maybe moments before she kidna stopped. I asked her if she could take the g string off. Or suck. Or both. She said yes yes. How much. I gave her the remaining 15 in my wallet. Which she accepted. 

Then she said. She had to go for 3 minutes. To tell her friend something or get a tissue. Or something. But there were tissues already in the room. Anyway. After about 5 minutes. I was thinking oh. And looked at the clock. She returned 15 minutes later onto of the 5 at the start. She was gone about 20 minutes. She said sorry. She had a handful of tissues. 

She got naked. I touched and she played. I told her to slow down or massage again. She ignored. I came. I still had 10 minutes to go on my original 40. Plus the 20 she was missing. Is about 30 minutes I was genuinely still owed for my money. 

I didn't want to mention or argue or anything. I lay there for a few moments after I Cum. Thinking maybe she should sense that I could Cum again or wanted another massage for abit. She was just getting dressed and it seemed like I wasn't going to get any more massage or action. I got dressed. I left. 

Pretty shit. Haven't gone rnt in a long time and it's things like this that make me rather spend 250-350 for a hour with sex at a establishment.

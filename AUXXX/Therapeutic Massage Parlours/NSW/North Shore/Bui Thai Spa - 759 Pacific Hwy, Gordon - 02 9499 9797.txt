 New Thai Massage @ Gordon opening soon
				
Post Content: 
Hi All

Drove down the Pacific H'way yesterday & finally saw a painted sign on the front window (there's still newspaper covering up the works inside) advising Thai Day Spa & Massage opening soon.

I recall this being the site, just down from McDonalds , that had some grief with council DA last year, also it is opposite the old BRC @ Gordon.

Will be good to see what's on offer when they finally open, however maybe at first they may be "shy" so there's no issues with local council.

Cheers

Also as another punter noticed there is a DA approval for a Thai massage on the H'way at Lindfield. Haven't seen any sign yet but will kepp a look out.

The new place in Gordon is not the same place that had grief with Council. That place was one door to the North of McDonalds. I believe the new Thai place is a couple of doors to the South in what used to be a Dry Cleaners. I have a feeling in my bones that this place will be legit - and I hope I am proven wrong .

As for the potential new Lindfield place, I have been keeping a bit of an eye on it. There seems to be some construction activity there - but it is happening slowly. Occasionally, as I have been travelling by on the train, I have noticed the light in the stairwell is on. But the "For Lease" sign is still up on the awning.

Agree with EG, the new place at Gordon is the old dry-cleaners.

&& still waiting to "Leased" sign go up @ Lindfield, this place will be up above the H'way & from the train appears to be a large area for the shop...maybe many rooms with many choices 

Last time I was @ Lindfield Thai, the girl mentioned that the owners from there & North Sydney had parted ways & she was uncertain what was to become of 390 Pac Hway 

Interesting time ahead for out North Shore punters ...Happy Days !!

Oh fuck, another one. There's a new private Thai shop in the heart of Chatswood, also. Anyone have the Gordon number? The Chatswood number is 0406 351 435.

Altgourami, I believe this is the same phone # for "Mint" who's reviews appear in the Private Working Ladies tab.

No numbers displayed on the window @ Gordon as yet

there were 2 places at gordon couple of years back. one was up near the corner of st johns st above an indian dinner. it was full service. sometimes only one girl on if she was busy the old mamasan would wank you while you waited. it was cheap and dirty. cim was fine. anyway the council sicked the media onto the place and ran them out of town

I went to the Lindfield Thai place last Sunday (a review is in the works). But by chance, as I walked out of the shower, I saw the other two ladies (I had been with Tina), and neither of them looked familiar. Curiously, they were all wearing red dresses as opposed to the purple robes the ladies here used to wear. Maybe this reflects the change of management. I am still confused about the ownership structure of the Thai places. In the recent past I have seen:

Katie who tells me she also works at Artarmon and Poplar St (and who told me the Lindfield place had been sold,
And Cardia, who has been reviewed at Poplar St.

I think allegiances are very fluid in the Thai Massage world.

I have looked up the plans on Council's website. The new Gordon place will have 5 massage areas and a steam room. The massage areas are mostly separated by curtains. The place will be known as Bua Thai Massage and Day Spa. In the documentation, there is the list of services. Traditional Thai Massage $65/60 min, Aromatherapy oil Massage $90/60 mins and so on. They seem very well organised. Maybe this is another branch of an existing chain.

The plans on Council's website for the new Lindfield place show that it will be in the back half of the first floor. Three massage areas enclosed by solid partitions (that don't reach the ceiling). Doors rather than curtains are shown. It appears the main entry will be off the back lane.

'Enry, mate. I think not so promising. The price list and services sound a lot like the Naree Massage place in Hornsby. Here you can find the documentation. In the "documents" link, they have the list of services. It is a PDF of a photocopy. There is a watermark of some sort of flower. The whole place looks very Legit.

And remember, Ku-Ring-Gai council is the mob that closed down Butterfly across the road from this new place.

I have, of course, been wrong before. In the first half of 2009, on the way to Spoilers, I walked past a little Chinese Massage place several times. The list of services on the front window also looked very legit .....

From the carpark at the back it looks like the upstairs rooms are newly painted, here's hoping.

I was in Lindfield yesterday, and it looks like the 364 place is going full steam ahead. They have the lift installed to the back door (as shown on the plans), and everything is freshly painted. Now, the question is: How legit will it be??

Hey Guys,
I drove past this place on Mon, and the newspapers are off the windows.  It looks like it could be open.  Any takers yet?  I'll try it out asap.

EMP, I looked at the documentation they submitted to KuRingGai Council. The place seems to be disturbingly Legitimate.

See Here on the Council's website.

 Thai Massage - Pacific Hwy Gordon (next to Maccas)

This is the brand new place that was covered in newspapers until last week.  After my gangbang disaster tonight (see other thread in general discussions) I decide to TOFTT and try out this place.

As the old saying goes, if it looks like a pig, smells like a pig and grunts like a pig, then its a pig.  Well in this case, it looks LEGIT, it smells LEGIT, its cost structure is LEGIT and whaddya know, its fucking LEGIT.

Fully clothed but gorgeous Thai girl by the name of Lau took me to the small curtained off room (a row of them, all curtains) and told me to strip to undies.  She came back, stayed clothed the whole time, lots of towels covering EMPs bits, some oil, OK massage, not a fucking hint of tackle tickle AT ALL.  All up an enjoyable way to pass the hour, but not really VFM @ $70 for 60 (with oil, $50 without).  I wasn't game to ask for extras, there were  qualifications hanging on the wall, no shower (but nice dunny) and a well written letter saying if you ask for anything extra you'll be ejected.

Wont be back

EMP,

Thanks for TOFTT. This confirms my thoughts on this place. I had formed them based on the documentation submitted to Council in their DA. I had posted my thoughts somewhere - I think on AXR, but my old memory is failing me ...

Geez, ExMel, you're having a bad run of luck tonight! I'm hoping that things turn around in the best of ways for you and that you accidentally discover a new version of the old Albany - in the meantime, as EG says, thanks for TOFTT.

Matter of fact, I was thinking today that we should declare on month - maybe May? - to be 'TOFTT Month', when each punter tries out a different place, a new place - doesn't need to be totally new and untried, just different to the norm... but even if that did get off the ground, mate, I think after today's efforts you are granted a leave pass!

Yeah, thanks EMP... I too had doubts about here as it was setting up. Didn't realise it had actually opened. For relief, try a return across the road at the old BRC. They have some nice new lovelies. I'm just writing a review of my recent return there.

Now, a TOFTT month...? Faaarrrk... I thought that's what we do every month... LOL The problem will be to beat all you buggers to an unreviewed joint!!!

Tried this place last week. Agree that there were some very cute girls, and was hoping something might be on offer - but alas, it is legit. Dang

Address is 759 Pacific Hwy Gordon (one door south of Macdonalds). I think EMP has been there and reviewed.

I've been here twice now, my first review is in the silvers lounge.

I was in need of a decent massage on Thursday evening and did the maths along these lines.  A crap massage and FS for 1 hour at 533 or Pymble would be $160.  A great massage here for 1 hour plus 30 min fs at 533/Pymble would be $170 - so a no-brainer.  Rang ahead and booked, easy as.

As it turns out, I got the same girl as my first visit, strange name of Goah or something.  Very pretty thai lass.  Knowing that there would be no extras on the table didnt stop me from this time stripping to the birthday suit, just in case.  What followed was a 1 hour great thai massage that sorted all the knots in my shoulders and got rid of the headache - and absolutely no extras or even the hint of a tackle tickle.

$80 for 1 hour deep tissue massage with oil.  No showers here guys, and curtains only.  Also, quite a few ladies came and went for the massage - this is strictly legit, I'm sure.

I then went on for the punt at Pymble, which was a complete flop, but not for the reasons you thinking - you'll need to read the report

I had visited Whitworth's and noted the changes and investigated  the rest is history.

Services Provided : Massage Rnt.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes!!

My experience/comments :

Up the stairs and greeted by a smiling Yuki who was the only girl on at this time on the first morning. - I have met a great many Japanese over the years in all manner of places and scenarios and quickly found an easy rapport with this young lady. 

Had a quick look around the facilities (as described above) and retired to the large room with those enticing mirrored doors. We had a chat about the mirrors and what they might reflect, I explained the nature of the massage I wanted (it was greeted by a conspiring smile), and we both quickly fell into a state of complete undress with very little further communication.

She does have good English, lovely rounded body, is great company, to me, likes clambering around / over you (narrow tables), but all clean.  It was all a really unstructured encounter as we manoeuvred around the table with our eyes alternately on the mirrors, then on each other.

She was patient, because I was slow, had good technique, because I needed it, and one hour slipped by very quickly and successfully. Just ended up with a bit of a stiff neck not sure why? mirrors ?

All experiences are personal .. the old YMMV ..respect the boundaries, and if you don't enjoy her company perhaps it is a question of expectations. 

A respectful young lady, deserving of the same.

I might add that I was not the only customer here that morning, I was talking to the Mamasan for some time, and at least three other punters visited the shop, so there are other potential reports out there somewhere..!1??

Would I return?  Most certainly for her, it was fun, and to check out who else is on the roster. A mixture of Chinese and Japanese I believe,- I have some clues.!!!

Person's Name : Hanna

Establishment : Crows Nest Relaxation Massage 

Date of Visit : 14/6/2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Crows Nest Relaxation Massage. 47a Alexander St. Crows Nest. Phone: 0410 699 096

Hours of Business : 10am - 8 7 Days.

Rates : 30 - $40 / 45 - $? / 60 - $65 plus. +30 for topless tug painters were in the house

Age : early 20s

Size/shape : Slim, lovely firm C cups, pretty face, her teeth are a little crooked - only blemish on this lass 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese - Yokohama

Services Provided : Massage Rnt.

Value for money/recommend? : Massage no - Tug yep

My experience/comments :

Went up the stairs following the lights and met at reception by Hanna. Now Hanna was wearing day clothes with a very short skirt and I thought wow nice was my first impression. She said that she was the only one available and that she had a booking in 40 minutes, would 30 be OK? Said sure a bit disappointed at first but later after the massage glad it was only 30. She directs me through the curtains to the right of the reception desk and the room on the right, tells me to strip and get on the table. I do so and she joins me as I am laying down on the table. She asks if I would like a firm massage and I say yes please. The massage is not in anyway firm at all, very soft and just a bit of pushing the oil around the body. Hanna is however very nice and chatty and pleasant to be with. After a 15 minutes of this rubbish massage I asked if there was anything else on offer and she said the usual $20/$50, I wanted to see her naked and took the $50 option and then she said told that the painters were in and since I had been nice she would strip leaving just her undies on for $30. I agreed as I thought this was very fair. Also liked that she was up front with this and that she offered a discount instead of pocketing the full $50 - YMMV with this as we seemed to hit it off nicely. No TT just turnover please as she stripped to reveal a nice, firm young Japanese body, would love to see her naked and do more - which isn't on offer. She oiled up little C and asked how I like to be tugged, fast and firm, slow etc. Told her how I liked it and she obliged starting nice and slow with great 2 handed technique - knows how to play with a cock that is for sure. She was in no rush to get me spurting, but was definitely getting me to the brink before slowing back down again, meanwhile my hands were gently playing with her nice young firm breasts. I queried if I could suck on them and she said only her boyfriend was allowed to do that with a blush - damn lucky bastard - this is also the reason other things are not on offer, bloody BF. She continued the tug and it was just before time was up that she upped the ante and I spurted a big pile of goo everywhere. She finished the tug and then cleaned me up with the tissues and wet wipes. While we were dressing I asked about her boyfriend and he knows nothing about what she is doing here or that she even works here. She told me during the massage that she will be heading back to Japan next week - damn - but will be trying to get a new visa to return to OZ in a couple of months as she loves it here.

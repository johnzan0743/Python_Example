 2 Memorial Ave, St Ives
				
Post Content: 
I was searching around the web the other day and found a recently approved DA on Ku-ring-gai Council's website for the extension of the hours of a Thai Massage shop at 2 Memorial Ave St Ives (just around the corner from Denly Lane) from a 7 pm closing to a 9 pm closing. Thai massage - closing late - possibly a shop of interest. I did a "stroll by" yesterday. It has a distinct look of legitimacy about it, the signs out the front, the reception desk and so on. I think not "our sort of place". Very much in the mould of the one next to McDonalds in Gordon ...

Hmm.. intriguing..

May need to get a late evening massage and quietly explore how legit it is.
Could be a relative of the one you mentioned in Gordon which is legit.

THe original DA for the place next to Macca's was for a FS shop think and there was a hell of a reaction to that. It was idiotic even to try IMHO as next door to a Ronald McD where kids frequent would not be correct.

The one in Memorial is next to the new wine bar  so pretty visible even though it is well served by car park. The Denley Lane place is highly visible and so exposed you would have to come from well out of the area to visit. Wo8uld be better if they erected a canvas screen to cover the stairs and the entrance as lots of cars go head down there to access the carpark.

Agree
It's probably one of the worse places to set up a 'shop'.
The whole shopping village is really a mess and should be bulldozed and started over from scratch. I am in the area and its  a mall  I try and avoid. 
 The Denley shop is tricky as its very exposed. I was there twice, and ran into someone I knew coming out, so won't go there again.

But looking for a legit massage might give this place a shot.

The application for the FS shop next to McDonalds was on the Northern (Pymble) side. It was upstairs and access was going to be from the lane near the carpark at the back. From memory, the applicant was the operators of the Aromas chain of shops. This site is now used for something else - a beautician, I think. The legit Thai place is on the opposite side of Maccas at street level in the shop that used to be a dry cleaner.

Areas frequented by kids is a favourite of Councils for refusing brothels. Bodyrotic had two DA's in Five Dock (one for their original Garfield Rd site, one for a proposed new site) knocked back on reasons that seemingly boiled down to: "There can be a lot of kids in the Five Dock business district ...". Yet 104 Pacific Hwy Roseville has been operating legally since 1999 (and illegally for some (many?) years before that) a few doors from the Roseville Cinema - surely a place kids frequent. And seemingly doing so without causing any problems ...

that denly lane is still going with no council action is amazing, not so long ago a r&t in st ives would have been a scandal for the local times to put on the front page. any more competition in st ives would be too much i think and the attack dogs from the council will act

Won't be back unless they get desperate!

JB1 Brave lad indeed!
Bit pricy for an hour isn't it?

I was planning this Sunday to check this place out. But now sounds like i will try and see Sandy at Pretty Baby or lovely Nicole at 104 Hampden.
Cant go into Denly shop, too many familiar faces wandering around.

Person's Name: Suki

Establishment : Albany st massage

Date of Visit: friday 19 march 2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 2, 1-5 Albany St, Crows Nest

Hours of Business: dunno

Rates: $60 hour/ $35 half for straight massage - $100/60 for naked

Age: late 20s???

Size/shape: tiny - gorgeous body, nice big enhanced tits

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided: light massage, Condom BJ, hand relief

Value for money/recommend?: Suki is a cutie

My experience/comments: 

The new management at Albany St seem to have the erotic massage business model working in conjunction with normal massage. Hope posting here does not blow their cover.

Suki, who I saw, only works on Friday. If you like a small Asian woman with a nice little body and excellent tits I recommend her. Her massage is very light except when she massages your head - as in the one with your brain in it. Wait - I mean the one with 2 eyes a nose and a mouth. The massage frankly is pretty ordinary to weak.

Suki does not allow pussy touching. Suki does an excellent condom BJ for a little extra $20. English is OK and I enjoyed her service. I blew my balls off when she sucked me.

Business seems to have picked up as I heard the bell ring a few times when I was there. I am wondering if certain ladies may provide FS but Suki said No when I asked ... 2 times .... as I fancied fucking her gorgeous little body but she's not there for that.

Value for money/recommend? Maybe...

My experience/comments:

Walked in after reading about the place on auxxxreviews. Was greeted by Lisa (initially thought she said her name was Noosa, then Loosa, on reflection I think it must have been "Lisa" she was saying with thick accent). Taken upstairs to massage table hidden behind thin curtains. Proceeded to get ok massage. Made the mistake of saying "Yes" to the "your first time here" question, which I think sunk any changes of anything non-legit occurring. Not that I was that keen to try for anything with only curtains between me an the rest of the world! Half way through the massage I start hearing very non-massagy sounds coming from elsewhere in the premises  5 minutes before the end of the massage Lisa over in to sensual massage mode, and promises "better service" on next visit.

Left well massaged but with blue balls (see reports to follow). On way out met Selina, who was good looking and cheeky enough to make me reconsider my aversion to thin curtains. I'm sure curiosity will bring me back next time I'm up in SinCity (just as well I don't live there, otherwise I'd be broke... but very happy!)

shhhhh. I say nothing. I realise this business is not advertising here anymore ... but.... I went here during the week as it is easy for me to get to.

All I can say is that when I walked in the door and saw the 2 sexy chinese MILFs look at me I knew there was something goin' on here.

I was the only punter there. Chose the hour massage for $100. From the moment I came in and the chineeesseeee pussssyyyy MILF I chose (sorry forgotten name) teased my cock I knew it was ON. 

Then .... another punter comes in and choses 30 minutes. I know because i could hear every word as I lay there.

Within2 minutes I hear sucking and slurping. Some chinnneeeeesssseeeee puuusssyyyy was sucking that punter's cock wasn't she. Or so I thought.

Won't go into details of what I got up to for an extra $50 but it involved chhinnneeeesseeee puuusssssyyyy. fucking awesome dude.

Person's Name: Julie

Establishment : Albany st massage

Date of Visit: Tuesday Jun 2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 2, 1-5 Albany St, Crows Nest

Rates: $60 1/2, +$50 bbbj and fs

Age: early 30s?

Size/shape: skinny, hardly any tits, small nips, partly shaved, big pussy lips

Nationality or Ethnicity: Not sure

Services Provided: massage, bbbj, fs

Value for money/recommend?: Sort of...

My experience/comments: 

Was walking past so I thought I would pop in. I have only been here once before and I wasn't too keen on the curtained layout but I thought I would try to go upstairs. 

Walked in and there were two older looking ladies sat at reception. One immediately ushered me upstairs and when in the room gave me a hug. I gave her a quick feel of her tits so she knew what I wanted. I got the impression that anything was on offer. 

She took my $60 and then left. She was replaced by Julie, described above. Nice friendly girl who said she'd been working there 6 months. Who knows really? She stripped off immediately and started feeling my cock, so things were definitely on. I asked her if she would give me a bj, to which she said, "you want sex? $50." No beating about the bush with this chick. 

Money changed hands, started with bbbj, slow but not deep. I got in trouble for pushing her head down, hehe. She was laughing though so she clearly wasn't too bothered. On the table for mish sex which went on for a few minutes. 

All the time I kept getting these funny smells that reminded me of rotten fish. Hmmm...anyway, she turned around for doggy and then it hit me. Rotten fish. Instant erection killer. I've never smelled anything like it in my life. Quickly turned her over again and shot my load. 

Then had a poky, stabby sort of massage that took up another 10 minutes. 

When we were done she just got dressed again, clearly no intention of having a shower at all. And this was in the morning, imagine late afternoon! Went home and scrubbed myself all over. 

I think I'll give the Asians a miss for a while and concentrate on some Aussie/European chicks at AH and The Boardroom. More $$ but at least they'll be clean.

As much as I like CP (Chinese Pussy), I agree that sometimes the Asian experience is a little too scripted. You kinda know what you are going to get every time. Last year had a great massage with an aussie chick and we ended up talking for 20 minutes after about what she was doing on the weekend and stuff. Much better personal experience.

It's official. I cannot organise a root in a brothel.

Popped in today and met Linda who is a Chinese MILF. $60 for half hour very good massage. She really does know how to massage. I heard her take off her clothes just before i was asked to flip. She offered straight up FS for $50 and i said Yes. Then proceeded this problem where she did not have a condom so she called out to the other girl in Chinese for one. But a conversation ensued and of course I have no idea what was said but no condom emerged. I have no idea if the other woman told her to get her own, or maybe said we shouldn't do FS here or what but no FS eventuated. 

So Linda proceeded without missing a beat to BBBJ and HJ with touching. It was good. After I asked how much as she said $30. Linda works Tuesday and Sunday. Linda is prob mid-late 30s with a bit of a belly and plumpish hips but nice enough and English OK.

I think I need to get a new job that is further away from this place. I keep going there as it just convenient.

Popped in this afternoon as frankly I needed to unload a build up of excessive sperm ! Its been at least a week since I had a root.

I did have a shoulder injury due to my misconceived notion that I can still play golf. On entry met a MILF. I'll be polite as say she was over 30 but I think 30 may be the new 40 if you know what I mean. Shi-shi(?) only works Monday.

What followed was seriously one excellent massage- deep and thorough and worked my aching muscles. Shi-shi knew what she was doing. Flip over and she offers FS for $50. I did not want that and asked for BJ. Said $40 for CBJ. As I was just there to unload I did not haggle although I know going price is $20 -$30 for BBBJ. Proceeded with CBJ and when she got bit of jaw lock I encouraged her to move on to HJ. Shi-shi did this with some degree of exasperation about how long I was taking as I was just enjoying the moment. Eventually I did unload the excess and quite a lot of it and she looked pleased with the end result. 

Funny thing is Shi-shi was friendly and nice before and after except she looked so bored while executing the core of our liaison. For an older woman nice body with small handful boobs and quite nice body with tiny tummy bump. I liked her and enjoyed the experience. But really I should get out more !

Haven't been punting due to a variety of factors, I decided to reacquaint myself with my previous hobby - Punting! Decided to ease myself into it and since never been here after the chance in management, decided to give it a shot.

My visist pre-changeover were pretty good - had a lot of good memories and the rush of being given [insert]  behind the curtained off areas had the heart pumping good.

Noting the reviews, I hoped the new management would have mellowed and be able to offer something along the lines that it used to.

Saw Marie(?) last thursday - 30ish asian loday. THe massage was ok imo, enough to work out the kinks but not hard enought for me to be happy with it. I thought this place might have turned into a legit massage joint, but when I turned over, she whispered to me whether I wanted a tug - negotiated a price of $20. THe tug was ordinary and way too much oil.  ??? afterwards, she indicated that she give a  better service if I come back next time...

Not sure if I'll be back, but as I left, there was another good looking lady...

Might come here for a legit massage, but anything extras...will depend

Went there a couple of weeks ago, met by the Mamasam who asked if I had been there before and was very cagey in what types of massage were on offer, but gave lots of hugs and took me to a curtained off massage bed on the ground floor, no upstairs for me this time.
Had a pretty average massage from a Middle aged Chines lady with about 3 words of English, and for whom the Mamasam kept coming in to translate. that really helped while I was but naked on the table, at one point I had two of them over me having a conversation. the RNT was average, and she kept her uniform on, but raised her skirt!!. The RNT was interrupted by another masseur popping her head around the corner with money in her hand for a conversation in Chinese presumably about their splits of the takings.
Finished and left with a few more english words from the masseur to find out if I was married, she introduced herself but I was too busy leaving to remember her name.
Forget Chinese Go Thai every time they are so much better.

So, technically 1-5 Albany is St Leonards (but only about 100 m or so)

October 25th, 2012 Midday.

Establishment and/or person's Name: Melissa and Rose

Hours of Business: (if known or applicable) 10am-7pm

Prices: 30 $60, extra $20 for CBJ

Age: 35+

Size/shape: Slim, Chinese

Services: body massage+cbj

Value for money/recommend?:Yes, 

My experience/comments: Havent been here for a long time, 12 months maybe. I used to really enjoy visiting Rose on a Sunday afternoon, but some of their mid-week girls just didnt do it for me and I ended up going to Herbert St for a while....well, yesterday Herbert St was busy when I wanted to go...so.....

Melissa was on, looks quite reasonable in the tight red dress - I note sadly they seem to have gone away from the faux-professional white nurse outfits.

The draw back of this place is that it is a small commercial shop with nothing but curtains as walls, and you can hear other punters getting a massage, and vice versa obviously.....

Took me upstairs, paid, laid down and started to get a fairly average massage. That might be her skill speaking or me running my fingers over her pussy lightly distracting from the job at hand.....massage went on for a while, this lass is older than 35, but in pretty good shape for that age bracket - badly enhanced rack though. Long black hair. Nice legs with perfectly smooth skin. 

While she's rubbing my back her pussy is an inch from my face, and I decide to do something that is very rare for me at these places...when it was time to roll over I stood up, sat her on the bench and DATY was on..I think she liked it as whilst I intimated I wanted a bj, Melissa seemed (english not her first language), to be suggesting a fuck was a far better idea, and I got the impression the fuck would be gratia. I'll never know because for the extra $20 I got the CBJ. Nice, hot mouth, really slow and deliberate sucking. A little hand/ball action to go with it. Odd, because I usually like a little more activity, but yesterday the slow and deliberate approach seemed just right.

Got off, got wiped down and Melissa was all over me like a cheap suit, kisses and declarations of desire to see me again, usual thing. I get the distinct impression there is a lot more on the menu with Melissa than a $20 CBJ and a vanilla fuck, but we shall see. 

I was really pleased to see Rose there again, and she remembered me too which was nice. She's put on a few kilo's over the past 12-18 months, but havent we all......

I have ventured back into this place over the past few weeks, and while there are no Mina's or Wendy's (sigh), it is back to the old business.

Saw a withered old crow on Thursday in the white uniform, $60 for nude HJ and massage 30 minutes, offered CBJ for $30 and FS for $50, declined.

She was keen to make long lsting friends it seems and encouraged me to come back and see her.

Saw the smoking manager on the way out, I'd be back just for her.

Sunday I dropped back in, this time a smiling lovely young thing in a leopard print top and black skirt greated me, lots of fun and romance before we got behind the curtain.

She did not ask me what sort of massage, just went straight to sensual, got her top off and fingers wet, all quite good really, certainly for $60.

The shower is not in use so do not count on that.

All good really, I may have to pop back some time again soon.

 Albany St Crows Nest Massage
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Melissa

Establishment : Albany St Crows Nest

Date of Visit : 20 June 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Albany Street Crows Nest

Hours of Business : probably standard 

Rates : $60/30mins plus $50 for CBJ, FS

Age :40ish

Size/shape : very slim / 160cm / size 6 / Pert B Cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, CBJ, FS

Value for money/recommend? : Yes 


My experience/comments: 

My first time to this shop and was greeted by pretty hot sexy manager? who ushers me upstairs. She gives me a hug and a smack on the bum, great sexy attitude! I'm thinking it's my lucky day!!! I undress and lie down and she slides her hands from lower back up to my shoulder then presses down on my back with her breasts leans in to me so her hair is cascading down over my head and kisses the back of my neck. Feels damn hot - great start anyway. So as the massage starts I take note the curtained layout provides no sound proofing whatsoever. So 5 minutes into the massage there's talking in chinese between the curtains and another older ML comes in and takes over. Although a bit annoying this is happening, after 30 seconds I don't mind so much as s begins even better and harder massage and great TT followed by a turnover order where she offers everything for $50 which I can't resist. Although she's not the prettiest or youngest shes got a great tight body and great pert tits with nice long nipples and a real nice shaved smooth groove. She gives a great slow sucking cbj and doms up  then jumps on board and rides for a good while, then she finishes off with a great hj. 

In summary:  Pros- VFM $110 massage cbj and fs with tight bodied friendly naughty asian milf.  Cons: Curtained layout, too dark, didn't partake in DATY

Rose  - Mamasan

Rose has retired and SOLD the shop - last drinks were Thursday. Per chance I was exiting the St Leonards station, just prior to 10am, as Rose was walking out.

I walked with her up to Albany St - she told me she had sold the shop and today (Thurs) was last day ...  new owner would take over perhaps with new girls.

I had seen Rose (and some others) a few times in the past and Rose does do a great / erotic HJ including reach through (with me nose down and arse up) !!
I wanted a memeorable last visit and got it ... She will be missed, great attitude and although a MILF shop , it was often a rewarding visit here ,,,, Bearing in mind its past legends.

Today it was closed for "renovations/alterations" due to open tomorrow !! .. Perhaps new (and yet unknown) legends await !!!

All new girls .. All young - and here's the Rub (no pun intended) quite a few will be / are young Japanese girls of varying skiil levels - so training may be interesting.

This is NOT an AR on my experience - that will follow as I am getting behind with a few.
BUT, I did venture in on Saturday morning and Got Pole Position -
In fact I tried 'em BOTH - One After The Other - Both Japnese girls - Erica (Okinawa) and Mika (Osaka)

Genuine Japanese girls and Mamasan Miki, because she speaks Japanese, said she can talk to girls easily !!

As hard says, part of the "feel" of the (pre 2011) place was the sound carrying over (or through) the curtains, the giggles, and the occasional need to be vewwy vewwy quiet when one of the occasional lady customers turned up ...

OK Mamasan Miki is Chinese but lived in Japan for several years and speaks Japanese, girls are all young Japanese students.

Went yesterday but didn't want the girls, Sparksy wanted the Mamasan Miki and after a bit of negotiation got her 

Miki showed me a price list and I picked the 30min prostate massage at $55 WTF the price list is strange, I think the normal 30 min price is $45. Anyway into the room and a reasonable erotic massage followed. Off with the clothes for an additional toll of $40 and a lovely little size 5 Miki was naked in front of me. I sucked on her tiny titties while Miki did her stuff and a satisfactory end followed.

Look the prices are higher than most Chinese places but if you are after a young Japanese student to have some fun with this may be worth it

enjoy

Person's Name : Yoko

Establishment : 2/1-5 Albany St Crows Nest

Date of Visit : 12/11/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0403 114 291

Hours of Business : 

Rates : $75/60min

Age : Mid 20's

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

Services Provided : Massage only

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : I finished work early this afternoon so I thought I'd give this place a go, considering it was under new management, and the thought of a young Japaneses girl giving me a sensual and erotic massage, my mind was racing. I was introduced to Yoko and she looked very fine indeed, so when she asked how long I'd like to stay I immediately opted for the hour.... $75 she says. $75 I thought... I hope this is good.... I stripped off and lay on the table and Yoko soon made an appearance, we made some small talk in English then, as I can speak some Japanese, in Japanese. She was impressed that I could talk with her in her native language and I thought that this would auger well for later. She asked how I'd like my massage? medium I replied. So then what commenced was the most half hearted excuse for a massage I've ever had... Very soft fingers just running up and down my back with no real pressure, then more of the same on my legs. Never once was there any hint of some tackle tickle or even a light brush of her fingers near my never regions. I suppose though it was relaxing in a way and I can assure you however that my bits were very relaxed. Half an hour in it was turn over time... and my penis looked like my local rolled up newspaper, which had been lying in the rain all night, all soggy and limp and not something one might want to play with. Yoko massaged my front with the same lack of enthusiasm as my back. After about 45 minutes I thought of just getting up and leaving but I didn't and stayed to the end. After 60 minutes she told me that my massage had finished and asked if I'd like a hot towel, which I accepted. She left while I got dressed and I never saw her again, no goodbyes or anything. Walking back to my car I couldn't help wondering if I had insulted her in some way... although I always go out of my way to be polite and respectful... Did I fart or something??

Just be more upfront with what you want, there is PLENTY of fun to be had at this place. If the first one doesn't comply, ask to speak to another, I can vouch for the mamasan Miki so you won't have to feel funny asking the questions, she knows full well how this all works. I agree though massage will be hit and miss, so wouldn't suggest going there if that's what you REALLY want.

Was passing and was in need of a massage so I thought I would try this place.

The girl who answered my call had to ask a colleague about time that the shop closed and also the price as it was all changing - as I later found out.

When I arrived, there were two young good looking slim ML one from China and one from Japan plus a Chinese male.

I had a one hour massage in one of the upstairs rooms.

I will not say who the ML girl was as I do not want to get her into trouble.

This is a new shop and is the sister show of one in Burwood and one in Hurlstone Park ( could be wrong about this one).

The shop has been open less than a week, and although there was a box of tissues and wet wipes on the stand apparently they do not do extras, although "the Boss" has said they do not have to do anything they do not want to do.

Their prices have come down from $75 to $65 hour because of a long line of pissed off customers who have participated of the previous owners services but come here to find No HJ / B2B /or anything else.

A number of ML girls have also left as they have been pestered and shouted at by punters wanting more. They have been referring them to the Thai shops nearby.

I think the owner needs to address this reasonably quickly with better promotion of what services they do so the staff are not hassled or the punters pissed off and waisting their money.

I think a phone call up front from any punter to ascertain what might be on offer would be a good idea.

Otherwise lovely clean shop, great ML's and great massage.

Just to add a bit of complexity to the whole equation I had an ams message with photo from Albany massage last night saying All Japanese masseurs full body oil massages $60 hour etc - so maybe they are listening to what the punters are saying - maybe it is time to pop back and see what their latests offering is? Maybe I should not be using my mobile to ring them :-)

Yep, I can confirm that there are J girls there. And some China dolls as well. Depends on the day.
Young girls (students mostly) and what is on offer is nowhere near what it used to be, but having a young J girl serving you  herbal tea is sometimes enough 

The mamasan, Miki is Chinese and she's upgraded the place nicely, actual walls and all 

The kind of debauchery that was the lure of the old Albany is there no more, it's been replaced with fresh faces and a sense of innocence (appearances can be deceiving).

I repeat my information of November last year and add that there are about 8 J girls that I have met, a couple of Chinese, a couple of Taiwanese and HK.
That is why I suggested some distinction be made between this NEW BUSINESS and the OLD Albany thread which is long gone !!!

I also pointed out that the phone number at the top of this thread is not correct - the number is 0413 199 355  and the landline is 80406938 !!!!!

2/1-5 THE NEW ALBANY ST, St Leonards. (0403 114 291)

MODS - Is this in Order? - to Just suggest that we create a new thread for this Massage shop .. aka .."NEW ALBANY ST" ??

Same premises, etc, HOWEVER - Its a new business .. extensive renovations - NO CURTAINS - 3 massage rooms with floor to ceiling walls with doors, two
 upstairs and one down.

New Mamasan - very young - Miki, Chinese ,, (Also speaks Japanese and good English)
 All new girls .. All young - and here's the Rub (no pun intended) quite a few will be / are young Japanese girls of varying skiil levels - so training may be interesting.

This is NOT an AR on my experience - that will follow as I am getting behind with a few.
 BUT, I did venture in on Saturday morning and Got Pole Position -
 In fact I tried 'em BOTH - One After The Other - Both Japnese girls - Erica (Okinawa) and Mika (Osaka)

Genuine Japanese girls and Mamasan Miki, because she speaks Japanese, said she can talk to girls easily !!

Ok - Initial Intel over and 2 TOFTS completed

I was walking into Crows Nest this morning from St Leonards and having read the above decided to pop in and ask Miki, the Mamasan, for some edification.

The story is that they were ALL Police Officers (6), (massive overkill, as usual) and that they were there as the result of some complaint, by a masseuse, against a customer who allegedly committed some form of "offence" against her two days previously. 

Mamasan, knew of no complaint, nor does she allege the unknown customer did anything, the Police made their enquiries and left satisfied with the answers, the masseuse was not present.

The masseuse no longer works there and I do not know who she is.

I used to punt there very regularly, when it first opened, it is one of 4 shops owned, or in some partnership, by the owner (Ken) of 185a in Burwood.

I saw some very pretty, if inexperienced, Japanese girls back then, most have long since departed these shores.

I was told by one of the girls, who has been there since last year, that it is reasonably busy with regulars, so it appears to be doing quite well.

Nice work in trying to find out the actual event!!
No disrespect to TIP but something just does not seem right with the Mamasan's response. Why would 6 officers come 2 days later for a complaint from the ML which the managers do not even know about. Even with domestic violence I doubt the police would come straight away with any more than 2 officers.
It sounds like if the customer acutally committed an offence and the manager does not know then it could not be that serious, assuming the mamasan's story is true.
Logically it just does not add up.

The process was  1 female Immigration officer went in and then came out waited for police officers to arrive and then all went in. Shop closed embarrassed punter came out. I think they are trying to make the situation less than it was. Drove past yesterday light on so shop working - good luck to them

With 533 getting raided not so long ago in which they were targeting a girl who was staying illegally in Australia, I would assume it was something very similar and nothing to do with an abusive customer.

Post Content: 
Person's Name : Ai

Establishment : 2/1-5 Albany St Crows Nest

Date of Visit : Nov 14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0403 114 291

Hours of Business : Till 9PM I think.

Rates : $40/30 massage + $50 nude +HJ

Age : "Its a secret" but my guess early 20s.

Size/shape : 5' 2", long dark hair, awesome ass, quite pretty, hairy puss. 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

Services Provided : Massage +

Value for money/recommend? : Jury's out. 

Visited today and saw a delectable little Japanese girl called AI, yes that's how you spell it. Very poor English but an absolutely smoking body and long dark hair. Now I asked was she shaved and quick as a flash she said "Yes", which turned out to be a complete brazen lie because she was quite hairy down there. All this took place before the negotiations, which was for an additional $50, nude and HJ. It was also $40 for the massage that I didn't end up getting. 

Now normally I would have balked at an extra $50 just to get her kit off, hj and for "light pussy touching, outside only" but she was smoking hot so I coughed up. 

So kit off and what a bod the girl has. Got my hand between her legs and she was as wet as, absolutely dripping, presumably from all the other horny punters before me. She really was getting pretty horny as I rubbed her soaking wet pussy and believe me, I tried, and tried for more, but she was having none of it. She also allowed me to suck on her bulging rock hard nipples which was quite nice. 

Her HJ was slow and deliberate and as I was so bloody horny she managed to get me over the line with ease. 

Normally I'd say 'not worth the $$' but maybe, just maybe she might crack? She certainly was genuinely horny, god knows how she resists. 

She works Sat + Sun I think, but with her poor English everything was a bit vague. Can't attest to her massage skills because I didn't get any.

Should have also said; I wasn't offered a shower either before or after.

Hours of Business :	10am till 9pm 7 days
Rates :	$40 (30 minutes) / $55 (45 minutes) / $65 (60 minutes
Age :	looked 25 to me but not sure!  An Asian's age can be hard to pick
Size/shape :	C cup, 5'5" or so, average build
Nationality :	Japanese
Services Provided :	Massage and HJ
Value for money/recommend? : Yes indeed
My experience/comments :
Spur of the moment choice to pop in here  on opening the door, was greeted by a Japanese looking receptionist who lead me into one of the 2 upstairs and rather claustrophobic rooms.  A masseuse soon joined me  no chose your masseuse here it seems.
Still Rita seemed quite pleasant and I have a soft spot for Asian especially Japanese, women.
Asked to stay for 45 minutes  as I find 30 minutes too short to relax and too pressurised to get onto business.  At my age, I take a little longer to get to the destination.  Rita invied me to take all off and she'd be back  a promising start I thought.
Massage was quite quite good in itself but from a TT and teasing  point of view it was quite basic and perfunctory bordering on non existent.  However Rita was very personable and friendly so that aspect was very good
After 25 minutes or so, she popped the Q to which I said yes reluctantly given my disappointment at the lack of TT etc.  Usual rate - $50 for nude HJ
She slipped off a pair of shorts and top to reveal a magnificent set of boobs I think the fines I'vve seen in a very long while. Large, round, sitting up perfectly, natural and with gorgeous perky nipples. Inquired if I might touch to be told no problem.  Magnificent bum as well.
HJ was well done though I struggled to pop even though I was close a few times. Rita was not at all concerned that I might be taking awhile and said so without prompting. She was willing to be coached on tips and tricks  I don't think she's been doing erotic massage for long.
Eventually popped followed by a loving luxurious wipe down and clean up.

Conclusion :
I'll definitely be back to see her  she's very friendly and willing and I think would improve with subsequent visits.
Highly recommended but as always, YMMV

Well well, on my way to road test 6/38-46 Albany Street and I parked up the road opposite this place. Initially confused thinking it was 6/38 but then discovered that it was a different shop. Quick googling on the phone turned up nothing and a search of AXR showed me nothing quickly. Then discovered this thread today.
Reasonable punt, might not be back though. 

Here is a photo I snapped of it.





Person's Name : 
Doesn’t have an English name, her Japanese name sounds like “She-oh-lee”

Establishment : 
Albany Massage JapaneseStyle

Date of Visit : 
Thursday 7/Apr/2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 
8040 6938 or 0413 199 335
2 / 1 Albany St, St Leonards
Managed to google their webpage, it’s one of the weirder ones, and I’ve seen some fucking weird shop pages: Albany Massage JapaneseStyle Home

Hours of Business : 
10am-9pm 7-days

Rates : 
30m $40
45m $55
60m $65 (what I picked after initially going the 45m option)

$20 tug, $50 nude tug

Age : 27, I believe her

Size/shape : 8-10, about 160cm. Bad typical Japanese crooked teeth (but of a turnoff for me). B-C cups, fairly perky. Pear shaped with a big rump. Half blond hair. Shaved

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese, from near Tokyo 

Services Provided : so so massage (typical jap a bit too soft for me). Nude HJ. Access most areas.

Value for money/recommend? : on the balance, probably not. Could be a gold mine if you can find the right girl.

My experience/comments : 
Entrance is very out in the open. Even mid-afternoon there is plenty of cars waiting for the lights onto Pacific Highway, so it’s difficult to manage covertly. Picked a quiet moment and headed into the shop. Just the one girl on the couch and she showed me up the stairs. Initial impressions are ok, and we get to the top of their stairs and there is a very loud conversation happening behind one of the paper-thin walls. Quite a few “No Sexual Services” signs around the place, but we all know what that really means  

Sheolee asks me how long, collected the $55 for 45m and then tells me to undress and get on the table. Which I do while Sheolee gets my change. Table is really thin, barely wider than my shoulders. But it’s otherwise very clean with a disposable covering. Sheolee comes back and starts the massage, checking to make sure the pressure isn’t too much. It’s not too much, it’s a typical softer Japanese style (prefer a sold Thai massage myself).

Sheolee is a great talker actually, probably the highlight of the visit having a good conversation. She’s 27, has been in Aus 2 years and at this shop for 6 months or so. We chat about everything, her English is good, but some things are hard to understand. Massage continues without the slightest hint of tackle tickle, hard to even have MiniMaid exposed and my legs apart on the super thin table. Eventually the 45min massage time is up, and I ask her about extras. $20 tug and $50 for the take off, but I also need to pay the extra $10 as time is up. Ok, no worries. She collects $10 from my initial change and goes downstairs.

She’s back up quickly and nudes up. Body is so so…. A lot was hidden behind the clothes. HJ starts while I’m face down and it’s very very good as she slowly builds me to getting very horny. Turn over and my hands are free to roam while the HJ builds in intensity. Sheolee is happy to let me explore her exteriors, but I don’t really try to go much further. 10m into the HJ and I blow my load everywhere. Clean up is very professional with tissues and baby-wipes, which are all cleaned up and disposed of in the temporary table covering. 

I pay the $50, tip her the rest of the change $5 and head out the door. Probably won’t be back here to see Sheolee, there are plenty of other options around. But if you like genuine Japanese and that style of massage, it might be worth a visit.

Could very well be, that's similar to what it sounds like.

SPRUNG! I was actually after on of the un-reviewed Koreans listed in their roster. Figured I'd road test.

Haven't yet had the pleasure of seeing Emma, but Serenity was one of my very first punts after poping my cherry at Apple Massage Neutral Bay (now closed).... Saw the explosive Monica

Mega, this place next to the Trinity Apartments is the original amazing Albany Street 'massage' joint from many years ago, when it was run by Mina, now of Hornsby. Mina was quite the MILFY minx, employed great ladies and while there was a pretence of massage for some female clientele, for most of us regulars (and quite a few here were) the massage was either incidental, foreplay or skipped entirely in favour of FS.

I had some of my raunchiest 'massage' experiences there, including a double with Mina and a buxom Asian lass whose name escapes me but was/is the squeeze of Old & Bald, plus some great after-hours sessions (last appointment of the day) with Mina.

Sadly, after she left the new owners could never keep up such high standards, and nobody has done so here since.

Well spotted, Chalk - but was in fact browsing at that BoDesign store on the corner ahead of giving the apartment an interior refresh. Long gone are the days I'd be parked outside Albany for a late evening booking and bonking with Mina!

Person's Name : Amy

Establishment : Albany Massage JapaneseStyle

Date of Visit : 24 June 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 8040 6938 or 0413 199 335  2 / 1 Albany St, St Leonards

Hours of Business : 10am-9pm 7-days

Rates : 30m $40;45m $55 ;60m $65 

$20 tug, $50 nude tug

Age : looks mid 20s

Size/shape : 8-10, about 165cm tall for a Japanese, pretty busty for me would say a C plus?

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese, Tokyo 

Value for money/recommend? : Yes I guess

My experience/comments : 

Massage consisted of little technique but was relaxing enough for me, only complaint is if it did last longer.

Work has got the better of me, and rarely do i have chance to visit RNTs these days. Was late evening finishing work, and wandered to the St Leonards area, gone in and went with Amy, who was in black pantyhose, was a turn on for me.

To describe her, she has quite big eyes, reasonably tall for a Jap, young in her mid 20s, and I find her face attractive too. These days it is increasingly difficult to find good looking asian MLs on the north shore.

She is not afraid to talk, and we conversed a bit around the general stuff, rather quickly (i opted for 30min), she asked if i wanted extra and i said yes please.

Definitely no tease during the massage, but I was having balls full so it didn't take too long for her to bring me up whilst slowing playing with my balls and stroking.

When she got me up, I asked if she would give me a foot job instead, she seemed confused at first and did not know what I was saying, and after a bit of explaining she was OK with it.

She had rather big feet, and felt good with the black pair of pantyhose! Rubbing, stroking all with her feet and I signalled to her i was coming and it all happened all over her hands.

She also did mention she was going to a bar in Crows Nest after work, which is where the Japs tend to hang around, I assume the bars in the Crows Nest area would be a good pick up joint for those who have the time to invest.

Overall, I'm satisfied with the session but the time was cut short, I made a call before i got in, and finished, walked out in exactly 20min. No wonder why the massage felt so short.
Here lacks the professionalism of the typical Jap culture.

Also the reception lady could have had a little passion i guess.

Yes, all true! Although rumour had it that there was a pile of bodies out back... not the dodgy power point though!

Services Provided :	Massage and HJ
Value for money/recommend? : ??
My experience/comments :

I visited 1-5 Albany St last week for the first time in around 18 months. 

Since the current shop opened I've generally found the J girls a little disappointing and expensive, compared to say Ginza etc. Occasionally I've found a few gems, with most services available for $50. I guess that's what keeps me coming back.

I hadn't booked ahead but managed to walk straight into a booking with Moe (no lineup or choice was offered). Moe was wearing an XL hoodie, so it was difficult to see what she looked like physically. The massage was pretty average, with light stroking motions. I tried to start a conversation during the first 5mins, but soon gave up after receiving 2-3 word answers. 

With 10mins to go Moe offered a HJ for $20 or Nude HJ for $50. I took the $50 option as clothed HJ's dont do it for me.

The HJ was actually pretty good. Moe had an interesting technique, which was quite gentle but still helped me blow a big load. She didnt mind me playing with her B cups or shaved pussy either.

Overall: Not sure I'd return to see Moe, average at best... but I've had worse.

Girl's Name : Emmy

Establishment : Japanese Massage, 2/1-5 Albany St, Crows Nest/St Leonards

Date of Visit : Thursday 24/11/2016

Hours of Business : 10 am until 10pm 7-days (so I'm told)

Rates : $65 - 1 hour / $55 - 45 minutes / $40 - 30 minutes

Age : mid 20s?

Size/shape : Size 8 nice girl medium size good body

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

Services Provided : Fully nude massage with HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes / Yes with a few caveats

My experience/comments :

I've been quiet on the erotic massage side of life for a wee while but with circumstances changing, feeling toey started coming to the fore.  So this report is the first of a series of recent visits to erotic houses of good repute. 
I have a bit of a fetish for Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese so decided to kick start life with a Japanese menu.  Hadn't been here for some time so wandered in about 6.30pm without a booking and was introduced to Emmy.  She seemed nice but a little reserved and shy (like many Japanese women in my experience) and showed me to the room inviting me then to get undressed. When she returned I had deliberately left my boxers on and asked her "on or off' - she replied off please which I took as an encouraging sign.
Lay down on my front and her massage was quite good though not erotic and w/o TT.  She still came across as an interesting and very pleasant young woman though.
At turnover time, she leant down near my  ear to motion whether I'd like a handjob and with/without her clothes on.  Not surprisingly (for me) I said yes please and of course in Japanese for both.  Emmy then stripped off to reveal a magnificent set of shapely breasts 34C?? and no pubic hair (most Japanese women keep their pubes or maybe trim slightly if they're westernised).  Told me she had hers lasered.

She let me touch her breasts but was hesitant about my suckling them 'next time maybe'.  The HJ however was totally great - I'm an older guy so sometimes need a little encouragement which she did without hesitation and wanting to rush.  The usual Japanese 'customer service' ethic was totally there.  Emmy did indicate that she liked having her pussy eaten and that it could be available to occasional customers (regular??) if she liked them.  Once naked with ice broken, this woman oozed sensuality and took her time with everything - I spurted the little boys onto my upperchest which Emmy let out a wee squeal of delighted surprise to.

WIR : So this was a 45 minute visit with a sexy girl who is very easy to get along with and who will look after you.  Despite the lack of initial eroticism, I am indeed tempted and will do so. I'll be very interested to see how we go.

My experience/comments :

This visit is essentially identical to what happened, and when, in my earlier review of Emmy.  I asked for her again to see if more might happen especially by me to her magnificent breasts and lasered tush.
While the usual Japanese 'customer service' ethic was totally there, nothing more happened on Emmy’s part.  No more touching etc even though I was easily able to release the little boys onto my upperchest which Emmy again let out a wee squeal of delighted surprise to.

WIR : Nope.  Much better value out there.  But I am tempted to see what other Japanese women here are like.  Will ToFTT and report.

Age:	30 (she said which I believe)

Size:	Size 8-9 nice girl medium size good body

Nationality	Japanese

Services:	Fully nude massage with HJ

Value for money/recommend?

Yes 8.5/10

My experience/comments :

Called in here on the spur of the moment as was in the area and given my penchant for Asian women (especially Japanese given their customer service attitude but at the risk of being distant).  Also curious to give this place another chance since my episodes with Emmy.

Walked in to be allocated ‘Arisha’ who accompanied me to the room at the top of the stairs – small and clean but quite basic décor.  On a hunch, I asked Arisha if she was available for an hour booking which she was delighted to accept saying it had been a slow day andI was her first customer in the 2 hours since she started.  Handed over the $ showing her ‘tactfully’ that a pineapple was left over and was invited to ‘all off’ and lie on the table.

Lay on my front with the massage off to a good start by Arisha opening my legs wide (ankles on the edge of the table) and sitting on her knees between my knees (I find it quite a turn-on being opened up like that). She then massaged my legs and back initially lacking in eroticism until she started on my buttocks and dripped oil down my crack.  Wow!

After the buttocks with accompanying brushes of the tackle, I was invited to turnover and choose from a $20 HJ or $50 clothes off.  Naturally for me, the $50 option was chosen with Arisha stripping to reveal a lovely proportionate set of boobs with fully shaven downstairs.  This lead into a delightful session of stroking and kissing my nipples with one hand while she played with the little, but growing, man with the other.  Included was stroking of the ‘taint’ and asshole with a finger but no penetration.  She was happy to be touched volunteering she prefers her nipples gently sucked rather than kissed or fondled.  After a short time, she threw her head back saying not to stop doing that and my playing with her clit. Arisha was happy for guidance quickly and willingly slowing down and changing her technique to suit this old bloke's needs (was afraid of popping too soon) and blew a big load of swimmers over her hands and boobs,  

While one’s time/$ may YMMV, I had a great time with a lovely, well spoken Japanese woman with a good command of English.  She said she's worked her for about a year.

Would happily ask for her again and intend to do so.

Arisha only works a couple of days starting late afternoons after classes.

Value for money/recommend? : yep

My experience/comments :

SO i had some time to kill after dropping off my nephews at a local pool in crows nest....and with 45 mins before i had to pick them up what could i possibly do ?

i almost had a hafl day at work so i felt i had earned a massage ! and i havent been to this japanses place in a while and last experiences at serenity (thai place) were disappointing

when i popped in remembered why i hate this place - as soon as you open the door... the manager and girls are just staring right at you and most rooms are up these high stairs...feels so wierd...whereas the massage place at 83 walker st is so discreet and well set out...it sort of helps

anyway momo had on a bralet with a jacket over it and short jessica simpson jeans shorts ....sold !

she is kinda medium...size 8 but she had on high heels and good size thighs and booty for a jap girl which was a great turn on as i glimpsed the legs going past my face on the face down

of course she asked what service i wanted and there was no wayi was leaving there without seeing that ass for i agreed to a pineapple and she slowly stripped in front of me whicvh was a nice touch

little in the way of teasing or foreplay was given and perhaps becuase she didnt need to....she went straight to work but little bro was helping this time...he was hard for ages without close to exploding (i did mention i worked for a whole half day)

so i had alot of time to munch on her b cups fondle her all over (didnt reach for down south)

but i thought if she was a working girl in japan there is no way this hj passes muster...so asked her if i could finish another way and motioned for her to bend over the table ...exposing that lovely asss to me and i added a bit of oil and placed little bro in her ass crack vertically and slowly moved up and down with the right pressure until i came over her ass (and a bit on the floor)

motioning to her ass...she said its soft right.. 

so best $50 spent......

Sort of - 7/10

My experience/comments :

Spur of the moment quick visit as heading out to dinner in Willoughby Rd.  Have been here several times before.  Only girl immediately available was Amy who came with me to the room when turning right at the top of the stairs.  Small, clean but basic décor with the ubiquitous paper liner on the massage table.  Just asked for a 30 minute session.
Paid the $40 to be invited to 'all off' and lie on the table.

Lay on my front with the massage off to a good start by Amy giving my back, shoulders and neck a thorough going over.  After 20 minutes was invited to turn over and given the HJ motion with $20 or $50 options.  The $50 option was selected Amy stripping to reveal lovely perky medium sized boobs with gorgeous upturned protruding nipples.

Amy was happy to be touched all over on her back, bum and breasts by hand but anyone else was politely averted.  The HJ itself was well done with Amy reading my reactions well and adjusting her movements in harmony. 

While one's time/$ may YMMV and Amy is a lovely, well-spoken Japanese woman with a good command of English, given the lack of the eros factor and her reluctance to be touched, I would probably not seek out Amy again.  For the same $, given the service offered in this shop by others plus competition from similar shops, much better value is readily available elsewhere.

Amy said she's been in Australia for 3 years, been working here for about a year and that I was her 6th customer for the day.  She works here Thursdays and Fridays.

Over and out

Cheers

Hours of Business: 10 AM  9 PM

Rates: $40 / $55 / $65 for ½hr / ¾hr / 1hr

Age: mid 20s?

Size/shape: Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity: Japanese

Services Provided : NHJ

Value for money/recommend? YMMV

My experience/comments:

Decided to try an old haunt and popped in to Albany St. Am allocated Arisa by mamasan and hand over coin for an hour. Arisa is fairly easy on the eye but by no means a stunner. I note the tiny denim shorts as I follow her up the stairs - lil' melboy starts to stir. This place had had walls put in compared to the curtains only arrangement I remember from before (definitely an improvement), but still has curtains instead of doors meaning privacy still is not great. A fairly distant Arisa instructs me to strip and lie down, which I do while she disappears. I quickly discover the massage table is both hard and small (maybe this is japanese style?).

Arisa returns and begins a passable shiatsu style massage. During this time she does become a bit less distant though at no point does the massage become remotely sensual or erotic. After half an hour or so I can't take lying face down on the hard table any longer and I initiate the flip. Arisa is still somewhat distant so I roll out some charm which finally successfully breaks the ice enough for her enquire about extras. I take the $50 option and Arisa nudes up to reveal a lovely slim body, pert boobies and creamy soft skin. She commences some decent erotic massage, teasing now no-so-lil' melboy with some skill. 

Having not enjoyed the company of a japanese girl for some time I decide I'm more interested in exploring her body than a HJ, so suggest a massage exchange. She initially seems a bit puzzled by this (maybe something got lost in translation?) but she tentatively agrees and we swap positions. Arisa is initially a bit reserved but responds well to my sensual massage. Meanwhile I'm enjoying caressing almost every inch of a young japanese woman's soft skin (respectfully staying away from her lady parts). Given how well she's responded so far I up the ante some more when I get her to turn over. Taking the lead from the way she teased me earlier, I tease back resulting in her head turning away and breath quickening. Eventually I can't resist any more and dive in to have a good suckle at her boobs which generates a few cute little appreciative moans. I start to head south toward her completely hairless smoo with some soft kisses, but only get to plant a kiss just above before her phone alarm goes off and completely shatters the mood - we're out of time. If only the shop closed at 10 (like it used to?) instead of 9 I would have extended but mamasan barks impatiently at Arisa that time is up and shop is closing.

Overall Arisa started out distant but eventually warmed to me but of course YMMV. I suspect treating her well over repeat visits would be rewarding for those prepared to put in the groundwork.

My experience/comments:

Arrived after 9 one evening to try out this Under New Management shop. At this late hour (or this early stage of operations) it seems there's only one girl working and she's busy with another customer so cheeky MILF mamasan Sakura steps up to look after me.

Turns out Sakura should stick to being mamasan because her massage is best described as "poor". Trying to save this punt, I abort the massage component and move straight to the NHJ in exchange for a pineapple. Out of her gear she looks a bit less well kept than I'd imagined when I first saw her sitting behind the desk, but still okay for her age I guess. 

Like her massage, Sakura's not great at working a cock either. I play with her naked body a bit trying to help myself get across the line but lil melboy is just not feeling it, so in the end I abort and just get her to give me a head massage until time is up.

On the way Sakura promises me lots of beautiful young girls on my return. Hopefully she's not in charge of training 'em!

WIR? Sure, but to try other girls!

My experience/comments:

Returned again late-ish one evening to see if mamasan's promises of beautiful young girls is even remotely true. Sakura remembers me and sends me upstairs to meet Angel (the only girl working at this late hour I suspect).

Angel appears in the room not long after I get there and I'm pleased to see she's quite easy on the eye if not particularly young. I nude up and lie on the table and Angel makes it clear almost right from the start that this is gonna be fun! I lay on the charm (and part with some folding) and within five minutes I have her lying on her back on the tablegiving me a footjob in her birthday suit. She is one horny woman! Basically from this point forward it is all a bit of a blur - we spend the rest of our allocated time generally enjoying each others bodies, doing pretty much everything [vanilla] but massage and FS.

WIR? Yep. Only regret is that I haven't found the time yet!

Treat her well gents!

Telephone: 0413 199 335

Rates : 40 – 30 mins / $55 - 45 mins / $70 Hour plus $20 Tug / $50 Nude Tug

Age: 25 or so

Size: Size 8-9 nice girl medium size good body

Nationality Japanese with a good command of conversational English  Been in Oz for just on a year.

Services Received: Topless massage with HJ

Value for money/recommend?  Sort of - 7/10

My experience/comments :

Financial fortunes have improved a little in recent times so thought it was time to both enjoy things and spread the good cheer around with a working woman or 2 or 3.  This parlour while having a basic standard of room presentation has generally had staff with good customer service attitude (very Japanese eh).

Anyways popped in w/o an appointment to see 2 girls sitting in reception, Ann taking my immediate fancy so asked if she might be available for 45 minutes please.  I find 30 minutes too short and rushed; an hour booking set aside for those women of known history and value with 45 minutes being a good compromise.

She then took me upstairs to the straight ahead room, invited me to get undressed (nothing said about underwear off or on).  Stripped off anyway and lay face down to await Ann’s return.  Massage was so so w/o any real tease or TT with the usual Q of ‘would you like anything else’ said in a cute Japaanese and shy way after 30 minutes oir so.  She did laugh when I said in Japanese “I hoped you would ask”.

Ann then stripped off to be just topless (no reason offered or sought) to display cutish, medium size breasts with a sexy amount of pendulous sag.  Two tone too – said she likes t0 go to the beach mentionng North Manly and Freshwater.  Said she’s too shy to ever think about going topless at the beach.

The HJ was good and I kept close to coming w/o actually getting there.  Ann though with typical customer service focus stayed track without the slightest hesitation culminating in a very pleasing squirt.  Afterward she got a hot towel and gave a good wipedown.

Other factors: Pubic shaved /trimmed: Dunno as only topless massage provided / Body Art: Nothing visible / Piercings?: Nothing visible / Full Sex Available: Don’t know; neither requested nor offered  / BJ : Don’t know; neither requested nor offered / DATY / Oral On Her: Don’t know; neither requested nor offered

WIR: to see Ann– for the body and HJ though her lacking TT/tease coupled with her limit of only allowing minor touching of her breasts (ie no nuzzling or suckling) meant she’s not really erotic enough.  Some thing about her tempts me to return to see what might develop :-) :-) 

Ann works 2 days there a week (Sunday and Friday).

Enjoy guys

My experience/comments :

Was passing thru and had some time on hands, planning to visit some of my old haunts over the coming month's, places I haven't visited for a couple of years for whatever reason, a bit of punting nostalgia.

Entered and there was greeted by someone, not to good English, Coco came in and took over. Ushered upstairs to the first room, remember when there were just curtains if anything at all! Still hot and lack of air but turned the cooler on and was nearly working 45 minutes later...

For some reason I thought I was going to get the girl that couldn't speak English but was pleasantly surprised when in walked Coco. Very pleasant to look at, small, soft smooth skin, cute smile, B cups and shaved pussy...

She commenced the massage before I asked what extras were on offer, the usual, a tug for $20 or nude with HJ $50.

Watched her undress then she pushed me back down onto the table for the massage, the occasional rub of her tummy, boobs and legs against my body but always just out of reach...

Eventually ready for the flip and clearly touching boobs and pussy not appreciated so I was a good boy and enjoyed her oiling me up, bringing me to life whilst a gently stroked her cute arse...

Pleasant enough tug Imagining what I'd really like to be doing to her cute, trim body, but alas I was only allowed to dream....

She is heading home on the 17th for Hostie school with JAL, she is too short for international so has to settle for domestic...

Nice girl, too nice a girl, needs to be a bit more cheeky and open....but who can complain.

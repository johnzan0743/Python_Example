I used to frequent an RnT on the Pacific Highway EMP, and not aware of this new place. Will keep an eye out or it..

I'll have a look,  it maybe be signage to the one up the back stairs, or front entry from 290A entrance on Pac Hwy. 
No ref on that door to any establishment, but I think it leads up there. Will confirm, unless its a new place.

It's down the side street (moree st?) off PAC hwy opposite bunnings. There a dodgy sign in a window about 2 floors up and a proper sign at the top of some stairs just above the cafe.

Whatakonk... In my post I was referring to 290A. The massage parlour has long moved from there. Would be great if you could check it out from EMP's post

I checked this place out about a month ago, and got the impression out is legit.

There was only a male massuer there when I called in. Maybe there are girls on at other times.

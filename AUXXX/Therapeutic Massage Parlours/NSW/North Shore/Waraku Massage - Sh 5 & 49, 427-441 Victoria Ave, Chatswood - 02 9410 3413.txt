This place is totally legit, however, if you have some aches and pains you need fixed then look no further.

It is a Japanese style massage, which I definitely prefer compared with either Chinese or Thai.

The bonus is about 80% of the ladies that work there are young and attractive. Some fo these girls would make a killing if they decided to join "the dark side".

Health fund rebates are also available.

$45 for 30 mins.

enjoy!

I can only agree. The Japanese girls here are generally fantastic rubbing - not your harder Chinese style massage - sensual - but nothing doing on the RNT front. They have a strict underpants on policy here. The girls are fantastic. For a big cock tease try your luck here.

but that is all you get..  in fact it I would hardly call it that.. The girls are lovely and the saving grace is you can claim private health fund rebates however after a few visits I decided even those rebates could be put to much better use.

Well fellow punters I was doing some shopping and happend across this place - in the Lemon Grove Shopping Centre - opposite Westfield. And since nobody had written about I thought I'd TOFTT.

First of all this place is legit  - or no additional services were offered when I went. OK now on with the review

ML was Mariko - works Tuesday and Sunday - 30 something Japanese lady with good english. The body was OK but hard to see under the coat.

If you want a cranking good massage with no extras she is your girl, gives a great remedial massage

Prices are

30mins $45
45mins $68
60mins $85
75mins $100
90mins $115
120mins $145

This place is TOTALLY CLEAN and legit.
If you have bad back or pain then I recommend this place.
Been there many times for pain and they fixed it better than all the other massage places in the shopping centres.
If you looking for the other extras this is not the place.

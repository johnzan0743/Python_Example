 New Shop

For all you massage aficionados, just a heads up for a new ad recently appearing in the NST Massage Therapy columns.





A Chatswood New Remedial
Relaxing Massage. $55/hr. L1
6/67A Archer St 8095 0266
			
		

The ground floor at this address has been an Oriental Spa for quite some time... quite legit... I even presented SWMBO with a gift voucher. She never mentioned a happy ending 

This ad appears to refer to upstairs and of course is just what Chatswood desperately needs. No doubt I will attend at some stage soon unless one of you deviates gets there first and trashes the place (in finest literary style here of course!).

And there's a bit for the desperate voyeurs among you... the current Google street view has a couple of young lovelies wandering by...  

Like Kevin... I'm here to help...

Yeah, he's there up the road (outside the cop-shop)... prob photographing punters. With the number of busy RnT shops here, every second dude on the street must be guilty as charged your honour...!!

All ready tried and this shop doesn't exist, unless of course you ring the number and its Elaine's shop across the road, they must have fucked up the address in the new ad?

Well there you go... either the new shop is staffed by marketing incompetents or I've been fucked over by the Murdoch powerhouse of proof-reading incompetence.

Mods feel free to delete this thread and save me from CIA-style intelligence damnation

Give it 24 hours and then if it is in error we will do something about it.

Yeah, this one's a typo by News Ltd - no shop at that location, phone number is that of 76A (aka Elaine's)

Yes, my bad Sparksy... I should have shut up at least until I dialled the number or tried to climb the stairs!!! Besides... I should've realised the Elaine connection!

But I still say: "I've been fucked over by the Murdoch powerhouse of proof-reading incompetence."

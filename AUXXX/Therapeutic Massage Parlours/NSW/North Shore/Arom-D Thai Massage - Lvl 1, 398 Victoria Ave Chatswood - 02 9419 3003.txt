Had a couple of great Thai oil massages at this place. Unlike others, they ask that you be fully naked, which sort of had me wondering. Some high groin massaging and a few accidental brushes against my obviously hard cock had me wondering about extras, but absolutely no more signs, not the slightest recognition of the effect on me. Tried to drop a couple of hints about other services but language can be a bit of an issue. Has anyone worked out if this is more than just great legit massage?

Curious... the web site looks definitely legit but I wonder... upstairs and all... any Thai massage place that talks about foot massage is normally legit although I bet some of the girls work at other places and know the score...

Oh, that's just what Chatswood needs - an Asian massage place. Because, you know, they don't have anywhere nearly enough of these..! :P  Seriously this is like opening a new Thai restaurant in Newton!

That they want you to be naked is perhaps a positive sign, and it certainly does set the scene for extras more than if you were wearing your briefs or even had changed into their own lightweight pants (although they used to do that at Chequers and I think Xanadu as well, a thin pair of pants for decorum but easy for the lady to open or whip off completely). Brushing of your boy bits would also indicate options beyond the massage itself, unless they truly were accidental - but maybe they need clearer signs, for you to really initiate - maybe you need to gently move their hand towards your hardness Â– or perhaps this just isn't standard procedure for this place...

Anyway, Ledge, can you supply address and web site for this one?

Flyboy, couldn't agree more re the supply side in Chatswood, which makes me wonder a bit why a legit business would open it's doors in the midst of suburbia's Sin City. They are at First Floor, 398 Victoria Road Chatswood. Website is http://www.arom-d.com.au/. Will have to be more up front next time. Having said that, I just hope it doesn't distract them from the massage - IMHO there's something to be said for getting a good massage and not knowing how it will turn out!

Anyone tried this place out more recently or tried the Honey mentioned by our "Tiandi mate" Singer in a recent post, I looked pretty closely at this place and it looks legit. If extras are available its anice comfortable place to be getting them, looks like a place you could even shout the missus a massage at, her in one room and you in the other with Honey getting closer to the delights of Thailand.

Went there ages ago when it was new. Strange atmosphere, they didn't seem very interested at the front desk. Had a massage but it was in a big room with the tables seperated by a curtain and hardly any privacy. No communication and no hints. Haven't been back.

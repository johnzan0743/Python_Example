1/19 Broughton St, Kirribilli.  (Upstairs)
Phone: 9922 6381` - Mob: 0432 225 853

Remedial Massage - Chinese Herbal Medicine

Another New Shop appears and surprise, surprise as an ex Mamasan emerges as Mamasan again.!!!

Opened last week or so.

Open 7 days – 9am – 9pm.

$40 / $70 – 30 / 60 + Tips.

Opposite Milson Point Station in Broughton St.

Exit the station on the eastern side turn right walk to the lights to cross to opposite side.
Across the road, on the corner, you can see a Flight Centre, Kirribilli 19 is two doors up.
Discreet entry from the street because the entrance is via “small arcade”, which is under a large sign which says KB Village Dental. –  walk in take the stairs on the left at the back, climb to the top – the door is on the right at the top. (Other sign here says K&D Acupuncture – it will be called Kirribilli 19.)

In the door – to be greeted by “Joint Mamasans” ??

Very clean neat set up.

3 Massage rooms – Walls to the ceiling ! … And separated !! – Rooms at the back are best.

There were the 2 mamasans plus 3 massage girls, plus another (“doctor”) who only does massage, cupping and acupuncture. So you can get a “Phelps”  cupping from the young “doctor” here before !!

2 to 3 different girls each day, I am told.

I have stayed in touch with the “lead” Mamasan since she sold her shop in Albany St a couple of years ago, got a call from her today,” to come visit” 

On arrival got taken to the back room by both Mamasans who then brought in a very attractive Thai lass – but that is another story – Report. 

The Mamasans ? – Rose and her friend Lina.

Person's Name : JEAN

Establishment : Kirribilli 19

Date of Visit : 15/8/16

Contact Details: Suite 1, 19 Broughton St. Kirribilli (02) 9922 6381. Mob: 0420 508 878

Rates : $40 for 30mins + $20 GST -  Clothed 
Age : 30 ? 

Size/shape: size 8+, Lovely girl, beautiful face and smile, rounded figure, good shape well endowed.  

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai

Services Provided : Massage +  HJ (It's all I wanted- YMCV)

Value for money/recommend? : Yes for sure. YMMV 

Background:

I know Mamasan Rose well from Albany 6 days  in fact I remember her last day there indelibly.
She has business partner here, Lina, Milf, who was one of her ladies at Albany.

The shop is right at the top of the stairs  The door is on the right. 

Don't peel off and go to the Dental Surgery.  which you can see as you walk up stairs !!

This place gets quite a few female customers and has a qualified "doctor" for acupuncture, cupping and she does straight massage only  Respect her, it's her choice. Young, sweet, shy.

Yesterday there was Thai  Jean; Chinese- Eva, slim little thing; Chinese  Lisa, size 6, plus the "doctor" another Lina, who is Korean.

They had about 4 customers through in my time there .. so, it has been discovered.

Mamasan Lina (Milf) will get busy! 

Will have some different girls cycling through each day Rose says.

My experience/comments:

Got taken to the back room, on the left (which is at the front of the building) by Mamasns both of whom did a familiarisation check on me whilst Thai Jean came in. So I was jammed between the three of them, with Jean already exuding her beautiful smlile.

The Mamasans left and Jean I and chatted and became acquainted., 

Room is clean, bright, they use disposable bed covers  GOOD.

Treat her nicely lads she is really sweet. She can massage, she gives great eye (.able) eye contact, will take instructions, is there to please, a slow (a good Thai slow) build up and the denouement? Well it left me replete and relaxed.

YMCV and in fact YMMV. 

I have written a bit excessively here as it is a new shop and did the TOFTT  I hope you can all find and enjoy a thorough therapeutic massage !!!!!!!!!!!!!

I need to clarify the above post in respect to the cupping aspect, etc.

sometimes, in many shops, I am not sure if it is their inability to convey the message (because of language) or my inability to understand !! ..Maybe a little of both.? Whatever .!

Apparently the Acupuncture, etc is done by Male "doctor", qualified, of Acupuncture, Danny. The bookings are made via Rose and all the gear is in the back room.
The young lady I saw yesterday does do the same but is less experienced and maybe still studying ?? . whatever.

Today Rose and Tina were working. Tina a tall Chinese lass, whom I met briefly.
So sometimes 1 or 2 girls with Rose.

Dropped I in here on Sunday as a result of a call from Mamasan Rose.

There was Lina, her partner, the Doctor was in the Acupuncture room with a female client so Rose bid me to be quiet ?? .. I already was !!

Then Rose took me out the back ... again ...and brought in Yumi ...DAM !!

Young Hong Kong girl - Rose says "I can see you need it" ..????

I really did Not .. but I did ... more on that later.

Rose herself was just about to get busy, she will do a turn, if the others are busy. she will of course seek to "divert" you.

It's worthwhile getting to know this Mamasan - a top class massage (qualified), who believes in TT, and can do 'reach through" ...!! ..

A hot MiLF.. I think ..!! .. and in good shape !!

Yumi I wiil AR as soon as I catch up>>!! I think she is only Sundays.

Since returning to Sydney for a few months I have been playing "catch-up" around the traps.

I was in Kirribilli 19 today and it was pretty busy  so plenty of punters are active.

Most of the girls are ex Shopping Centre (SC) masseuse  so they can massage !!

It used to be legit and still draws quite a few legit customers, male and female, plus Acupuncture clients for the Dr. I was talking to the Mamasan today when a lady came in for massage which meant all the rooms were full as two of the other girls Tina, and Lina were busy. !!

Tina, (SC), is about 170cm, good body and nice legs  she is usually busy !! - I must try !!

Oh!, the Thai I saw who I ARd above, called Jean, I believe is "Jan" .. accent !! or my bad hearing >?

I have racked up a few visits in here in last week or so, and the Mamasan (Rose) had told me to come in today for "look" 

Interim summary  Personal experience.

Yumi  Sunday  she is young, attractive, 170cm, good body, Hong Kong girl.  Not shopping centre trained, but I find her damned enjoyable  return factor is high for me  AR  hopefully soon

Bobo  Thursday girl  saw her this week  yep shopping centre trained. She is small 4  6, can't be over 40kgs  150cm  slim !!!  chatterbox  but she CAN massage, it is strong !!  and she can follow up. She is worth an AR and it will be done. I will most certainly see her again.

Today  well today, I was taken to the Acupuncture room and detained, for good reason, by both Mamasans, and another. Well think of a "Whoopi Goldberg" movie and sequel ..!@@!

There just might be some very interesting news to follow soon, I hope, and an AR on today

Person's Name: YUMI

Establishment: Kirribilli 19

Date of Visit: 21/8/16 - Sunday

Contact Details: Suite 1, 19 Broughton St. Kirribilli (02) 9922 6381. Mob: 0420 508 878

Rates: $70 for 60mins + $50 GST .

Hours: 10 - 8

Age: mid 20s ? 

Size/shape: size 8, attractive girl, slight Olive complexion, lovely smile, around 170cm she is in good shape, B+s. 

Nationality or Ethnicity: Hong Kong

Services Provided: NMHJ 

Value for money/recommend? : Yes for me. YMMV

Background:

I had walked in expecting to see Rose on reception, instead a Young girl engaged me with a half smile and good eye contact. "Is Rose in? "  "No, she come later. You want massage?"  "No, just come to chat to Rose. What is your name?"  "I am Yumi, you want massage?"  

She kept looking me in the eye  reeling me in  I found myself saying  "I have to do something, But I'll be back".  I did .!!

My experience/comments: 

When I returned Rose was in the shop and escorted me to the back room, on the left, with Yumi in close attendance. I told them 30 mins  "we'll see how it goes", unusual for me. (First time is mostly 30 mins and clothed)

Yumi has been here about 18 months, studying now,  not sure what, I was not concentrating, I was evaluationg.

She has a subtle sexuality about her, which got me in, and I moved to get her gear off ASAP, especially those pink nickers. She asked me if I would reward her, "sure"  "Now"  "ok".

Not athletically toned  but femininely toned, flat tummy, bullet nipples, she is a bit shy and sensitive when I engaged with those. Oh!!  she IS nicely smooth !! .. !!!

We just fooled around !! .. she was accommodating, not in a rush and I decided to extend to the hour!!!!??

She is NOT Shopping Centre masseuse, frankly I was not interested in that deficiency, if it was one. She was keen to massage my shoulders and back, and she did ok, but I directed her in other desires and her handiwork was very good, slow, and I enjoyed the conclusion, aided by her enticing prompts.

I really enjoyed her attention and would certainly return, and maybe will, but Rose's roster confronts me, so it may be awhile before it happens. !!

This is a real YMMV, as always of course  it was a prevalence of just good chemistry for me. !!

Note: I have a couple of more ARs to do for this shop  I have seen four girls here in the last 11 days, the budget is empty and that is not the only thing !!  - Some respite is in order. ??

Date of Visit : August 2016

Contact Details: Suite 1, 19 Broughton St. Kirribilli (02) 9922 6381. Mob: 0420 508 878

Rates : $60 for 45 minutes + $50 tips
Age : 35

Size/shape: size 8+, shapely - but not big

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai

Services Provided : Massage + NHJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes 

Background:

Came here to check the place out. Called ahead of time and the mamasan said was told Tina and Jean was on. I said lets go with Jean. Came in, no problems finding the place, next to the Gelatissimo shop up the stairs. Ushered into the back room in the left and was asked to pay up front. No problems there. 

Stripped and Jean came in. She has a pretty smile and is very friendly and nice to talk to. I can vouch that she gives a darned good massage. One of the best I've had in a while now. My back felt so much better after she had worked her magic. She was hitting all the spots without me saying a word. We didn't really chat much at the start because the room had 2 curtains and I heard rustling sound behind the other curtain and thought someone else was there. So that felt a bit awkward, after a while I hear the curtains open and the door close and no more sound. Pretty sure it wasn't another punter, maybe someone sleeping there?

Anyway, great massage. Turned over, great technique and finish. She gave me an awesome neck and shoulder massage to finish while I was sitting up. I will come back for her every single time because her massage is that good.

Hours: 10 - 8

Age: late 20s ? 

Size/shape: size 4-6, She is small, can't be over 40kgs  Very friendly  a chatterbox  

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided: CMHJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes. YMMV her size will be an influencer..

My experience/comments: 

Shopping Centre (SC) trained, she delivers a quite strong massage for her size and is proud of her routine and gets into it with some alacrity. Tends to climb up on the table and clambers around you while working the muscle spots and is very confident in her ability. As I said, a bit of a chatterbox, so just tell her you like a quiet massage, if that is your preference, she is ok with that .. !!

I must say I quite liked her second phase massage as well, can be guided, said she was learning because of her previous SC work. Her technique was good and she was keen to send me to the precipice, and did, with a bit of encouragement. !!

She will not appeal to those who like womanly figures . May not drop her Mocca!!, hasn't yet.

An enthusiastic little lady, anyway up to you all She is there Thursday.


Mamasan Rose is starting to build a skilful coterie of girls.!!

Conundrum:

Kirribilli 19 was a Standard Chinese / Acupuncture shop with a mix of Female / Male clients  that is still the case.

The price for a Therapeutic massage was $80 for 60 mins.

When the current operators took over they charged $70 for 60 mins.

The conundrum  The Mamasans then discovered old customers expected to pay the 80 / 60; so now they are / wish to charge all at the $80 / 60 rate on the basis of having superior trained masseuses (for the massage) than most other shops. This is quite possibly true  however, when asked, I did protest and said no thanks too much. I said $70 is my figure, and that is what I paid, but I believe a few have coughed up !!.

I hope we can hold the line at this rate !!!

Establishment: Kirribilli 19

Date of Visit: September 1 - Thursday

Contact Details: Suite 1, 19 Broughton St. Kirribilli (02) 9922 6381. Mob: 0420 508 878

Rates: $40 for 30mins + $20 CHJ.

Hours: 10 - 8

Age: late 26 - 28 ? 

Size/shape: size 8+, She is tallish about 170cml, good legs and body, maybe Bs. She had on some black stretch pants and she has good shape.   

Nationality or Ethnicity:Thai / Japanese (predominately Thai)

Services Provided: CMHJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes. Will get better with familiarity - YMMV

My experience/comments: 

I had been in the city and swung by Kirribilli on the way home as I heard a new girl (Sakura -Thai / Japanese) was in situ. I am partial to Thai and Japanese. 

Three girls, plus Rose today. Bobo was there and I really wanted to have another go with her, then there was Thoa?? A MILFY lady, and Sakura.

Mamasan Rose was keen to intro me to new girl Sakura, I don't mind a taller girl, and Sakura is in good shape, so before I know it Rose has me out the back to the curtained room on the left, with Sakura in tow.

Sakura is a bit reserved, so I worked assiduously for the 30 mins (probably closer to 40) to establish a good rapport, get her smiling, get her relaxed and trusting.
She has been massaging about 1.5 years, but had only done 1 HJ previously, in Bondi Jcn, I think, so she has just joined the "Faith"

That lit me up  I was her second  so I was quickly into those "virginlike" hands. Not a bad technique, spent a bit of time educating her on reverse corkscrew, slow, take your time, vary it, etc, etc.  She was happy to follow instructions, not a lot of eye contact or interaction, but her ACTIONS were good enough to give me a sudden, warm flushing spasm. All good.

Then to the massage  I was surprised - very good technique, long slow strokes, can apply good tissue pressure, was the right weight for me  and on the whole the massage was very good. Back, legs and great head massage to finish.

I did not ask her to doff her Mocca, she said she will for people she feels comfortable with and who respect her boundaries. I will be back for her and have negotiated  in advance!!. I sense a lot of reward could come from future rapport / skill development here. !!

She is on Thursday and again Saturday.

Rose said she is keen to retain her young girls and have people "train" them up .!!

Further to this short missive: "Today  well today, I was taken to the Acupuncture room and detained, for good reason, by both Mamasans, and another. Well think of a "Whoopi Goldberg" movie and sequel ..!@@! "

When I was in this shop last week I had scheduled a session with a new girl Lisa, who it turned out was the girl under instruction from Rose when I arrived.

Rose was keen to demonstrate some HJ techniques including "reach through"

I won't detail that here, it may well be described at another time, and the fact that the other Mamasan Lina (vixen that she is) was also in attendance.

Now it turns out LISA is Rose's younger sister !!!!  Lisa is Shopping Centre trained  but had never done a HJ before (SHE HAS NOW)  She is a pretty girl, size 6, 5 foot, 30s, but looks younger.

I suggested to Rose that she and Lisa should get creative and provide a Double  "A SISTER ACT"

She thought about it, grinned, and we did a short rehearsal... !

Today I asked Rose if the Sister Act Double is on the cards..

She gave that penetrating grin and said, "ok if you book ahead so that both are available."

She said LISA  is working Saturday, .....  and so is Rose - 

So is Sakura

Age : 40's

Size/shape : average

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : It was OK.  Will try again with another massesuse

My experience/comments :

I'd seen this place a number of times when I used to live in Milsons Point, however from my research it just appeared to be a regular remedial massage place.  I stumbled across an ad in the back of the Mosman Daily and guessed it must have changed hands..  So I was in North Sydney and finished my meeting at 9:30 and figured I could have a quick punt before anyone missed me back at the office..  Called up the massage place in Kirribilli, they wouldn't confirm any extras on the phone, but the usual "you come try" always gives it away.

So I rode down to Kirribilli and walked up to the shop.  It's off the main street in an alley which also has a dentist and something else.  From the street people will just assume you are going to the dentist, but anyone sitting in the dentist waiting room will know you're a dirty bastard..  LOL..

So enter the shop and greeted by the Mamasan, it's really early and she is the only one working..  She is about 5 foot 1, stocky but not fat and a fair rack  She's wearing a pretty short dress as well  I ask if they have a shower but she advises they only have hot towels, not an issue for me being early in the day, but I wouldn't fancy going in there after getting off the train after a long days work with a sweaty ass..  The massage room was 1 big room with approximately 5 or 6 beds with curtains separating them, so not much privacy and I guess extras are limited.  I did notice another room next to the bathroom that had a bed and a door, but no idea what that was for.  I was shown to the end bed by the window, I guess they try and space customers out as it fills up.

I strip down and lie on the bed and mamasan gets to work on me..  She gives an absolute fantastic massage, pointed out points of tension on my back and worked on them, she pulled, pushed, stretched, cracked it couldn't have been better..  She climbed on the bed and sat on my ass as she was massaging my back, as she was wearing a short dress I could feel her bare thighs wrapping around me, it felt great and awoke the beast  The tackle tickle started while I was still lying face down and she had a good technique, time to turn over and she was straight onto my cock and really working on it the way older Chinese ladies all seem to know how to (no mention of tips at this point)..  She's positioned herself at the side of the bed for me to get perfect access to her ass and pussy, I'm glad she was wearing a short dress  I was first massaging her pussy through her panties, it was nice an puffy, She was moaning but not fake, then I could feel her pussy open and knew she just got wet..  I pulled her knickers aside to reveal a lovely shaved pussy and slipped a finger up her, she pushed down on it and moaned more whilst still working on my cock..  I couldn't hold on long in this position and blew my load.  She cleaned me up and also wiped my fingers which was nice  After cleanup she continued with head and neck massage.. then cleaned down with hot towels..

While I was getting changed she said they have loads of Chinese uni girls working there later in the day and I should come back and try them..  She asked for a tip and I gave her $20 which she was happy with..

The only bad part was as it was so early, she was the only person on and had to step away a couple of times for the phone and someone else arrived at work and she spoke to them..  But finding an RnT place open before 10am was a bonus..

Contact Details: Suite 1, 19 Broughton St. Kirribilli (02) 9922 6381. Mob: 0420 508 878

Rates: $40 for 30mins + $20 CHJ. (Clothed HJ)

Hours: 9am-9pm

Age: late 20s ? 

Size/shape: size 4-6, She is very slim, A's, I suspect?, about 160cm, Very friendly  wears glasses.  

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided: Massage

Value for money/recommend? : Yes. Well I enjoyed the interaction / chatting   very YMMV

My experience/comments: 

I had seen Eva previously when I had been assigned to "another lady" by Rose. (that is another story). Eva is very slim, good English, and can carry on a good conversation. I was a little intrigued by the "Librarian style glasses" she was wearing and her engaging personality. Also!! .. there was also the obvious mayhem she caused another client on that previous occasion when I was under remedial therapy just though the curtains. She had chuckled conspiratorially at his ecstatic distress in such a manner as to cause me to want to find out "what was that all about"  as did my "interlocuteur" at the time.

So here we were. She has been in Aust a few years and worked around the industry in Sydney  I am sure I have read of her description in some forum report?? -  Currently works here Wednesday and a couple of other shops !!

Can she massage?  dunno (Mamasan says she can) and we did not have time. We had a ripping carnal convo, she was very adept in manual dexterity, variable manipulation, stroking  I had to back her off a couple of times before the inevitable conclusion. She is not a glamour, but hell, she is keen to please, does her best, get's excited by the outcome, and for me it was fun.!! 

I will see her again, maybe not next visit  she probably will not suit those who want big boobs, etc. but she was ok for me .!! .. and obviously that other punter I (we) heard ..!@@!

Value for money/recommend? : Yes. Good fun  but others to see.

My experience/comments: 

Returned to K19 after a foray, or two, in some other establishments. Mamasan Rose was in attendance, along with Michelle and an interesting new girl from a country which piqued my interest, for next time. She has been there a couple of weeks apparently, so others do know about her.????

I went with Michelle, as I had got a few good vibes from her as I chatted with her and Rose. So I was able to get to know her a bit beforehand. She was keen to get me into the massage room, for money of course.!!

Has good English, been here about 5 years.  Mocca on, so body detail is concealed, but the CCs are obvious.Can have a good chat, is nicely cheeky, capable and finally compelling. Technique was good and varied and she seemed to delight in its affect on me. She perched up on the end of the table facing me and the more I got to know her, the better it got .!!! ??..as they say.!!

I will see her again, but a couple of others to go first for me to progress in their roster.  YMWV, depending on your expectations.

Services Provided: Massage HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes. One of the better MILFs providing combo massage IMO. and compliments 3 other MILFs at this establishment.

It was something of a "catch-up" with Mandy, she works another shop on North shore, but my first encounter with her was way back in Albany St, when Rose was Mamasan, before Miki took over with her Japanese girls. 

My experience/comments: 

Mandy is an all-round great girl. She is a pleasure to be with and delivers an excellent remedial massage and a superb HJ all with an engaging smile and professional aplomb.
I like her, and I like her attitude, she is sweet, deserves respect and recognition.

She is always well dressed and well presented (young girls take note) this time in a white/gold neck to mid-thigh dress. It fits her well, and she it, and it shows off her key assets.

I had doffed the Mocca just as the beaming Mandy came back in after completing payment.

I was ready for her !!! .. "Nice cock" (wonderful words), she reached for me, successfully.

Plenty of long slow stroking ensued before I made it to the table, so I suggested she complete P2 before P1. Her conversation can fit the action at hand, she takes delight in her work and appeared as satisfied as me with the "reparations" she was undertaking.

She talked to me about her life in Japan and China and how I might (theoretically) deploy the cock at hand. I thought "hard" about that, lost control and lost the lot, all too quickly, and to her delight.  

Mandy gives an excellent remedial massage, shoulders, back, legs, she is very competent, hard, soft, relaxing and invigorating. (I've seen her before with Rose) As good as any legit, because her massage is legit. !! 

It was a wholesome experience, her natural eye contact, and beaming smile make the engagement very GFE. 

If you cannot connect with this girl  RETIRE !!

For sure I will return, Thursdays only I think.

Person's Name: Eva

Establishment: Kirribilli 19

Date of Visit: 19/10/2016

Contact Details: Suite 1, 19 Broughton St. Kirribilli (02) 9922 6381. Mob: 0420 508 878

Rates: $70 / 60mins

Hours: 9am-9pm

Age: late 20s ? 

Size/shape: size <6, very slim, small A-cups, about 160cm 

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided: nude RnT

WIR? : she's friendly and gets the job done

My first visit here and had hoped to catch up with Rose... I suspect I knew her from Albany days but that was a long time ago. It was Rose who greeted me... OMG, talk about an enthusiastic client welcome! She was all over me, despite the fact that I doubt we remember each other... assuming we did meet years ago! Hugging, kissing... my ardour rises rapidly,assuming she will be servicing me . Into the room and she takes two pineapples with the promise of change.

Alas, it's the "librarian" look who enters, saying she's here to treat me. A bit deflated, I go with the flow and in the end, have to agree with TIP's review above. Eva is extremely thin... her ribs seem to be trying to escape her frame. But she appears healthy and happy... a friendly girl, chatty and tactile, although I'm given very limited access to her nether regions once she has her kit off. The tug delivers nonetheless.

Eva is here Wednesdays only. Not sure I would rush back for her but Rose? Mmmm... must get back for that mamasan 

... or indeed Mandy, who I'm sure is the Mandy at 2/769. Gorgeous woman

Certainly open on New Year's day ... For a while, they moved their advert to the Massage section on Cracker which is supposed to be for legit massages (but isn't used that way ...)

Person's Name: Eva

(Like last year, I have been travelling since December until Easter  so I have been out of the playground unfortunately. I have a few to catch up on in the next week or so.)

Person's Name: Eva

Establishment: Kirribilli 19

Date of Visit: April, 19 2017 - Wednesday

Contact Details: Suite 1, 19 Broughton St. Kirribilli (02) 9922 6381. Mob: 0420 508 878

Rates: $40 for 30mins + $20 

Hours: 9am-9pm

Age: 25  28??

Size/shape: She is very slim, (very) A cup, 160cm,  wears glasses.  

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided: Massage +

Value for money/recommend? : I enjoy our interaction -  Too slim for many?  YMMV

My experience/comments: 

Rose was busy  Eva was available, I have seen her before and was in the mood for a bit of variety an extended round of "worship" massage. !! which she is happy to deliver .. and I like her in glasses !!

Into the large room at the back and I asked her to stay while I disrobed, except my undies ..!! it was up to Eva to remove those when she thought I had outgrown them !! 

There is not really a lot I can add to my previous post on this girl ---- She really does have good English, she is smart, not just intelliegent, can carry a conversation on just about any subject and can be delightfully inquisitive about your predilections at times !!. her revelations being quite surprising.

I had gone for the clothed option because contact on her is strictly limited  the prize is really out of bounds. !!! ..it was for me.!!

She soon found my concentration waning on extraneous topics during her massage, most of which was conducted with me in the standing position, however that enabled her to whisper sweet provocations in my ear as she used her "magic hands" (her words).

I actually had a lot of fun with Eva. I don't worry about whether it's a traditional massage / TT / HJ. I go for an experience I enjoy, in whatever form it takes, provided my cock is happy at the end ..

It was  so was I.

Apparently she has regulars!! 

Return? I will at some time.  But I have a return bout with Mandy and others in mind

Date of Visit: May 6, 2017 - Saturday

Contact Details: Suite 1, 19 Broughton St. Kirribilli (02) 9922 6381. Mob: 0420 508 878

Rates: $40 for 30mins + Tip

Hours: 9am-9pm

Age: 28 (I was told)

Size/shape: 7 -8, B+ cup?, 160cm, nicely rounded girl  wide eyed ..great smile   

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided: Massage +

Value for money/recommend It was for me - Good Fun - YMMV

My experience/comments: 
I had received a call from Rose that she had a new girl and that I should proceed with due haste to Kirribilli .!!

Well I took my time, wanting to show a little independence, but keen to get there poste haste and avail myself of her new services, provided I was suitabley enticed.

That was the plan.

I arrived, Lina and Rose appeared, I was steered to the small room at the back Lina asked how long?  .. I asked where is the new girl?? .. Rose appeared with Sunny ..  beaming smile from Sunny.

Sunny is average height, quite a lovely girl, with an enjoyable personality.

Sunny was not my exact choice of girl, as lovely as she is, but perhaps that was more to do with my disposition on the day .. but hey, I am here, she is pleasant and eager  TOFT time.

I decided on my usual entrée of HJ first, which is also my main course.

She was a delightful young lady  very keen to nude up, which I declined, as I often do first up, but we had a lot of fun, whispering, manipulating and laughing our way through a 30 minute conspiracy.

The conclusion was reached as a result of some damn good ministrations and delivered in whatever form, standing, lying down, that I desired.

Well a girl can't do more than that .. !! ???

Check her out.   YMMV against your checklist.

Drove to Kirribilli last weejk to pick up some Thai take-away (Stir Crazy, highly recommended) and noticed the flashing LED sign for this place was on. Reminded me that it's been very quiet on the review front here, I did visit in the early days and neglected to post a review (bad Flyboy! ) but found it a pretty raunchy experience. Nice to have a decent option at the very lower part of the lower north shore.

For a minute I thought you were referring to a new little-known rub'n'tug shop at Waverton Station, until the penny dropped that you meant the Thai place. Yeah, that used to be a Stir Crazy as well, a long time ago. I used to prefer this one because parking for the grab-and-go of takeaway was easier.

Hey, come to think of it, Waverton and Wollstonecraft are probably the only two railway stations on the lower north side without an Asian massage place LOL!

FRIDAY 13th a tale of (two) spring punts 

Person's Name: ALLY

Establishment: Kirribilli 19

Date of Visit: Friday 13th September  2019

Contact Details: Suite 1, 19 Broughton St. Kirribilli. (02) 9922 6381. Mob: 0420 508 878

Rates: $40 for 30mins + Tip

Hours: 9am-9pm

Age: late 20s ? 

Size/shape: size 6-8 , 168cm ,Cute tiny A's with darkened small nipples ,  friendly attitude. ,good English 

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese.shenzen

Services Provided: Massage NHJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes. especially for a competent therapeutic pt1. Pt.2 skilful. Though was clear about boundaries 

My experience/comments: 

Finished a chat at Celsius on kirribilli ferry wharf. And after a drive up the HUME with a stop in Goulburn where I did a walk in on a main street Chinese massage shop and left wanting , I'm tossing up Whether to try my luck at the Thai on Broughton or the Chinese .

Walk up the stairs met by the smiling Lisa  (mamasan) who is one of the young slim girls , though whilst slim is not young and in her day likely a pocket rocket/spinner

I'd texted ahead on making a decision and was told 3 girls Bella Thai , Ally and Lisa.

 I'm shown to the front room above the street. A little warm , but all very clean . The whole shop is.

Ally is a cute tallish and slim Chinese with a cute ass shown in the tight red Lycra she's pulled over her body.

Usual pleasantries exchanged  40/30 mins.

Away we go. Ally remains dressed for the pt1 despite my request to undress . No matter she's doing her thing and insists once the massage completed

As I was asked and requested hard . She's into it in a slightly modified Chinese style that does flow well. It's hard and I'm enjoying it enough 

We chat 

Very little sensual play From her whilst belly down and I lightly touch thighs and ass as she's reaching down my back. Doesn't move away 

On the flip . I'm asked if I want a little oil. Some more massage to the head . On completion she undressed

Nice matched blk lingerie not HB, but girl next door Friday night date , style.

Ally Starts to oil me up and I'm hard and wanting . Some nice confident cock ball play and various stroke techniques brings me close until I ask her to slow slow down and start again . We do this a few times .

i ask to sit up no issue and she continues .
I ask to kiss her breasts nipples - no 

Though light outer touching of the pussy is ok So I  touch gently noticing her on occasion s shift her weight and press ever so onto my hand or fingers , until she notices what she's doing and then gets strict on herself  and about touching 

This Goes on for 5 mins or so .

I'm super tired from . Work and travel . Ally's skill is good but I'm not going to cum despite her mounting the table and lowering her pussy to  me , and
I play gently with fingers on her clit and slowly stroking her labia with just enough finger presssure  to almost enter her but not.


Times up a warm towel a $50 tip and I'm done .

Pleasant not wildly engaging lovely young woman. but my session was lessened  by my tiredness from a few weeks of long work slog.

Would I go back? Maybe if getting some  stir crazy .and there were some other girls of interest

 Artarmon massage shops

I get totally lost trying to keep track of all these shops, they all seem to be on the same main road and a lot of them appear to be almost-identical 'up the stairs' places... anybody able to provide a bit of a real-world guide to exactly which one is where, along this street?

Hahaha.... where should I start?!!!!! 

From the city end:

1/44 Hampden. Modern building, straight off the street, no stairs. 4 rooms (I think), the first with a large spa which is available for booking. I'm familiar with the first two rooms. RnT.

78a Hampden. Approved FS brothel. Sister shop to 116. Some girls work both premises. Stairs off the street and rear entrance from the laneway.

88a Hampden. Old, run down, been there forever. These days, just a mostly legit RnT, AFAIK. Used to regularly get FS here but haven't been there for a while, based on negative intel.

104a Hampden. Well known Thai massage parlour. Entrance from the main street up the stairs and turn left or from the lane at the back... easy parking. Currently, strong recommend, RnT  

116 Hampden. Approved FS brothel. Look for the old sign "VIEANNET International Relaxation Centre" on the main street. Up the stairs. Or rear entrance from the lane at the back... easy parking.

Once you become familiar with these shops, it's impossible to get lost 

Have fun FB... you too could become addicted

1/44 is part of the tangs massage group of shops run by Lily. She used to own 88 Hampden and sold to one of her employees and then opened up down the road at 44.

That's true. However, my intel and experience tells me that Lily may have bitten off a bit more than she can chew. I doubt she can sustain the control of the approx 7 shops she currently runs.

With slow activity, 1/44 must be struggling to pay the rent. To have one young girl there, on her own, on several days is very poor management, IMO.

Having said that, my experiences at 1/44 recently have been pleasurable

Hard you are correct, Lily actually told me that it has only started making money this year. She would actually be better to have less shops, keep them cleaner and concentrate on making them busier. Great service from Lily of she likes you though!

Lily tells me she is down to 5 shops now, but that she is too busy studying 3 - 4 days a week to manage them. A couple of these places really do need a clean out, then a clean up as Sparksy says. I did visit the Glebe shop once, but had such feeling of "discomfort" from the conditions, I got off the table just before proceedings commenced and baled out with a small tip to the massage girl for me inconveniencing her. !!

I think she has been at Glebe for at least 6 years. It was a legit Kahuna massage place before at 287, then I think Lily took over straight after that.

Shops that Lily used to have but are no longer running are 62 erskine st, 199 Clarence, nerida st Chatswood, 88 Hampden, 

I believe her current shops include 44 Hampden, 375 George, 189 Kent, 287 Broadway and another on George st closer to Chinatown end.

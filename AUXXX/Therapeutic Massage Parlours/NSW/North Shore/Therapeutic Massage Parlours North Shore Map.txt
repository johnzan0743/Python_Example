Excellent work Charles, but ...

The address for Pinkberry massage needs updating. I understand it has moved from Bondi Junction to somewhere in Chatswood. 32 Spring St Bondi Junction is now known as Cherry Massage.

PS. Is Epping classified as North Shore or Northern Suburbs?

Thanks EG, but all I'm doing is taking the information from thread headings. Doing these maps is a lot of work, which I'm squeezing in when I have the time. I can't search through the threads to check their accuracy. 

As well, I'm not sure that its my place to make changes. I have noticed what appear to be a few inaccuracies with some addresses but, since the mods have seen fit to leave the thread heading unchanged I don't see it as my place to second guess them. 

I'm not sure about the Epping one. I've noticed there are a couple of places that seem to be listed in the wrong area but, again, I'm just recording the information as it's listed.

Yes good work Charles. Maps like these used to be a feature on the forum but seem to have disappeared in the last few years. It is a lot of work to keep them updated... good on you

Yes, I've always found the maps to be very useful but they've stopped functioning, and it seems the mod who originally created them is no longer part of the site (and no-one else knows how to maintain them). Accordingly I thought it would be a good idea to create new ones.

And I thank you for your work. It shows a great dedication to the cause ... 

It is a pity that the earlier maps disappeared into the ether because they had the boundaries of the different regions included as well as the shops. I wonder if any of the current mod team know the basis of the division - whether by suburb or LGA.

Fantastic Charles. I'll find this very useful so much appreciated. 

In regard to the pinkberry massage comment, they are on my wechat and the address is advertised as 22 Thomas st chatswood. 

And just quietly, some of the girls look stunning. I'm hoping they are genuine pics.

Is there any way for these super-handy maps to be crowd-sourced - that is, several,users adding and updating places to them - in order to spread the load among a few of us?

Yes, I found this a useful feature as well. Unfortunately I don't know what the basis for making the divisions is or how to include this in the maps, (although it may be obvious once you have that info??)

I provided the account details to the mods when I first set it up. They are probably in the best position to decide if this is appropriate and who to give access to.

We are just about to start some upgrading in the 'backend' and adding some new features for the Forum, so we will have to put embedding the maps on the back burner for the time being. Our time will be limited and it may not be compatible with what we are doing it, so it may have to be re done anyway. Rest assured will will get on to it as soon as we can.

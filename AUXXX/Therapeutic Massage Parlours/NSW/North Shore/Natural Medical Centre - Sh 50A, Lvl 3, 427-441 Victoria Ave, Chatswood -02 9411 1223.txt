Was in the mood to take a punt on the weekend. The body was feeling a bit sore, and wouldn't have said no to some extras if they were on offer, so I thought I would give this place a go.

Even though it is located in a small shopping centre, I had a gut feeling there may be additional services available.

Entered and was greeted by a 50+ ML. Shown a curtained off area and told to strip down to my undies. OK...looked at this stage this was only going to be a massage.

After a couple of minutes the ML returned and began what I would consider to be a pretty good massage - not the best I have ever had but certainly not a bad one.

If all the previous signs had indicated that extras were not on offer, this was confirmed when she treated the area covered by my boxers as if they were covered by land mines.

So basically, good massage but no chance of any extras. Then again, if extras were on offer I would have declined them from this ML anyway.

Cheers,

BAB

Thanks for taking one for the team here.  I had to google the address as there are a few place like this in Victoria avenue that have,...well shall we say "hidden surprises".

I'll make note of this one and avoid it, unless of course I am seeking a 50yo 8/10 massage.

Even more Thai in Chatswood

We if we had another TOFTT month, I've just TOFTT

Just what Chatswood needs yet another Thai massage joint . It never ceases to amaze me how these places stay in biz. This place I noticed from the train and while the address is in the arcade, the main entrance is on Orchard Rd facing the bus interchange and railway. I think it's been here a while but so far, un-reviewed AFAIK.

However, if you're looking for erotic action, I reckon you'll be disappointed. If though, you're after a good massage, you'll probably be happy. I entered in anticipation. Greeted by 3 ladies one (probably the owner) who could have been 60 another, probably around 40 and a third, late 20s maybe? I was assigned the middle one who led me to the 'room' actually a bamboo enclosure with a curtain. "Take off your clothes and leave on your underpants" I should have walked. But a worthwhile massage never goes astray so I complied.

'Ms 40' commenced with a reasonable treatment. After around 15mins a woman entered the shop and requested therapeutic attention obviously from 'Ms 40' because I suddenly  and almost seamlessly - felt a colder pair of hands the old switcheroo 

After some minutes, the switch asked if the pressure was OK. I raised my head and smiled "You've changed" The 20something smiled back. She proceeded to give a pretty damn good massage, at one stage grappling with my grundies to gain access to upper thighs . It's probably just wishful thinking to imagine this lovely as a player particularly with the total lack of privacy here. However, later in the evening and in absence of the grannies, things just might change. Open til 9pm says something. She was quite lovely, chatting afterwards (the grannies were otherwise engaged), giving me tea and suggesting I book, if requesting her. I may just try sometime, to test the theory 

BTW, her name is Pat (yeah, right) and works "Monday to Friday".

Hi All

Anyone know anything about this place or tried it? I walked past yesterday and saw it was there, have not noticed it previously. Sign on the door says no sexual services and the sign writing looks pretty legit. Of course there are plenty of other places in Chatswood with similar signs and plenty of sexual activity happens as either R&T or other.

Thanks

Def legit. I did a review somewhere here a long time ago... 'Pat' was her name...

Of course, it may have changed to keep up with all the other Chatswood 'legitimacy'...

As I recall, Annie's was a massage place on the Pacific Highway at Crows Nest, but well down the hill from Serenity - heard it was legit but that Annie was not above happy endings, due in part to competition and customer expectations.

Not sure of the truth of that but for what it's worth, seems she has relocated to Alexander Street Crows Nest (assume it's the same Annie, haven't visited) - number 47A, which is directly across from Woolworths (specifically the car park exit) and upstairs.

Very detailed flyer listing all sorts of massages and beautician treatments, plus opening hours which don't extend past 5pm, indicate this is a legit store - but again, if it's the same Annie then there might be a happy ending if that's your thing after a 'proper' massage.

Oops - seems I am mistaken, there is Anne's Thai Massage on the Pacific Highway (still open) and this shop, they're two completely different places.

I've just had a look at this place, and this a very serious legit looking place.

The list of ailments that she will attend to is impressive and swings to both extremes, from Prostatitis to problems with ladies Mammary Glands.

If you want a tug, I think you will have to stick to the old tried and truly tested places.  This place will not replace 55 Alexander (sigh) is my guess.

Your radar si still awesome, as there is not a lot of advertising.

Yeah, the combo of treatments, glossy brochure and non-evening hours all indicated 'LEGIT' ... there's of course a place for legit massage shops, it's just nice to be able to get a really good massage in a really clean well-equipped and professional-grade shop with the bonus on a tug and more. My gold standard for that remains Natalie at Tiandi in Chatswood.

This shop at 47A is Zhangs Massage which was located inside Crows Nest Plaza, shop 29, opposite Umea Japanese grocery shop. They have relocated as are various shops from the Plaza - which will become a Coles development. Zhangs is strictly legit with male and female masseurs. I should add that I tried a number of times to subtly corrupt the young milf at Zhangs over the years, all without a modicum of success. !!

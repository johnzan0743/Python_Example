An odd one I found in the Mosman Daily... Called ahead for a booking, without ever seeing the shop.

The shop set up is extremely legit.  Cosmetic goods for sale, and the lot.  But since I booked and my back did hurt... why not.  Opted for the 1hr massage for $70.

The entire massage was professional.  A towel to cover, and a really good massage.  Towards the end I asked for a thigh rub... because they were sore, wink wink.  But she couldn't take the hint.  So to encourage her along, I gave myself a few quick tugs.  No complains, but no helping hands either.  So I took care of business, and she happily cleaned me up.  But that's about it.

So this is pretty much a 'self-service' place, Waterbottle? Sounds odd for a place so 'legit' but nice that she happily cleaned you up!

 3 Spit Rd, Mosman

Thought I might try out the massage place at 3 Spit Road, Mosman, which sounds at least interesting; so walked upstairs to find an extremely clean entrance room with lots of stacked towels and the door open to a good-looking massage room.   The pretty young Thai girl asked what I wanted, and I closed for the 60 minutes Thai massage for $47 (no doubt extras would follow).   She showed me into the room, and said - oh, dear! - 'Take off your clothes, leave on your underclothes and lie down.'   I had walked into what turned out to be the Orchid Thai massage rooms, highly respectable.   The Thai girl, who under other circumstances I'd have had stripped in ten minutes, gave me hell.   I came out feeling twenty years younger, but it wasn't quite what I expected.   Motto: watch the house numbers and learn to count.

Yes, no extras there. Unless nowadays you count a REALLY good massage as an extra, which on occasion I do.

I go there often, just for the massage as they do wonders for my shoulders, neck and upper back that tend to be stiff from too much typing.
If the stiffness is elsewhere, i go elsewhere 

The pretty young Thai girl that massaged you was probably Nui and yes she knows what she is doing (= remedial massage) and is actually very sweet when you get to know her (and I have to stress this, there will be no extras regardless how well you know her). I've been there about 20 times over the last year.

The others there do a very good massage as well, but shes the only really young girl I've seen (though I haven't been there on each day of the week).

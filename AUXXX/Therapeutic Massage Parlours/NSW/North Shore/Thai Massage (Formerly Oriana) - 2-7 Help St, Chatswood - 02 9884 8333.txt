 Thai Massage (Formerly Oriana) - 2/7 Help St, Chatswood - 02 9884 8333
				
Post Content: 
Hi All,

Well, somebody had to go there, and seeing as this was once my favourite place, I took the plunge today.  Checking that there were no council stooges hanging around the front, I went in to find the place exactly as I'd left it earlier in the year.  Same pebble tiles at the door, same boot/shoe cupboard.  Upstairs, and all familiar, with a Korean receptionist.  This is where its changed.  The 'wet' area is now ladies only, the former massage area is now a thai massage.  All owned by new management apparently.  $49 for 60, plus $20 for oil (plus GST) meant $76 for the hour, which I took with the very lovely looking Om.

The doors in the small rooms that once were a hotbed of bbbj and cim are now gone, replaced with what can only be described as a large hanky.  Enough to stop wandering eyes, but thats all.  Definitely no HJs here and 120% legit.  Om asks me to strip to my undies, and she of course is rugged up better than Captain Oates on a cold day 

I lie on the massage table, which has replaced those beds with the nuclear powered electric blankets so favoured by the korean mls that once worked here.  There followed an EXCELLENT proper thai massage - nothing special to report other than Om knows her stuff.

Some other titbits gleaned from the excellent Om include the fact that she works here 6 days, even though she owns her own place at Kings Cross - Healthy Thai Massage opposite the station - one I'm not familiar with, strictly legit also.

Also, her partner is opening another Thai massage in Lindfield, very soon.  She wasn't sure the address but said it was on the main road, ie the Pacific Hwy.  Not sure if this is going to be 'full body' massage or not.

Finally, she was lamenting the difficulty in getting Thai girls to do these jobs - she thinks immigration has tightened up on Thais entering the country, so a smaller pool of students to choose from - can anyone confirm this theory?

A few Thai girls I know have been have had trouble getting their visa's extended recently. They've mentioned its been happening to all their friends and most are going, or have gone back to Thailand.

Hi n111
note that this place hasnt been taken over by Thai - its still korean owned and run - just that the thai massage is now in the old massage rooms.  Om was having a whinge about the noise they make - she needs tranquil music and peace for the thai massage, but quite often they are piping k pop through the speakers, and walking around yapping away.  

Probably best to give this place a wide berth until things settle down (shame because Om is a lovely girl) - they'll have to open up the washrooms to men soon, there just isn't enough custom for women only.

Re. the availability of Thai girls ... the crack down is more on international students coming here doing dubious courses run by shonky operators. As a result of that crack down it is harder for working girls to get student visas. An unintended consequence maybe ... or maybe not. It also led to a lot of immigrants over-staying their visa. Estimated at 50,000 v. a few hundred boat people.

I know I would rather have the 50000 illegal immigrants who over stay their welcome than these shonky welfare sucking boat people. At least the majority of the 50000 are actually working, studying and having a crack at living legitimately.

Enough of a rant about the ridiculous political trends that this country adopts.

I am a newly converted thai girl lover and want some more of the sexy young things that have had my eyes popping out and my little bro blowing his mind recently.

There was a DA approved by Kuring-Gai council some months back for a Thai Massage place at 348 (I think) Pacific Hwy Lindfield. There is a sign on the front of the building saying "Duval's Building". I think I posted about it on this forum. When I have been visiting Lindfield, I have kept an eye on the progress. The Thai massage DA was for the back half of the top floor. The front half has opened as a gym - Fit Evolution or some such. The back of the building has been painted, the lift shown on the plans has been built, but last time I walked past (4 weeks or so ago), the signs indicated yoga and martial arts for the back half of the top floor (that is martial, not marital ...)

But EMP's info could be about another place altogether ...

Nope. Pretty much the same here. I ventured out here on the weekend. Got a standard massage with absolutely no hint of any extras on offer. Had to wear special shorts during the whole thing that cut off your circulation. It was supposed to be a Thai massage, but I'm positive the girl was Chinese (not Thai) and the massage was every bit as non-Thai. Oh well... better places to go. Prices are $55 for 'Thai' massage and they charge $20 more if you want oil.

Looks like the Lindfield place has opened. It's next to Evolution fitness and above the dry cleaners. Appears to be entrance off Pacific Highway and also one up the stairs at the back. Sign says 'Lindfield Massage', there was a phone number on the sign at the back but I didn't catch it. Wonder if this will stay in the Pure Massage section or do we have a new starter.
Incidentally, there is also a new massage shop outside Lindfield station on the highway but it look like one of those legit ones you see in shopping malls.

It is easy to get extras here. But they will say no at reception, and they will also make you wear these stupid pyjama type underpants at first. But you can take them off about 5 minutes and inform you girl you want an extra (ie. hand job.) There are a couple of girls who will also go nude. 

The other thing you can do is have a shower and sauna (on the right hand side).  Sometimes you have to ask a couple of times, because they are worried they will be shut down. When they realise you are not from the council, they will treat you differently.

Assuming the ML gets 50% of this price I cant see a young Korean girl working for this sort of money. Massage is not an easy job. I am sure all ML's at this hush hush place must be offering at a minimum offering basic extras to make this job worth their while. Just my 2 cents worth. Also to clarify - I have not been here since it got busted but soon I will hearing that others have been getting some extra benefits. Money talks behind close doors

If you go to the Oriana, you need to be confident and persistent when asking for extras. I tend to just walk in the shower area as if it is the old days, and they don't object. 

The problem is that there are a couple of women who will only do straight  massage. They are in the minority. However, if you think you are stuck with one of those, you need to terminate the session early and just ask for your money back. They will either hand back your money, or they will offer another girl for you.

Dropbeer, any names as to who offers extra's.. I went the other week and copped this woman built like an elephant..  horrible.. today i tried again and got quite a cute young girl but completely objected when i suggested removing my underpants.. decent massage but i am not going to keep paying $75 for straight massage..

Mate, to be honest I didn't take notice of the names, but they are the younger hotties, not the older girls. 

At first you have to wear underpants but then you need to take them off after about 5 minutes. Don't ask, just do it. If she strongly objects, then you just say you are terminating the session and go to the front desk for a full refund. You can either take the money and leave and come back another day, or they will offer you another girl. You just have to be assertive because they are paranoid you might be from the Council trying to shut them down. 

Another good trick is to just walk straight into the shower area as if you own the place and quickly get into the shower or sauna. That way they know you are a regular. There are also some baths which are very relaxing. 

Don't pay $75 for a straight massage there, that is crazy.

I am now giving up on this shop even though I am always up for a challenge. I suppose a heap of visits may change things but it is not worth the upfront investment.
I tried all the above and more.
Walked straight in the shower and they stopped me and said it was for ladies only. I said I come here all the time and always use it.
The young girl told me to keep undies on and I said I dont were any. I said dont worry and the girls always look after me.
Had 1.5 hr massage and no signs of tickle tackle. I also asked at the end of the session and got a straight NO we dont do that.
I went in at 10pm on Friday night and until 12pm there was no customers.
Seriously I dont know how this place survives we the cost of rent and the prices they charge.
I hope someone else takes over soon at gets a proper license and brings it back to its glory days.

Thanks for another TOFTT, Spoof.

You're spot-on... I fondly remember the glory days! But now there is infinitely better value elsewhere and until they get over their paranoid aftermath of the Council bust, it's a ridiculous exercise just for the vague or occasional hope of a 'community' shower or steam room experience.

They would already have that. According to all their licences, none of the massage shops in Chatswood are licenced for 'sexual services'. They are legit massage licences only. By definition, a massage shop with MLs performing 'happy endings' is a brothel the way the law is worded. Yes... ridiculous I know. That is why industry stirrers like Chris Seage once claimed "18 illegal brothels in Chatswood". (I guess he's lost count by now!!!)

Given Oriana history and the fact that there's a legal brothel just around the corner, they have as much chance of getting a brothel licence as I have of rooting the Duchess of Cambridge

Guys if you do go to Oriana, you MUST establish about 5-10 mins into the massage whether she will give you rub and tug.  Then if she says no, that is when you go to the desk and they will give you your money back. But you cant get money back if you have already had the massage. The rule is simple - no rub and tug, then no pay.  

Also, when going into the sauna area, don't worry if they try to stop you. Just keep going and quickly get into one of the showers or sauna. They just give up in the end, trust me they are not going to drag you naked out of the shower. 

The worst thing that can happen is you get a 5-10 minute massage and a sauna for free. And on a good day, you get the service that you want. Remember it is not their fault, they dont really want to enforce these rules.

Its not and I have learned my lesson the hard $$$$ way. The only reason I was persisent is because it used to be one of my fav places and they open late.
Too much effort and then too much disapointment.

I will stick with Smiling Angels when I am in Chatswood and there is a Thai Shop next door that opens until 10pm. $60 1/2 hr nude.

Right next door to the entrance to Smiling Angels.
When you walk up the stairs you see the door to Smiling Angels on the right. To the left of the smiling angels door is another door which you have to go up another set of stairs.
The doors are say 1-2 meters apart.
You wont notice it unless you look for it - as it looks like it is actually part of smiling angels.

The only reason I bumped into it - is becuase I went to Smiling Angels around 9 pm one night and there door was not open. However the door to the left was - to be honest I thought I was going there but was pleasantly surprised it was a new place. I think it has only been open for a couple of months.

They were busy that night so the owner (who is quite nice) gave me the massage part first and then another girl came later to finish me off. To be honest the 2nd girl was not my type but she got me across the line. I actually wanted the owner to end the session for me.

I trust this all makes sense.

Just to clarify the above. I know there are 2 doors to smiling angels but you will notice a 3rd door all the way to the left.

I poked my head in here not long after it opened. There is a bathroom with a spa (which was empty) and a very small sauna (which was turned off). Massage tables were separated by curtains. Nothing about the place made much sense to me, it all looked very cheap and doesnt appeal as a legit or r'n't shop. Maybe some sort of tax right-off?

Went there last week to check out and it's still the same $75 per hour all legit, massage was ordinary and not worth $75.
I tried to get into the sauna area but was unsuccessful.... Because that's for women only.

 Vital Massage - 3/341 Victoria Ave, Chatswood - 02 9419 5225
				
Post Content: 
Establishment's Name: Vital Massage
Contact Details/Address: 3/341 Victoria Avenue, Chatswood - ph (02) 9419 5225
This is an old three-story red brick apartment block directly next to the car park for Chatswood Chase. There's limited parking at the rear of the block during the day, but after hours there's plenty to go around. Vital is on the ground floor.
Hours of Business: 10am to 9pm, although if you rock up close to 9pm you might find they're taking no bookings - 9pm is more their closing time.[/B]
Prices: $35 for 30 minutes; $45 for 45 minutes; $55 for 60 minutes; $80 for 90 minutes. Extras are sometimes included and sometimes extra - in my experience at least, it depends on the lady - when they are extra, it's around the normal $20 for a happy ending.

Vital was for a long time a regular haunt of mine, although in the past two years it became less frequent due to changed work and travel habits and the competition from Albany and Tiandi.

Albany was, in those days of Mina, the place for fun with a capital F. At the very very least one could rely on a highly sensual massage and tug, and we all know the menu went well beyond that.

Tiandi, on the other hand, was a superb massage with a superb happy ending - no extras (at least not from Tiandi owner Natalie, who was the only one I ever saw there) but one of the best value 'straight' rub+tug sessions I ever encountered.

So Vital, which had a good massage and good tug (depending on the lady)  ended up sorta caught between the Tiandi and Albany options.

None the less, I still dropped in from time to time which retained something resembling 'regular' status there - at least enough so that owner Linda always remembered me and was always happy to look after me, but also generally made sure that other ladies took care of me if she was unavailable.

But in the past two months I've had the opportunity to visit Vital a few times, so thought these reviews might prove useful for others.

Vital is still facing some solid competition locally, with the revamped 29A Neridah doing well and North Star (43 Neridah) also stepping up its offerings.

The women at Vital are mostly in their 30s and only average lookers. You do stand a good chance of getting a good massage with a happy ending  but you can't rely on it being a 'sensual' experience, and there's only the smallest chance of any extras, even to the lady letting you touch her. In short: the 'rub' is probably better than you'll get at most 'massage' places, but probably not the 'tug', and certainly not the menu of extras.

I know there are some punters who seek a good massage  an actual therapeutic 'remedial' massage  with the bonus of the happy ending. That's pretty much what you can count on at Vital Massage. But for a more 'sensual' rub-and-tug experience with the option to go further, there are many far more reliable propositions.

So, that's the intro - now on with the reviews!

Name: Anne
Age: early 20s
Size/shape: tall and slim
Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Anne is a pretty young thing: a real sweet 'good girl' type. You all know the sort  to look at her butter wouldn't melt in her mouth, even though  your male hardness melts in her hands!

Anne's massage is not quite in the 'good' category. I'd place her more as 'decent', so maybe 6/10 or 7/10 at best - she's not up to the standard of Vital's Linda or certainly not Natalia at Tiandi (two of my benchmarks for a good massage) but it's 'good enough' and certainly better than the odd aimless stroking which some girls try to pass off for massage.

The tug was in the same league - decent, good but not ball-blowingly great, and that not helped by the total lack of any extras beyond the tug, not even touching her boobs, let alone getting her gear off - a shame, as she's got a nice young firm rack. But there's still something delightful about having this sweet gentle young thing giving you a happy ending for all it's worth. And there was no extra money asked outside of the $55 for the one hour session.

Name: Linda
Age: 40s
Size/shape: medium height and slim
Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Linda runs Vital and she does a quite good massage, I'd rate this 8/10.

She's not a 'looker' so don't go for the eye-candy - and her track record for tugs is hit-and-miss from what other visitors have told me, so she's not one to see if you 100% want a tug. I get the tug because I'm an established regular of hers, and it's a good job, but there are no other 'extras' on offer. Linda tends to be there for the afternoon and evenings through to 9pm. So $55 will get you a good massage for one hour but you may well not get the tug, which gives Natalie at Tiandi the edge (a better massage and a great tug guaranteed, in better rooms, and even for $5 less!).

Name: Lily
Age: 40s
Size/shape: medium height, a bit chubby (most noticeably around the tum) 
Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Lily is another example of how the older ladies who have neither age nor head-turning looks on their side can still deliver good value in rubtug land.

Her massage is good, maybe 7.5/10, and certainly relaxing enough. Early on I'm wondering if she's going to offer a tug at all - or if so, if it migt just be the more perfunctory effort to finish off the massage.

But then, when she starts working on my backside, she lets her hands slide down the tops of my thighs, gently pulling back the buns and rubbing her hands back up along their inner edge, just brushing in a way that ceases my suspicions  yes, I realise that Lily is up for it, and not only that but she's not going to wait until I turn over to ask if I want a 'special massage'. She's getting me into gear early on.

The massage continues with the backside and legs and tights, and in between all that some more stroking and touching and probing, until she leans down and asks if I want a happy ending  well, I figure it's a bit late to bother asking now, this is barely an option and not really up for disagreement! So I concur and relax, and then follows what must be 10 long languid minutes as Lily works her way over my thighs, crack and sack, driving me up to welcome heights of arousal. It's an extended bout of foreplay and I'm the one who eventually suggests I turn over!

I didn't ask for Lily to strip (as she's not that appealing) but she's okay for hands to roam over top, then work my way up from under, ease a boob out of a very padded cup for some breast and nipple play, but Lily moves away a little to indicate she wants no more than that - although when I move hand down to run around her backside and along her slit through pants she is not only fine with my gentle fingerings but even enthusiastic in how she moves hips, although maybe she also suspects this will get me over the line  which it certainly does, with a little gentle anal rimming at the very end.

There's a tip expected for that service, and I have no qualms with this - I'd offer her $20 but as it happens, I've forgotten to visit the ATM and so all I have is a $50 and a $20, which totals $70 - and the on hour massage commands $55 of that. I offer up the $70 and hope she's not offended by only $15 as a tip, but she smiles and accepts this happily. Fair enough!

So, that's a sampling of three ladies at Vital. If you're in the area and want to try them out, it should be clear that YMMV in the extreme - and to be honest, I'd suggest a trip to the nearby 29A Neridah or 43 Neridah, or to Tiandi at the other side of the station. All three have better rooms and generally a better chance of a tug (lthough that's not a 100% thing at 29A), and sometimes more (at 29A and 43) if that's what you seek.

Yep, I know the place - and I'm sorry to say that the fetching young Anne does do happy endings, although they're not that great - she's a bit workmanlike in her approach.

Honestly, I had high hopes but the HJ was average, no touching at all, and much of the appeal was of this young cutie who had almost an 'innocent girl next door' look (IMHO) doing the tug, when I knew that later she'd be sitting at some cafe and if I'd not known her and wandered into the cafe I'd be thinking "Hmmm, nice..." and here she was, tugging me off!

Anyway, this is where the whole YMMV thing comes into play. This shop - named Vital Massage - is a bit like that, some of the ladies do a happy ending and do it very well, the odd one or two in the past have done low-level extras (top off and touching, but no BJ or FS for sure!) but there just as many instances where a happy ending is inconsistenty offered - some customers get it, others don't.

So yeah, if you want to be sure of a tug to follow the rub, there are plenty of other places to go (especially in Chatswood).

I had not ventured to this place in a while, so decided it was time to get reacquainted. It doesnot appear that Linda is there any more as there was another large lady who appeared to be in charge. I was not offered a choice of ML and was given what could best be described as a MIWLF. she was dowdy wearing glasses and unattractive. I however am no oil painting so the show went on!

The massage itself was sensational i have always believed that the more unattractive the ML the better the massage. There was subtle times throughout that more was on offer, questions such as "should I massage here" pointing at my old fella. 
I could not bring myself to ask for the HJ, but in the end with much merriment on the MLs face, I closed my eyes and allowed the inevitable to happen. There was no eroticism in the finish, more like attempting to wring out a towel, or open a bottle! But the deed was done, and I left drained, but perhaps not fulfilled.

So, would I go back? Probably not.
The cost was $55 and I left $20 for the tug, just for the effort.
If I got her name, I have tried to blank it from my memory.
The massage however was excellent, I did however have my eyes closed from beginning to end.

Person's Name: Lilly

Date of Visit:  12 July 2012

Prices: $35 30min + $20 tip for happy ending

Age: 40s

Size/shape: Around 155cm, Milfish figure

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: RNT

Value for money/recommend?: Yes

My experience/comments: 

I've seen Lilly a number of times at this shop. She is a short lady, figure looks ok however she tends to wear loose tops over jeans which may be hiding a bit of a tummy. Boobs are B to C cup. 

Lilly's massage is very good she can get my shoulders and neck to loosen up and I always leave the session more relaxed. She seems to get a few bookings so must be doing something right. On to the tug and this is also right on the money, unrushed and good two handed technique. Will sometimes swap her hands around and do the corkscrew technique as well as  gently touching the tip - certainly knows what she is doing.

Her english is basic but from what I have gathered from our chats in a mix of english and chinese is she is a nice lady and works hard to please her customers. I've never asked for extras beyond the HJ. This shop tends to be more conservative in that area and focuses more on the massage. If you are looking for a good massage with a quality tug I can recommend Lilly.

Dropped by here last week, being in Chatswood and thinking it might be nice to do a little TOFTT effort with any nice new lady at this place.

Alas, only Linda (who goes NO further than a straight tug, and doesn't even do that for many new customers) plus the same two ladies she usually seems to have, both of whom I've seen and neither do much for me, so I gave it a miss ...

Sorry, the post above got cut off!

In the past Vital's been a bit hit-and-miss – you always get a tug (well, with some exceptions, eg Linda on a first visit), but it's very rare to get any sort of looker there, especially in the potential MILF age bracket.

Linda does get some slightly younger ones on from time to time, and they're usually more pleasing to the eye even if it's in a 'girl next door' way, but they may or may not be much at the tug, or even the massage, let alone availability of extras.

That said, over the years I've been going here I've stumbled across the odd good one, but they don't seem to stay very long, maybe they realise they can get more business and make more money at other places. And it's that which makes me drop by every now and again.

Except that when I drop by in the early evening (my usual time, after an early dinner at Chatswood) Linda never seems to have any news girls on, but she always tells me that she had a new girl that day who left earlier, and then runs through a list of the other new girls she has coming in tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after - basically, every day except the one I'm visiting on. And of course, she says they're all "very young girl, new girl, very good".

Well, this time I was in Chatswood around noon, had lunch and dropped by Vital around 1.30pm, thinking I was certain to get one of the new girls. But no, it's just Linda and the other two regulars, so I decline – although Linda assures me "We had new girl yesterday, also new girl working tomorrow, very young, very good, you come back tomorrow?"... No thanks, Linda, you always say you have new young girls but they never seem to be there when I drop by! :P

I'd mostly agree with Flyboy in his last post. Linda's business is a stock standard legit massage shop that provides the occasional extra benefit. For this visit here  after probably 3 years  I decided, having been poorly of health lately, I wanted a gentle therapeutic treatment. Any 'benefit' would have to be equally gentle but was not essential. I first met Linda Lees at Shop 19 in the Victoria Plaza when she was very green... how many years ago is that??? I remind her of this and she's impressed that I still remember her. I don't remind her of the good tug she administered there to a background of clanging washing machines! (Has that place changed at all?!) I also saw her when she briefly ran the business at 43/47 Neridah St. Anyway... here at Vital, it is sweet young Anne who attends to my 'treatment'. She may be the same Anne reviewed near the thread top... if so, she has improved markedly IMHO. Simply, great rub, great tug.

Anne tells me she's been here about 3 years and works 5 days a week. It is proper treatment I get... a proper massage during which she finds and treats several trauma spots. First class. My health means I'm still coughing a fair bit as she stirs up the body tissues  she's very attentive to ensure that I'm remaining OK.

After turning over at around 50 minutes, Anne smiles to me and motions 'extra'? I agree to an additional toll. There's no nude action here but despite such a sweet, demure nature, Anne certainly knows the requirements of the 'tightest of muscle problems'. Her hand action is frankly, superb. Just the right amount of lubricant, the pressure, speed, stroke length... all exceptional. She also allows me to gently stroke her nether girly bits through her tights . Within a few minutes I have ejaculated enough jizz for a lifetime of sperm donations. Absolutely bloody beautiful.

Anne cleans up with tissues then hot towels. She is so gentle yet efficient. She gets me some water while I dress... to tip, I have only a pineapple to which she insists on change and returns with $30 back. I emerge from the room to sing her praises to Linda who, in turn, sees me to the door shaking my hand profusely. Such lovely people...

This old fart's health has improved significantly lately such that I am just about to launch back into my comprehensively devious modus operandi... which I know you all have grown to love and expect... .  First, a few HJs to get the juices flowing again are called for. In truth however, today I had every intention of a full-on punt until the gestapo decided she needed to join me on my excuse of a visit to the grog shop. Faaarrkk...#@%&*. Well we went to the grog shop but then I insisted on the need for a massage to follow... "It's my back, carrying all that piss that you will drink." She went shopping, of course. Women...

This review could almost be a cc of the one above with Anne, albeit with a somewhat older ML. So, there's little point in repeating every little detail. Kit is highly accomplished, suffice to say. The massage was superb... she had asked what was the problem to which I resisted the temptation to reply, "I have a raging boner which you could ease for me... preferably with your mouth or your pussy..." But you know I'm a gentleman... 

I did have some issues with low back and hips... which she worked over very well. But her skill in the end game was the class act... superb gluteus rub and tackle tickle, complete with 'reach-through' and the gentle slide of digits up and down the crack 

After the flip-over and without ever asking for $$, she performed a most exquisite tug. Of course it's been a while, so anything would have been bloody marvellous relief but Kit provided the goods... in spades. Well actually, I provided the jizz in what felt like buckets... 

Nude is off the menu here at Linda's but still, all good... always polite, the usual comprehensive clean-up with hot towels, the room was warm and cosy... just a great place to relieve some stress and empty the cods. I tipped Kit a lobster.

If you like the sound of this, she works Fridays and Saturdays.

My experience/comments : 

Was travelling in the area for work and had a spare hr, saw the sign out the front so decided to have a quick massage.

Walked in, looks very much like a legit massage place and was greeted by Linda who seems to be the boss lady there.  Asked for a 30 mins massage for $35, place was busy so she offered me the only lady available.

Didn't get her name, she was a Chinese lady in her mid/late 30s.  Not a great looker(5/10), shoulder length slightly permed hair and probably a size 12.

She shows me to the room, which was nicely decorated and quite clean and left me to undress.  I wasn't sure whether this place was legit or not, so I undressed and left my undies on and hopped onto the table.

She comes in and starts an oil massage, I actually had sore legs so I had her concentrate on my legs.  Massage was quite good, very firm and she knew what she was doing.  About 10 mins in, I could feel her arm subtly touching my ass/balls over my undies.  That went on for a few mins and then very un-subtly she asked me out right, "You want Handjob? 20 more?"  Well it was pretty clear what's on offer here, so I promptly took up her offer.

She removed my undies and started oiling up my balls with her right hand and moving her finger tips up and down my back with her left.   She gives my ball sack quite a bit of attention, gently rubbing it and giving it an occasional light squeeze.  I was rocking a semi at that point and in a slow well practised manoeuvre, the hand went from the balls to cock.  After a few jerks and she was satisfied my cock was hard, she asked me to turnover.

She was about to put more oil on my cock, but I stopped her and asked if she'll blow me for an extra 20.  She said no, cos she didn't have a condom and started to oil my cock up.

While she was jerking, I lifted her t shirt up and had some fun with the tits.  She seems a bit surprised when i went behind her bra and touched her nips.  She didn't resist, but gave a gasp and a light moan.  

I accepted her offer to take all her clothes off for an extra $20, nothing special really, B size tits that's still firm, very un-asian like nipples which were very light in color.  Nice ass, but pussy was a bit unkempt for my taste.

She continued to jerk me off while I played with her tits a bit, I sat up on the table and gave her nipples a suck.  Sensing no resistance, I really went to town with her.  Rubbing her clit with my right hand and sucking her tits, while she continues to jerk me off.  She seemed to get well into it, heavy breathing and moaning, clearly she haven't had any for a while 

At one point, I even got her to lie down on the table with her pussy spread, while i rubbed her off and while sucking on her tits.  Time was up, she said I needed to finish and had me lie back on the table.  A few more minutes of cock rubbing and I was ready to blow.  I think it caught her by surprise when I shot a giant load while she was still jerking, cos after I was done blowing she had her left eye closed and was busying cleaning her face and hair.

hahah, she didn't duck in time and caught one on the face!!!   Well the usual clean up followed and left after giving her the $40.

All in all, it wasn't bad value.  $35 for 30 mins massage + $40 tips for HJ, tit/pussy play and a CUMSHOT!!!

Had to come back later to be able to get a massage by Linda but she could give me only 1/2 hr because she had another appointment. So if I wanted a longer session another girl could replace Linda to finish the job. The massage from Linda was pretty good and straight. She treated my upper and lower back as I asked and half an hour passed very quickly. I elected to have another 15 minutes with a different girl as I felt relaxed but not fully. The other girl went straight to work: turn over please followed by copious amount of baby oil on my balls and the old fellow. All this was followed by a rather mechanical HJ. Nothing to talk about and rather disappointing that a nice massage session could not be finished with a really happy ending. The girl worked hard and eventually succeeded but no touching attitude did not help me much. I had a massage with Ci-Ci (?) before in this shop but have been told she went back to China. Ci-Ci's massage was not as good as Linda's but the end was definitely much nicer. At the end Linda promised to give me a 1 hr massage provided I make a booking for her.

Cici has left for her home country China, the last time I saw her she mentioned she was leaving in mid September.  (sorry didn't get a chance to write a review..)

I agreed with Kerim that she's better on the "ending" activity than many other girls in the shop.

    Value for money/recommend? : Yes

    My experience/comments : Was going back to see Cici but was told she has already gone back to China.  Got introduced to another girl called Nancy, average looking but good figures (petite).  I ask for a hard massage and extra care to my shoulders and she did give me the hardest massage I have had for quite some time.  She has got a good attitude and kept checking if I'm happy or not every now and then.

In the 45 minutes mark she started the tickles and I was ready to turn over immediately, she then offered a HJ for $20 which I accepted straight away.  Her technique was exceptional just like her massage skill, right pressure and also not rushing, some touching is also allowed and she has a sexy and playful attitude which made her more special than some others in the area.  I will definitely return to have more fun with her, may be get her naked? 

For $75 you get a decent massage plus a good hj, not bad value indeed.

Back from some travels and seeking that magic combo of a good massage and a good happy ending - a mix that's quite often hard to get.

Opted to head to 3/341 and see who was available and what was on offer.

Landed 'Kit', and she's pretty much as described above – easy enough on the eye, quite a good massage, and an enthusiastic happy ending with some gentle rimming into the deal. Up went her top, out came her boobs, happy for some play with those, and all for just $20 on top of Vital's standard $55/hr deal.

In short, pretty good value, in fact for $75 it's one of the better rub'n'tug deals in Chatswood. But I am always in search for "the best"!

With due defference to Hard, and for quickness, I have "copied" his template from above - your indulgence is requested.

Person's Name : Anne

Establishment : Vital Massage

 Date of Visit : 17/10/2013

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 3/341 Victoria Ave, Chatswood 9419 5225

 Rates : $55 / hour

 Age : 25-ish

 Size/shape : slim, sz 6, 160cm

 Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

 Services Provided : RnT

 Value for money/recommend? : Yes as I have seen her a few times.

I first met Anne at 2/769 about 3 years, or so, ago. She only worked there a short time, as a fill in, and her name there was Apple.

SO, back about 3 years ago ...Not being a person who likes to flail aroud the edge in wonderment I always "tell em what I want" with a touch of animated humour and a good dose of respect to the young ladies ... in this case Apple. So we were both on the same page - then I was on the table - and she delivered very memorably !!!, I was impressed at this sweet young slim girl and vowed to return ........  I did ..... but she was gone and Annie (the owner said - "I know not where")

I spent quite a bit of time during the following months phoning, "dropping in to" various Parlours looking for "Apple". When a phone enquiry produced a "Yes" I would set forth to ascertain "if it was" ... never could find her  ..until .. one day, about a year or more ago I was walking past Vital and "Apple??" walked across in front of me on the street. "Are you Apple?' ..... "NO! ... I am Anne ....now"     QUest over  !!

So I have seen her sporadically over recent time as I also sampled other young and talented ladies.

My most recent visit 17/10/13 was a salient reminder of just how sweet this girl is ... she is slim ..such a pleasant person, a great smile ... Does NOT take her clothes off (fine by me) and gives a very satisfying HJ ,,, as HARD attests to... !!

I like her and treat her with the utmost respect ... I will see her again ...

NB: I suspect I know WHO this Nancy is too --- will confirm soon ... I hope.

My experience/comments : Seen some reviews for this place & was shopping @ The Chase, so called up to see who was working, was hoping Anne bit no luck. They mentioned Nancy &  recognised her name from reviews here.

She mentioned she was from Hong Kong so we chatted about HK & China while she gave me a great hard massage for my back & shoulders, also asked for soft in other areas  

15 mins to go & she began very soft massage up & down my legs & bum, hard on growing!! Then work began on the top of my legs , bum & balls with a nice amount of oil. Turnover time & was asked $20 for HJ or $50 for full nude...Thought I'd see what's underneath.

Nice b cups presented, so while I sucked her light brown nipples she tugged me with precision, all the while with genuine moans of enjoyment.

Finished with a nice head massage.

Spied some other younger, cuties when walking out so there is potential for return.

Date of Visit : 7/11/2013
Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 3/341 Victoria Ave, Chatswood 9419 5225
Rates : $55 / hour
Age : 40+?
Size/shape : slim, sz 6, 160cm, nice rack
Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese
Services Provided : RnT
WIR? : Yes. A good tug.

A quick brief report.

When not in devious mode elsewhere, I often come here to see young Anne who, IMO, provides one of the finest respectable RnT experiences around... excellent massage and satisfying release... with a fund receipt to boot. This day Anne was busy so I opted for anyone else.

Monica could be Anne's mother... by that I mean I think she might be old enough! But that's not a bad thing. Anyway, good massage, same great tug... actually excellent release which emerged with such force that I messed up the front of her top and her neck. I should have used that as an opportunity to chide her for not removing her top... and more. While that service is rarely available here, I did manage to get roving fingers inside her brassiere... nice nips... 

So another well-behaved good tugger in Linda's crop of ladies. Just be aware, I think Monica is husband-hunting... road test her on Wednesdays and Thursdays.

Anne works every day here except Monday and Wednesday.

Anne does deserve the highest level of respect and will not compromise her integrity... i.e., no kit off, no touching! Great tug though...

Person's Name : Kate

Establishment : Vital Massage

Date of Visit : Late November

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Contact Details/Address: 3/341 Victoria Avenue, Chatswood - ph (02) 9419 5225

Hours of Business : 10am to 9pm

Rates : $55 for 1 hour, $20 HJ

Age : 40s

Size/shape : Average

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Very good massage, good happy ending

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Tried this place in Chatswood last week based on good reviews here. Sign out the front said "$55 massage 1 hr" so that seemed good value to start with. Walked in, two ladies in the 'lounge room' of what is obviously a converted flat or office setup, the other apartments on the ground floor also all appear to be "offices" or one type or another. Tenants live on upstairs levels, one old bloke was walking down the stairs as I walked into the bloke, he looked at me heading to #3 door and said "They give you a good handjob there, mate!".

Of the two ladies one was shorter, a bit younger, slightly round face but she handed me over to the other, a bit older and not as attractive, named Kate, maybe it was Kate's turn. Kate has a mole near her mouth and also her teeth are honestly not in the best condition but she has a nice enough manner. I stripped all the way down and lay there face-down starkers, when Kate came back she ran an appreciate hand over my back and bum and legs, then covered backside with a towel, asked where I needed massaged. I said "Just general, all over" and left her to it.

Kate does a really good massage, even though I asked for "medium" it was pretty strong and sometimes actually painful, I am frightened to think what a "hard" massage would be like!!! But it's all good, a lot of digging in and stretching, really "working" the muscle groups, all over your back and leg and shoulders, so it's like a "proper" massage.

Until she finishes the "proper" massage and wipes you down with a warm wet towel of course, the wet towel makes its way around your crack and then her hand follows gently for a few minutes play then "Turn over please" and "You like special massage here?" pointing to the obvious, "$20 okay?" she says.

Kate does a good "happy ending" too, nice shaft and ball work, some encouraging noises but nothing "over the top", I didn't ask her to remove her top or strip down because I don't think it would be worth much, no offence to her.

After I'm done she cleans up, comes back and continues the massage with a head massage, then arms and hands to finish up the hour.

For $55+$20 I walk out one hour later, $75 "poorer" but feeling a lot better for it. Will return here but would like to try a younger lady for whom extra money to go topless or more would be worthwhile.

Person's Name : Monica (?)

Establishment : Vital Massage

Date of Visit : 08/12/2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 3/341 Victoria Avenue, Chatswood - ph (02) 9419 5225

Hours of Business : 10am to 9pm

Rates : $55/1 hr + $20

Age : 40s

Size/shape : slim to medium built

Nationality or Ethnicity : MLC

Services Provided : massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : massage - yes, HJ - ?

My experience/comments : On last Sunday I decided to have a good and strong massage of my upper and lower back, with the emphasis on the massage. 

A quick trip to Chase to park the car and walk over to the building next door where Vital Massage is located. Vital, contrary to Chase, was rather quiet so I managed to get the VIP room (I hate those tiny rooms at the back). All punters must have been spending money somewhere else. 

I was greeted by a ML I have not seen before and she said her name was Monica (?) and that it was her first day at Vital. She spoke a bit of English and, for a change, I could exchange words and ask some questions. Judging from her answers she must have been in Aus for a while. I think she was new at Vital because she did not ask which area needed attention so I asked for medium/hard massage of my  upper and lower back plus some pressure points in my gluteus maximus. 

The massage was reasonable, lots of elbow and knee work trying to untie various knots. At times it felt too strong but I managed to survive. She spent most of the time on my back, followed by pressure points on my back side and then onto my legs. If there was any tt I did not notice it as I was half asleep. On the turnover the towel was placed over my mid section and the ML proceeded to massage my chest and stomach. No incursions into the lower part of my stomach. Then the towel was moved upwards and it barely covered my slowly growing "little kerim". A bit of oil and massage of the thighs commenced. I detected a bit of touching and eventually a shy question whether I would like to spend an extra $20. As I was reasonably happy with the massage I thought why not to finish the lot with something relaxing. 

But that part of the massage was a bit of letdown.  For whatever the reason I started losing "concentration" and my attempts to spice up the experience with something more was received like an invitation to unroll a price list. Maybe the ML had a lousy day and did not make much, maybe the massage was too relaxing and I did not feel like anything too advanterous. In the end she managed to get me over the line but I did not really enjoy it. Maybe the next time would be better. She told me she is there three days per week, if i remeber correctly - W, Th & Sun.

Very soft massage up & down legs then top & my balls - no oil. 
Turnover time & agreed $20 for HJ.
Some comment on MLs who "know their way around a guys body"  Nancy does not!  
Nice and soft to start, then tried to pound the life out of the little master  why do they do that?
When it is obvious that its not working, increasing the speed wont help! 
Even with instructions, she has no idea!
Give it a miss guys!

My experience/comments : Enjoying this place in Chatswood, Linda has a good team of ladies, mostly older but know how to give a good  strong massage followed by enthusiastic tug.

Went in without appointment around 2.30 & greeted by Co Co, hadn't seen her around before, friendly nature & nice smile & strong lower legs (strong calves which looked sexy in her small boots)

Asked what I'd like....strong on shoulders & back with sexy also.

Did not disappoint, massage with oil was very strong with some brushing off the crack & sac. Then hot towel to wipe off oil & the feather like touches begin from the feet , up the back of legs & then bum, crack & sac. Applied more oil & was enjoying very much, she had one hand massaging balls & other under my belly searching for a full rod. 

Began stroking her legs & bum & she asked if I wanted her with no clothes, why not!! Extra 20 on top of HJ.

Small breasts which  react well to touch & kiss & pussy enjoyed being played with (my guess is when younger she had a child as she has some small sagging around belly).

As I stroked her , she stroked me with great action, blew the load , cleaned up & left a happy chappy.

While I was being massaged the place was busy with calls & fellow punters dropping in.

Date of Visit : 24/2/2014

Contact / Address : 3/341 Victoria Ave, Chatswood 9419 5225

Rates : $55 / hour

Age : 35-ish ?

Size/shape : tall, sz 8, 'chunky'

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RnT

WIR? : Yes... for both R and T

Kate is another excellent masseuse here in Linda's thriving business. We have just come to expect nothing else of the ladies here... and as a largely legit operation, any extra is incidental but usually equally good. The place was busy.

I had significant low back pain and had not gone to Chatswood with my usual expectation of punting raunch... I did need treatment. For a superb massage you can't go past Kate. She's no oil painting but she is very friendly with a wide-grin smile and her English is quite acceptable even though she claims great difficulty. I understood her and we did chat. She kneaded all my offending aches with the elbows, hands and fingers of the true professional. 

Towards the end, she performed a most arousing reach-through tt and despite the fact that I wasn't in the state or mood for pleasures of the flesh, I was loud and proud in moments. On the flip, she delivered a superb tug... marvellous... I definitely got more 'relaxation' than I'd set out for. She remained clothed but I doubt Kate would be up for any additional naughtiness.

A $20 tip and I got a friendly, pearly, milfish smile... she escorted me out like a true lady. Kate is here Mon, Wed, Sat, Sun. I can see why she'd be busy

Value for money/recommend? : maybe

My experience/comments : Friday evening, only Kiki on duty, another girl was sourcing dinner next door. Also a Friday is Linda's day off so problems in the communication department were obvious.
I was lucky there was no else there so i was afforded the VIP room (I hate the two tiny ones at the back). I asked for a hard massage and I got it to the fullest. However the massage was mechanical and without any fluency. I found it a bit unusual as massage at Vital is normally good. May not be as good as at 769 but very comparable. I measue the quality of massage (the straight part only) by my ability to relax and to fall asleep. Not in this case, maybe the masage was too strong. There was no tt at all during the process and one leg got much more attention than the other - twice. Maybe she felt some tension there. The customary "turn over ".?!." and followed by my attempts to communicate with Kiki were a loss. But she managed to find whether I was here before to which I replied that I know Linda and a few other girls. This must have given her some confidence and after my left leg got some attantion she skipped the right one and jumped straight to the middle one. Again, as with the massage, it was all mechanical. When I asked for a hot towel she did not understand what I was asking for but eventually she brought one and started wipping me off. I told her that it was a "hot towel" and she found it amusing and kept repeating it a number of times. Overall I have had better sessions at Vital.

Value for money/recommend? :  Yes 

My experience/comments : 

I'd forgotten about this place. Chatswood is a bit out of the way for me but yesterday I had some time and was thinking about the excellent massages I have had in the past from Lily (now left) and boss Linda. As described previously this shop is mostly about the massage. 

Without pre booking I rolled up and Emily emerged from the kitchen area and said 'massagie?' and away we went. I opted for half hour but it was obvious Emily knew what she was doing when she noted the tightness in my neck and shoulders (bit of an occupational hazard I'm afraid) and convinced me to stay for the hour. What followed was an hour of excellent massage that loosened up my shoulders and back. Emily was tut tutting about this bit and that bit being tight. Neck massage hurt a bit and made me glad I opted for medium. I think if you asked for firm from Emily you might actually get it.

Afterwards the usual deal of hot towels to clean up. On turn over relaxation part was also good for the going rate. All very professionally done. So Linda's place hasn't changed still a great place to get a serious massage. Emily works Mondays and is friendly- nice lady and limited english.

Services Provided : massage +HJ ($20)

Value for money/recommend? : mixed feelings but will try again

My experience/comments : 

Used to have decent massages in this place so whilst shopping in Chase I managed to secure one hour for a visit next door.

The place was rather busy and noisy. Nancy was available and I vaguely remember her massaging me a while ago so decided to take one hour. 

As I said the place was busy so we ended up in the tiny room at the back straight down the corridor with en extra internal door that leads to another room that looks like a store. Unfortunately the big room on the RH side was not available and to make it worse was occupied by a noisy Chinese telling something or arguing with the ML. 

I could not understand what was going on but it was annoying. Nancy was apologetic and suggested for me to make a booking next time; fair enough but how one avoid a noisy punter in the room next door?

I did not feel like talking and told Nancy that I want to relax and I would be quiet. She took it too directly and a strong massage I asked for become gradually softer and softer. As the scene was already set I was not going to argue and tried to relax. So average massage was followed by a bit of TT and crack play. 

Time for turn over and a reasonably good HE followed. But again the noise from the VIP room transferred into the waiting room and it was really pissing me off.

From my observation, this shop caters for elderly Chinese men, and they tend to be handicapped in the otic department. Maybe Fridays is their day out after they collect their pension on Thursdays. 

But I will be an old man in not too distant future so maybe I should not be so critical.

Agree Kerim. This shop, owned by well-known Linda, has gone off in recent times. There's usually a lot of 'back room chat' going on which seems to permeate the place. It's become more of a meeting place for Chinese grandmothers, it seems.

For me, Anne was the star here for expert massage but haven't seen her for a while... she was getting over-worked IMO.

Overworked indeed- something I found out first hand a few months back. Can't help but wonder whether a booking mix up was a symptom or a catalyst if she has taken a break.

A quick call to Linda and looks like the shop is busy, but would you expect on a Friday late afternoon. A 1 hr massage session seams to be a problem but eventually Linda suggested Joyce who should be available early in the evening. This suited me fine and allowed to do a bit of shopping before and after the visit. if the massage/HE was to be good I could still get a bottle of descent red at Vintage, if not it may have to be a cheap plonk from Aldi. 

Turned up on time and was greeted by a nice girl with rather eye catching set of tits, unfortunately clad. My mind already raced too far ahead and imagined myself sucking those delectable puppies.

Off we went to the small back room (unfortunately), but as I said the place was busy. Joyce left me to strip down and came back a couple minutes later; inquired about my problems and strength of massage and promptly covered me with a towel. She commenced needing and pushing, pulling and elbowing all via the towel. She worked hard so it was difficult to talk so I kind of fell into my daydream and let her do the job. The massage was competent without being outstanding. Looked like she had some training but not necessarily topped the class. 

She was very pedantic to cover my private parts with the towel and did not venture into those areas at all as it was a minefield. So no TT, no crack play, no pressure points in my bottom  being attended to and any suggestion to take care of them was quietly ignored. 

On the turn over she covered me promptly with the towel and started massaging me chest and stomach whilst standing behind my head. This forced her to band over my head and I could almost feel her puppies being squeezed against my face. Was that an invitation? So I ventured and asked to be told politely NO.

She moved to my side and offered a HJ which I gladly accepted in exchange of a standard fee. I asked again and am told again NO because the boss may sack her. So looked like she was a newbie and was more scared of Linda rather than accommodating a client. Her HJ was too gentle and she asked me how to please a man. Whilst everybody is different and one cannot use this same tool for everybody she needs more experience and education. There are many esteemed colleague punters on this site to give her more training and she may be a good choice for both - massage and HJ. 

And finally trying to free those nice puppies may do her even more good. Maybe after a few visits she could relax a bit more.

My experience/comments:

My lower and upper back needed some treatment and at the same time the little kerim demanded some attention as well so I decided to combine all that with a bit of shopping at Chase. So I decided to check whether Linda could do a bit of magic for me. 

A call to her shop and time is set for a an early evening. All good so far. I have know Linda a bit but she has never offered me more than a professional massage so I was curious whether she could offer me some more this time.

Cutting a long story short there was a professional massage with no TT at all, which was followed by a visit of a younger girl to do the HE. Exactly as had happened to me before. Looks like Linda tries to preserve some legality of the shop and I do understand that. In summary I cannot complain about the massage, as a matter of fact it was good and she worked hard on my upper and lower back.

The HE was also good but not outstanding; I did not catch the name of the girl but she was younger than Linda, maybe about 30s and considering the light was down in the room (BTW the VIP room) I could not see her much and did not see her on my exit but will check with Linda next time who did the HJ for me. If she is good at massaging I may try her out for the full session.

It's an eternity ago but Linda started at shop 19 in Victoria Plaza where she performed a magical HJ. She then moved to North Star before setting up this current operation at 341 (there may have been other intermediate appearances). She's always cheerful when I go... filling out my health fund receipt... but I haven't had a rub from her in years. Anne is the go-to here but as mentioned, absolutely no clothes off... just a superb therapeutic rub with a nice handy to finish

Hard - very interesting, Linda has always done the HJ on me, and like you I'm a longtime customer. Never any more than a HJ but the tease (before "turn over please...), tackle-tickle and tug are all done well.

I'm sure she would if I her booked her specifically and asked but if I go, I habitually book Ann. Having said that, I haven't been for some months... having a bit too much fun elsewhere . I did see Linda in Chatswood Chase the other day... she smiled knowingly

My experience/comments :

This is a short review of my another session at Vital. This time I called and booked Linda for a 1 hr massage session. I reviewed her massage skills before so there is no need to keep repeating them.

But this time I was fully treated to the happy end. And it was a very happy ending. Somehow I suspected that she brings enough femininity, experience and technique to satisfy any client and I was not wrong.

The use of both hands attending to different but important parts of male anatomy was very good; a sensual play with balls and a crack play followed by a sensual cock play gradually increasing in strength and frequency of the rub as she could fill I was getting closer to the happy end. All in all IMHO I have been accepted as a one of the regulars and this resulted in a happy punt.

I have found that if the HE is not good I often need an extra excitement (a sexy touch, a kiss, a nice nipple to suck on, my finger in a wet pussy, etc) to get me over the line; there was no need for it this time as Linda delivered a very sensual HJ.

She told me that she trained a few girls in the shop. I have already checked a few and my experience with this place has been mixed; either a good massage followed by average HJ or the opposite. And I would like both to be good. Linda suggested I should try Ann on my next visit; she has been there for a few years and was trained by Linda. So another review should follow shortly.

I saw Kate yesterday as I was in Chatswood and decided to opt for a one hour massage. She is a 40-ish nice MLC lady.
I enjoy a hard massage and that is exactly what I got.  Be very careful if you ask for a hard massage  as she is all elbows and knees and very hard and is what you will get - no pun intended.
I had not asked for extras or even enquired if they were available but before the flip she went for some slow soft stroking of the glutes, some tackle tickle, and a nice reach through.  She then asked me to turn over, took a quick look at my boner  and motioned if I would like a happy ending.  The tug was nice and she allowed me to reach under her clothes and play with her nice b cups.
55 for the massage 20 for the extras, a great massage and a happy ending, I would see Kate again.  She works Monday, Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday I believe.

My experience/comments :

Anne (Ann) has been reviewed here a few times so I will stick to my personal observations and add a few comments.

I saw Anne a long time ago at this place; must be at least 3 years ago and I could not remember her name at all. I add she did not remember me when I turned up for my appointment. 

I did make a call and after Linda told me who was available I chose Anne. As I said I did not remember her name at all but Linda recommended her to me at my previous visit so I thought I should try Anne. 

So I turned up for my appointment and she was surprised that I wanted her and I was a bit surprised because I recalled her look and but not much else about her. Linda had already left the shop.

It was a cold evening so after disrobing I jumped on the table and covered myself fully with the towel to keep me warm. After a few minutes Anne came and started a strong massage (I asked for it) and this continued for quite a while. The massage was competent bothering with professional but nothing special. There was no tt or any other sensual touching. 

On the turn over she promptly covered me with the towel and continued to serve a professional massage with no special attention one could expect on the turn over.

I talked to her a bit and the good thing is that she could communicate in English reasonably well. She told me she has been with Linda for about 5 years and that it was Linda that thought her how to massage. This explained to me certain technique I remember well from Linda's massage. The end of the massage session came quickly and there was no hint of HE. 

In the end I had to ask for it and she seemed surprised but started the play. Again Linda's technique was visible, a two handed motion, etc brought me to the end. I asked for additional sensual experience but she firmly said no so I had no chance to feel her at all.

In the end a nice comfortable massage with happy ending. I think I gave Anne a wrong message at the beginning by covering myself so tight with the towel. She could have taken it as my protective shield not to be breached.

Overall I classify her massage a bit better or on the par with Lisa from Archer St but Lisa has a much more accommodating approach at the HE stage. This comparison is based on my single visit with Anne.

My experience/comments :

Kate massaged me before a while ago and I did not even remember her but she did and reminded me about me visit in a highly inebriated state.

But back to the recent facts as I do not remember my first visit. I had to go to Randwick one Sunday afternoon so I thought I could pay a visit to Katniss of Randwick but after the exchange of texts she was not available so my mind wandered back to the usually reliable Vital in my neighbourhood. 

So on the way back from Randwick I made a call and booked Kate. I turned up for my appointment and Kate told me she remembered me from my previous visit and gently mentioned that I was rather pissed at the time. It was probably early last year just before my departure overseas for a long period of time when I  had a little liquid celebration with a few mates.

Kate offered a nice hard massage concentrating on twisted and painful areas of my body. There was a mix of hand and elbow work. Towards the end of the back job a nice tt followed by the crack, balls and dick play from the back. On the turnover a nice competent HE was served. I was allowed to play with her tits but had difficulties because she would not let her bra go and I believe she is more like a C cup.  

Nevertheless I managed to play with her tit and sexy nipple and she managed to bring me over the line.

Overall a nice massage/HE and if a favorite massage girl was not be available I would have no problem for Kate to take care of me and the little kerim.

My experience/comments :

This was the first time that I’ve been to this place. It’s next door to Chatswood Chase heading in the direction of Willoughby.

The shop is on the ground floor of what looks to be an apartment building with a podiatrist out the front.

Inside I saw three rooms and there seems to be three staff on at all times, at least when I’ve been there. There’s one good room which is a proper room with a door etc but the other room I’ve been (towards the back) is just closed off with a curtain.

The staff are mostly in the 50ish age bracket as far as I can see.

I saw Cindy who isn’t that attractive I guess but gave a really good massage. Lots of elbows if you are into that but about 15 minutes in she switch to oil. She got on the table and sat on my butt to massage the back and it was pretty good.

Part two was passable, nothing special just an average HJ. I didn’t get the vibe that any extras aside from HJ are available but then again, even if they were I would have passed.

I recommend Cindy but I have been back to see other staff there who I prefer.

Services Provided : massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yeah


My experience/comments :

This time around I saw Monica who's massage I think is excellent. This time I was stuck in the makeshift room at the back. It's not that bad it's just that it's quite noisy with the girls talking to each other and customer coming in and out the main door to the shop.

Monica uses even more elbow than Cindy but I think she is quite skilled. She also uses her forearm to glide up and down the body which feels really great.
Her massage is not only excellent therapeutic wise but is pretty sensual as well. It's hard to describe but she has a really light touch and soft hands which I find arousing. Awesome TT which she does for a relatively long time (compared with other girls).

Part 2 is HJ (pretty sure nothing else available) and I really wish this part was on par with part 1. It's like when she gets to this part all sensuality is lost and she beats the meat pretty aggressively.

Still, I rate Monica as a 'yes I will return'.

My experience/comments :

As mentioned in my previous review I did return. Not much further to add to the last review but I found that this time the massage and TT was a lot better. I mention this because I think it shows that she is receptive to understanding what you like and focusing on that.

This time when she did the HJ she stood a lot closer and let me touch a bit more but still extremely limited in what she would allow. She never told me not to touch anything but it’s easy to know when a women is or isn’t into it. I had to slow her down twice during the HJ this time as she was being a bit aggressive again my dick hurts right now lol.

Overall another good visit and I do recommend even just for the massage which I think is excellent.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 3/341 Victoria Avenue, Chatswood - ph (02) 9419 5225

Hours of Business : 10am to 7pm

Age : around 30

Size/shape : About size 9/10 + awesome rack

Nationality or Ethnicity : MLC

Services Provided : massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

Haven't been to this place for a few months so thought I'd check in. Last time I was there they were setting up a new room and this time it looked complete to me (the room is connected to the waiting area). So I count five rooms in their now, they must get seriously busy in there to have that many rooms.

I really like Joyce she seems like a really sweet girl. Great figure and awesome rack but similar to the review  above, it doesn't seem that she gets her gear off so can't enjoy them that much. Would love to hear if anybody else has had success with this.

Her massage skills are pretty good I'd say, it really depends what you're after. Not a strong massage by any means but not really a soft relaxation style either and no TT at the end.

Part two was pretty good, a little on the soft side but I way prefer that than how some other girls go too hard.

As a side note, after the cleanup she launched into a political discussion asking about my opinion on the upcoming election. So out of left field and thought it was a bit funny.

Overall great experience and I will return.

I used to visit here a lot... Linda, the owner, is an old friend ... bumped into her in The Chase last week. She runs a tight ship and clothes-off with the girls is a nono but topless is available at times. Anne used to be the young star... fabulous massage and perfectly contolled tug but always fully clothed and no touching 

Haven't been for a long time because, as mentioned, the chat among the Chinese clientele and staff is pervasive during a massage... and there's a lot more fun around Chatswood these days . I'm not sure if Anne is still here but Linda has been around Chatswood shops for over 10 years... she was in #19 Victoria Plaza when massage shops were thin on the ground! She used to do a great tug but rarely massages these days.

An upside is the availability of health fund rebate receipts.

I see Linda around and about Chatswood as well, she tends to get good ladies in although leans towards middle-aged side of the scale, young lovelies like Anne are a welcome exception (speaking of exceptions, I did have one who'd doff her gear and we'd indulge in FS but that was a long time ago and she long since moved on).

My experience/comments :

I hadn't been to Vital Massage in some years and it's proximity to Chatswood Chase, following some shopping, was the main attraction. I was greeted by Emily, who has a reasonably attractive face and good English, and shown into a clean room. Emily immediately turned 2 heaters on which soon warmed the room. Finances done, it was gear off and onto the table.

Emily asked what sort of massage I would like, I asked for hard and certainly got it. Actually it was quite a good massage which developed into some intensive glute work (but no TT). Come the flip, I requested and received some chest and shoulder work and was then asked the standard question about a tug. No other services were asked for or offered. Emily then went for the oil and did a fair bit of work on the inside of the thighs and around the tackle before starting work on the shaft. At all stages she kept well back from the possibility of coming within my grasp. Before long, lift off was achieved. I must admit that I prefer the places were nude massage is an option although I am generally too much of a cheapskate to pay for it. Better yet, if it's included in the price.

It was then off to clean up in the excellent bathroom that looks like it has been refurbished recently. It was, however, a little bit public with the window wide open and exposed to the driveway outside and the entrance to Chatswood Chase carpark. There was no pressure to be quick so I had a nice long shower before changing in the now pleasantly warm room. Mission accomplished and out the door.

That's where I think places such as Pink Lady & BRC have it over the others, Jordan. 

Not only is the ML generally nude but fondling is often acceptable. Sometimes a pineapple will also magically convert your massage into a FS session.

Linda's is a very Chinese kind of massage plane - the sort where you get a pretty good massage plus the 'happy ending' tug but nothing else on offer (well, depends on the lady of course, I've had some who were okay to get the pups out and one I ended up going much further with) ... It's this very Chinese "looking after the man" thing where the tug is like part of the massage, it's a relaxing thing and sort of "icing on the cake"... Plenty of places you can get more in the way of reliable extras but one reason I visit Linda's is because I don't always want "more", sometimes I just want a very good relaxing massage and the happy ending.

Date of Visit : 26/09/2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 3/341 Victoria Avenue, Chatswood - ph (02) 9419 5225

Hours of Business : 10am to 7pm

Rates : $35/$45/$65 30 min/45min/60min (new prices) + Tip 

Age : around 40 but in good shape

Size/shape : Tiny, slim, A cups, a real spinner

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : massage, topless HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Good ish, but....

My experience/comments :

Rolled up as usual expecting a chinese milf but a Thai girl comes out- she looks ok, petite with a nice smile so I get over my surprise and go for the half hour. The prices have gone up a fair bit (especially for the hour) so the days of bargain rates appear to have passed for this shop. 

I have been to this shop recently and saw a chinese lady called Emily and was going to review her then realised I reviewed her a couple  of years ago ('you know you have been punting too long when....'). That recent visit I didn't notice the price change as I had just booked the half hour but this time I did.

Anyway Thai girls aren't a strong preference for me but this one was cute. She did a decent job on the massage as you would expect for this place, and she is obviously experienced as a slight rub of her leg and she started light tackle tickle which built momentum over the next few minutes (very nice). On turn over I was at full mast right away and Tammy gives me a cheeky smile and asks if I wanted it taken care of.

I asked about nude and $50 was asked- I counter with $40 and she agrees- then only takes off her top, and even leaves her bra on! After asking she removed her bra, but she did not want to remove her tights. I relented and said $50 but to no avail, for reasons that will remain a mystery the bottom was not coming off at least not today. Now the tug was really nice, Tammy cuddled up and did a bit of light kissing and offered verbal encouragement so no problems there. But her boobs are probably not her best feature so I felt a bit ripped off.

So a pleasant punt, but spoiled a bit because of the business re the semi nude. Either she was ticked off about the size of the tip or it was that time of the month I guess. Either way she was willing to say $50 then not deliver full nude. Big no no in my book. On the way out I saw the other girl on duty, also looked Thai to me so maybe a changing of the guard or possibly a new Boss? Just speculating but didn't see Linda there last time or this time.

Cheers

If you work on the basis that $20 of the $50 is for the HJ, then $30 is for the 'take off'. If only half comes off it should be $35 in total. Anyone ever paid that??

Nope, as a rule I'm used to $20-$30 for the handjob (depending on the girl and the shop) and $50 for the handjob and dropping the togs.

Person's Name : Joyce

Establishment : Vital Massage

Date of Visit : September 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 3/341 Victoria Avenue, Chatswood - ph (02) 9419 5225

Hours of Business : 10am to 7pm

Rates : $65/60 mins + $20 HE

Age : 30+?

Size/shape : Medium size, bit of a tummy, nice boobs once unsheathed

Nationality or Ethnicity : Taiwanese

Services Provided : massage, HJ+

Value for money/recommend? : So-so

Working at Chatswood last week, and despite the many shops there decided to wander down to Vital because I was in the mood for a good massage and happy ending. As I've noted in the past, this is sometimes all that I want.. sometimes I want more raunch and almost anything goes, other times a really good relaxing massage with the happy ending as part of it, sometimes something in-between.

Noticed signage on the front of the top floor of this non-descript red brick block advertising remedial massage, a new business opened up on the top floor spanning two apartments. Looked legit in some ways – acupuncture and TCM also listed, health fund rebate – but as many of us know from past experiences, these Chinese massage places sometimes can and do 'scale' their services to suit the client, eg the TCM place on Archer Street had all the legit stuff but the massage ladies (who did a proper massage) could also go the extra mile or two. So I decided continue past the door to Linda's, up the next flight of stairs and see what this place had to offer.

As it turns out, once through the door it looks more legit than not – a form to fill out prior to consultation/treatment, assorted brochures etc. Last straw was when instead of my hoped-for Asian massage  lady / manager with that certain look, that knowingness in her eyes and that frisson of 'something's afoot here!', a bloke comes out, and in halting English asks if he can help me, so I made up some bullshit enquiry about the health fund rebate, does it cover massage (which he seemed not to even understand, but answer appeared to be 'no, TCM only') and trotted out the door and back down to Linda's.

Standard procedure of 'ring the bell and open the door', out to greet me comes Joyce - but very likely not the Joyce reviewed earlier. English is very average, not much conversation during the rub apart from asking me at least a half-dozen times to let her know if I wanted harder or softer massage. Pretty enough to look at, plus factor is face and eyes, which definitely had that look, minus if it bothers you is that she's got the poor dental hygiene of many Asian ladies, teeth seem small and recessed and yellowed, but that's not really something which is a deal-breaker for me when the overall package is appealing.

I was going to opt for 45 minutes and decide to extend based on her massage skills but up front went for the hour, which is now prices at $65, Linda has posted a note in each room regarding the increase and I have to say it doesn't bother me, she's had the same low prices ever since I started going there perhaps a decade ago!

Should have really done the 45 minutes though, as Joyce's massage skills are almost useless, basically of stroking and gentle pointless kneading, but at least she gets close enough for you to know there's more on offer, positions her legs and boobs to be close enough for you to stroke gently as a sign of your own willingness to move in that direction.

As my legs have been tight from gymwork I decided to flip early so she could work on the front of those and also my chest, no towel in the way and Joyce working away with her oiled hands and leaning over my chest, so you can image it wasn't too long before the obvious moved into the inevitable, although she didn't launch into it right away, which was nice.

Decent HJ skills, I let my own hands roam and eventually worked up to her back, then her sides, then her boobs over the bra, gentle always to measure her reaction, then inside the bra to feel very nicely rounded boobs and attentive nipples. Joyce was okay to slip those out for a little more attention from me, although didn't actually doff the top, while she continued to work on FlyBoy Jnr and reached the expected and somewhat explosive ending.

Time for a cleanup, then more time for massage so she went to work on my feet, where she proved to actually have very good massage skills in the foot department.

Would I return? I'm sure I will, I do keep going back to Linda's every now and again because I know what I'm going to get when I am in the mood for just that, but I'd not spend the money – especially now it's up to $65/hr – on a repeat visit with Joyce, would rather get a proper massage + HJ for my money.

Person's Name : Tammy

Establishment : Vital Massage

Date of Visit : 26/11/2016 (Saturday)

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 3/341 Victoria Avenue, Chatswood - ph (02) 9419 5225

Hours of Business : 10am to 7pm

Rates : $35/$45/$65 30 min/45min/60min

Age : mid thirties - forty I'd say

Size/shape : slim, short

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : massage, HJ ($20)

Value for money/recommend? : Yeah

My experience/comments :

Similar to the review above, I came here expecting a Chinese milf but instead saw three girls in about the 30 - 40 range. I was shown to a room by one girl who's name I didn't catch who left and closed the door. They literally talked for about 10 minutes amongst themselves while I was waiting in the room but I have nfi what they were talking about. Eventually Tammy comes in (who wasn't the one who showed me to the room) and I was happy as she looks pretty good. Being Thai she gave a pretty firm thai style massage with lots of elbow action. I'm not so much into that style but if you are you'll love Tammy. English isn't great and I actually thought she was saying her name was 'Mammy'.

Anyways, I realised the massage was going on for longer than usual and recognised that she was finishing up. Suddenly she says ok finished and I'm like wtf? lol. So I had to ask if she did any extra and she said she didn't think I was interested... yeah right, laying stark naked face up with a massive boner and not interested? ha. Anyway, she does a good HJ but because all the time was used up she had to rush a bit so I think I'll go back and see her again to see what it's like with enough time.

Overall, I think Tammy was good and can would recommend checking her out.

I saw Joyce here a few weeks ago and it was kinda weird. I was in the waiting area as all the girls were busy and she walks out and starts talking to me like we know each other. She looked familiar so I thought I must have seen her before. Turns out she recognised me from ages ago (see June 2016 review above), so solid memory on her. I think her massage skills have gotten a lot better. She doesn't really do a firm 'professional' style massage, definitively more of a relaxation style but sometimes it's exactly what I'm in the mood for and on this day I thought it was one of the best massages I've had in a long time.

One thing that stuck out in my memory from June was that I didn't really rate her HJ. I take that back now as I think she's a lot better now. It was really slow and sensual, 100x better than what I remember. I didn't find her technique 'too soft' like I wrote above as well so maybe that's why this time was much improved.

Anyway, she's also sweet as ever so great to see every once in a while and I recommend people to see her.

Also, she works Fridays and Sundays as far as I'm aware.

It's Funny Flyboy how they react differently with each customer, I saw Joyce yesterday and she didn't seem too fond of me trying to play with her tits. She did though like it when I worked my hand up those loose cotton shorts and seek out her little slit under her silk panties. I rubbed her to a deep and damp conclusion while she rubbed me. Joyce was very happy when I offered her $30, may go back today and sample the top half. Haha

Was in Chatswood again today and seeking a decent massage with happy ending - should have made tracks to Jenny's at Penshurst Street or maybe St Leona, as they tend to be good massages, but opted for Linda's at 3/341 due to convenience (including easy parking at Chatswood Chase next door). Walked through the door and was claimed by Joyce, so the session was pretty much a repeat of my review above, including that I should have cut it short to 45 minutes. Decided to engage the flip and the tug earlier in the session so that I could relax with a head massage and foot massage at the end, probably the best decision of all.

My experience/comments :.

I got a heads up about this place and was in need of some back treatment after a long flight..  I could only find the one review on here and all I knew I was in for was a good massage, anything else would be a bonus..

Called them up, they are right next to Chatswood Chase which is perfect for parking (3 hours free).  Made an appointment for 1:30 and headed to Chatswood..

The door to the place is down the side of the building, the building also has other medical type businesses in there so not dodgy walking in.  Rang the bell and entered the place, was met by Kate who looked in her early 40’s, slim but not attractive, but then it is a legit massage joint..  Quick shower and I’m naked on the bed waiting for her to come in….  The room was clean, very large, heater on full blast to create a nice atmosphere and the bed had an electric blanket underneath giving it a lovely warm feel.

I can hear female clients talking in some of the other rooms so it’s obviously legit and I didn’t have my hopes up..  Kate comes in, lays the towel over me for the obligatory stretch…  She then asks where my pains are today that need work, her English is pretty good but not perfect..  She checked on how hard I wanted the massage and got to work on my back..  You can tell a good masseuse when she finds all your knots and sore bits without any questions..  This is probably one of the better professional massages I’ve had, I walked in hunched over and days later I still feel great..

Massage followed the usual process, she spent a good 30 mins on my back using hands, elbows, knees, feet, oil and towel massage, the whole time she kept the towel across my legs sitting just below my buttocks..  The back massage included long strokes that finished at a squeeze of my butt, not in a sensual way but it still created a stir..  After my back she repositioned the towel over my back and worked my legs but no inclination of any extras and not even a flick of my tackle…  After finishing my legs she removed the towel completely and did long strokes from my feet right up to my neck, she did this for a few mins and it felt fantastic and caused more stirring in the nether regions…

Then I hear her getting more oil, 2 seconds later and she is oiling my arse crack, balls and cock…  Damn that caught me by surprise, I thought I was going to blow straight away, she then made sure she’d rubbed oil into every nook and cranny…  She then asked if I wanted a hand job at $20..  Obviously I said yes..  She continued to play with me while I was face down which is my favourite…  Time to turn over, and she was straight in massaging my balls and shaft, she then asked me if I wanted to cum quick or slow - I have never in my punting life been asked that before.  I asked for slow and she was quite happy to just play, sliding her fingers down and giving my arsehole a rub as well.  I had my arm around her and was gradually sliding my hand under her blouse, she said $10 extra to take my top off, she then revealed a perfect little B cup pair of titties with nipples that were like thimbles, small and firm no baby signs or stretch marks…  She was happy for me to suck on them while she tugged away with 2 hands on cock…   I managed to hold out for 10 mins before cumming more than I think I ever have, I didn’t think it was going to stop..

She cleaned me up with a tissue and then got a hot towel..  We had 5 mins left, she asked where I’d like her to finish on, I asked for a head massage and she gave me a great one..

I gave her the $30 tip. I think I have discovered my perfect massage joint…  Certainly worth the 15 mins drive for me…  The only thing that could make this better would be for Kate to be a stunner, but she is a sweet lady with skillful hands…  I’m going to see her again this weekend it was so good…  She even gave me a business card with her name and days on for me to book…

Chatswood has so many Asian massage places to choose from, but I often end up back at Linda's when i want a decent message and a decent happy ending. The other places, I find, don't have Linda's QC and so you can trade a very average massage for some solid raunch in the 'happy ending + extras' department, and as enjoyable as that raunch is, it's not always what I want.

Monday was a case in point, really stiff around legs and back and figured I'd rather have a proper massage, with of course the proviso this is the Asian-style massage where a happy ending is part of the service to ensure the client is fully relaxed and looked after.

The lady: sorry, can't recall her name but think it was Emily? She only works Mondays, if that's any help. On the slightly taller side for Asian woman, early 40s, average but not unpleasant looks. Not a MILF.

The rub: really great, she's well-trained and went to work to get the kinks out, at times I had to get her to ease up on the pressure. She applied some Chinese medicine balm to my lower back to help it. My practice with a 'new' ML (new to me) is a 45 minute booking and extending to one hour if I like her work. I extended to one hour very quickly. Definitely knows what she's doing!

The tug: Also definitely knows what she's doing. Didn't go for any straight-on play while I was lying on my front, as Linda and many others do, although the odd strokes around the arse and undercarriage gave that teasing hint. Turned over a bit early so she could work on the front of my legs, which of course had the obvious reaction in raising Flyboy Jnr, which also raised the question from her if I'l like handjob? Well of course! She handled this very nicely, long twirling strokes with some ballplay, an expert job. I stroked her back, then her front, then up the top inside, and after she saw I had a gentle touch she was happy to drop the top so I could give her boobs some attention too, which she appreciated as I came in a mighty it's-been-too-long spray. Clean up, and remaining five minutes spent on a head massage (the other head!).

The cost: Nominally $65/60 mins + $20 'happy ending tax' here, any 'extras' beyond that can be quite rare and as always up to the lady, in this case I just handed her $100 and left it at that because it was an excellent session in delivering just what I wanted.

Dropped into Linda's again yesterday for some r&r, or was that r&t..? Seeking same recipe as previous - a good massage and a good tug. Alas, was met and claimed by Joyce, other girl was busy with a customer, at least this time I knew to make it a straight 45 minute booking because of her sub-par massage.

Taking Sparksy's lead from my earlier report, I noted that Joyce seemed fine when massaging my back for my elbow to be nestled into the nook between her legs and she'd move into it a little, and I'd return the movement... so when time came for the inevitable finish, my hands wandered south rather than north, unclipped the stud button of her shorts and nudged the zipper down as she acted surprised and said "So naughty!" with a smile, and gave her a gentle but decent fingering for her mutual pleasure. Didn't change the toll, still $70 – $50 for 45 minutes plus $20 tip – but from now on I'm going to call ahead if I'm thinking of visiting Linda's, or I'll seek out some other shop & lady who's more reliable for both sides of the rub -and tug equation.

I really should follow my own advice and ring ahead!

Was in Chatswood again, on a Monday, so thought I'd drop by to see the ML who I wrote up last month (and whose name escapes me). She must have been busy as I was snared by 'May', a rather rounded very-average-looking 40+ Chinese woman, who insisted I try her. Opted for 45 minutes, which turned out to be a very average massage followed by a very average tug. Not even worth writing this experience up, but to say "Avoid May on Mondays". Think I will give Vital a miss for a while now, as it's not delivering the quality rub+tug sessions which I value.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : massage, HE with tits exposed

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

I had some time to spare so dropped in here as I was parked in Chase. Kate led me into a room and as she was avg in the looks department I opted for just the half hour.
Kate actually gives a really good massage which is quite hard and slow. She actually worked some of the tightness out of my shoulders and freed up my hip which is a long term issue.
After about 20 mins Kate did a very brief tickle of the bum and tackle and then went for a hot towel. She rubbed me down and then had me turn over. We didn't bother with any massage on my front but just went straight into part two Q&A. So $50 for tits out happy ending. Probably a bit much as she did just lif t her top but I reached behind her and did the one handed unclip of her bra to free those puppies properly (thankful that I grew up in the era of the drive-in and still have the one handed unclip down pat!)
The happy ending was ok - nothing special - but I must say Kate has a sensational pair of natural B to small C cup breasts. They sit really nicely on her chest and were a pleasure to both see and feel. 

Overall though a fairly typical RnT experience. I would go back and probably will just to get her topless as they really are great tits! I would even opt for an hour with Kate as her massage was very good.

That's definitely a handy skill, Pauldog – and yes, a nice natural pair of boobs that side are a delight. I'm now having happy recollections of my teenage and early 20s times doing the single-handed unclip to reveal similarly marvellous mammaries on very young ladies at assorted 'parking spots' around Sydney...    There's nothing like the natural swell of B- or C-cups on a teenager!

My experience/comments :.

I was in need of a good massage so thought I'd give Vital massage another crack..  Called them up in the afternoon and asked if I could make an appointment for 7pm so I could miss the Chatswood traffic.  Didn't pick anyone in particular so going for a bit of roulette on the masseuse.

Rocked up at 6:45 as everything was pretty much shut in Chatswood chase and thought I could just sit in the waiting room rather than another trip around Kmart to kill time.

As usual I rang the bell and headed in...  I was met my Emily and told het I'd made an appointment, she showed me to the room and confirmed how long I would be staying.  First impressions were a great smile and a fit body...  The room I was in was on the outside wall with windows onto the walkway and curtains wide open..  I asked Emily if we could shut the curtains, I went off to the bathroom and when I returned she had closed the curtains..

I stripped off and lay on the bed awaiting Emily to return..  She put on some soothing music and asked the standard hard, medium or soft..  Like all great masseuses she didn't ask where I needed massaging just has a feel about and worked it out pretty quickly..  She started with the towel on me for the stretching, towel was then folded back off my back and she applied the oil..  She worked for ages on my neck and shoulder blades, followed by long sweeps down my upper body finishing on my bum...  After mu back she moved the towel up to my back exposing  my lower half...  She worked my butt cheeks and thighs and kept sliding into the crack of my ass, she worked my inner thighs but nothing that could be really classed as tackle tickle..  She wiped me down with a warm towel and I was expecting her to oil up my balls like Kate did but there was nothing..

Time for the flip...  And I arranged my cock in place and she gestured for a HJ although seemingly embarrassed..  I smiled and and nodded and she giggled..  She stood at the foot of the bed and started oiling up my balls, she then moved to the side and started on my stomach and shaft, I had to ask her to move her hand up to engage the head a bit more to give me a little more enticing..  She was leaning over and I cupped her breast and she didn't flinch, she told up and let me play with her boobs though didn't remove her bra or t-shirt and there was no offer of topless or nude...  After a while I came and she cleaned me up..

She said I had 5 mins left and where would I like to finish..  We finished with a head massage which was nice..

Overall I think she is a great masseuse with a lot of experience in Chinese massage, The HJ department was sufficient but not mind blowing and it seemed to me like something she has only recently started doing..  she wore baggy 3/4 sweat pants and a t-shirt that was tucked in, giving me the impression she was lacked down from prying hands.  Her english is not the best but good enough to have a basic conversation which we did after the massage as she told me which parts I needed work on when I return.  I'd see her again for the massage and will tell her I want a HJ and ask her to start it while I'm face down - see how she goes..

I remember the manager from last time  and she was cute...  Anyone know her name as I might have to try and book her next time..  I remember a guy coming in about 10 mins after me asking for a massage, maybe if I'd turned up a bit later I would have got her...

Size/shape : Fairly curvy, plump, largish breasts

Nationality or Ethnicity : Probably Chinese, as she was conversing with the mamas an it what sounded like Chinese.

Services Provided : Prolonged HJ for close to 40 minutes, followed by lackadaisical back massage for 20 minutes

Value for money/recommend? : Yes and no, for the reasons given below.  I would not see her again.

After reading the reviews about this place, I decided to try it out, so on the spur of the moment I drove down  to Chatswood, arriving at 3:250, and parked in Chatswood Chase. A short walk down to the building (at least it's well situated), in through the side entrance, and I found myself in front of the door to Vital Massage, with the sign saying ring the bell and enter.  Upon entering, my immediate impression was that the place was a dump; run-down looking, dirty carpet, old furniture, no decorations.  But the outward appearance is not all that important, what matters is the service.

There were two ladies inside, talking to each other animatedly in what sounded like Chinese. One of them, whom I took to be the mamas an, looked immediately familiar, reminding me of someone I used to see around the place in Canberra from way back.  At first they seemed to ignore me, but then the other lady took me and ushered me into a poky little room at the back which was uncomfortably hot, there being no A/C.  Once in the room and facing her, I was struck by her strong halitosis; in my experience that is a problem with a lot of Asian ladies, no doubt due to the sort of foul-smelling food they eat, but in her case it was particularly pungent.  She asked me how long I wanted to stay and I said "60 minutes"; she looked at me blankly, and asked "You want 90 minutes"? Obviously her English was not the best. Eventually I got it over to her that I wanted the hour; she asked for $65 I handed over a $100 note, and she left the room while I undressed.  When she came back with my change, I was standing naked as per my normal practice; I like to give the lady an eyeful at the very beginning, although whether or not she appreciates it is another story.

 Sasa (I only found out her name toward the end) motioned me to lie down, but to indicated I would like her to massage my penis at the beginning while I stood. Again it was not easy to get the message across, but eventually she understood; her immediate reaction was to whisper "Tips, tips, tips".  I suggested $20; her facial expression signalled disappointment, and she said rather tartly, "OK, but no touch".  The she oiled up my penis and began the handjob.  

At this point I need to explain my ambivalent recommendation.  At first the way she massaged my penis was excellent; she obviously has very good penis massage skills, in particular a circular motion concentrating on my glans which made it sensitive, the almost unbearably intense feeling which I really love.  The problem was that after using that technique for a while, she would stop and revert to a rough jerking that was quite unpleasant, and I would have to tell her to use the circular motion again.  Whenever I reminded her she did switch back to the technique I like, which was very enjoyable, but inevitably she would revert to jerking, and I would have to hassle her again.  This pattern continued throughout the more than 30 minutes she spent massaging my penis.

I think the problem was two-fold, on the one hand sheer laziness on her part, and on the other a conflict of expectations.  I wanted to prolong the penis massage for as long as possible, and I told her that I would really like her to spend the whole hour on my penis, to which she reacted rather unenthusiastically.  She on the other hand obviously wanted to make me ejaculate as quickly as possible, so as to minimise the amount of time spent touching that part of the male body which most women find unappealing.  Eventually I ejaculated at 3:10, meaning that I still had 20 minutes left of the hour.  Sasa asked me lie down on my back, and then wiped me down with a warm towel.  She was giving all the appearances of wanting to end the massage at that point, so I had to remind her that there was still a fair amount of time to go, and I would like her to massage my back.  Again this was a sign of laziness on her part.

I turned over and Sasa began to massage my back.  I asked her to make it soft and sensual, and that is what she, first massaging with her palms, and gradually moving to a fingertip butterfly style.  The trouble was that she was not giving me any tackle tickle; she ran her hands down the outside of my buttocks, avoiding my inside thighs.  Eventually in desperation I took her hand, placed over my anal cleft, and told her to massage in there.  For a while a while she complied, lightly touching my testicles.  However, within a short time she reverted to avoiding my buttocks altogether.  It was a repetition of what had happened during the penis massage; a bone-headed refusal to do what pleased me, instead doing what she found most congenial.

Finally the hour was up.  I got up off the table, went to where my clothes were piled and picked up my shirt so as to get my wallet.  Immediately Sasa was onto me, babbling "tips, tips, tips" over and over.  As soon as I had handed over the $20 note she was out the door in a flash. That really pissed me off, since my experience with many Asian masseuses is that they wait in the room and help you to get dressed, even helping you into your shoes.  This seems to be a form of traditional Asian courtesy.

My overall impression was mixed.  Certainly the prolonged penis massage was very good and satisfying, being one of the longest I have ever had, second only to the 60-minute penis massage I once received from Cat in Canberra.  However, the reason it was so good and prolonged was that I was constantly urging Sasa to use the technique that I liked.  That was very annoying, since I much prefer a masseuse who takes the initiative and does not need to be told what to do all the time, eg someone like Jessie at Northern Remedial Massage at Middle Cove, whom I have reviewed elsewhere.  In summary, I may try Vital again, but I will certainly not be seeing Sasa.  That halitosis, phew!

My experience/comments :.

So it's Valentines Day, I'm sat at home on my own and decided I needed a bit of entertainment and I also needed a massage..  My go to girl Kate doesn't work on a Wednesday so going by the reviews above I decided to try Joyce..  Called up early afternoon and made an appointment for 7pm..  About 2 hours later I missed a called from Vital Massage which I thought was weird, so I called them back..  It was Joyce that had called me, they had a staff dinner planned that night and the last appointment she could do was 6pm..  A bit of a rush after worked but I booked it..

Got there at 6, rang the bell, walked in and was greeted by Joyce..  She confirmed I had called and showed me to the room..  I noticed she had a great little figure and pretty face but her teeth are bad..  I couldn't work out if her front teeth were broken or just decayed, a bit off putting but hey ho with the lights down you can't see it..  I was still getting undressed when Joyce re-entered the room and she carried on her business while I took everything off, climbed on the bed and positioned my cock between my legs for her to play with..

Her massage skill was not the best - more a stroke than a remedial massage, but what was nice was she was wearing these short baggy black shorts and constantly rubber her smooth slim legs against me..  It didn't take long for her to massage my arms to move them to hanging off the side of the bed so she could straddle it and rub her pussy against my elbow..  After she did the a few times I took the opportunity to start stroking and caressing her calfs and back of her knees, she didn't flinch and let me carry on..  From the angle she had me at I couldn't get my hand above her knee - Very clever...

So the massage continued with no real tackle tickle except a slide of her hand down my butt crack and me feeling her legs at every opportunity..  You know the feeling when they have massaged everything and you are wondering what will come next...  Well Joyce proceeded to pull my butt cheeks apart and massage my ass hole with long strokes around my balls and cock, I managed to get myself up onto my knees and she pulled my cock out back, pumped it with 1 hand while rubbing my balls and asshole with the other..  She did this for about 5 minutes, I was in heaven..  This is my favourite as you can feel everything but can't see as your head is stuck into the table, if I can get a massage girl to do this for 30 seconds I'm happy, so 5 mins was bliss..

Turn over time and she oils the old fella up a bit more and starts to work on him, slow and sensual, she was getting so close I thought she was going to blow me but unfortunately she didn't (Maybe next time)..  She massaged my cock for about 10 mins, during this time I'd managed to slip my hand inside her baggy shorts and grab her cute little ass, played with the pussy through her knickers (I'm sure if they had been smaller she would have let me slide under them) and wormed my way under her baggy top to find the most delightful tiny A cup boobs hiding in her very padded bra..  After 10 mins she asked if I minded if she played with my cock more, So I asked if she minded if I played with her pussy more..   hahahaha...  She went and got more oil for my cock and opened her legs more so I could better access to her pussy..

I asked her to take her top off but she said her boss wouldn't allow it and the door doesn't lock..  I remember from late sessions before that the boss goes home early so I'll try and release the little bee stings next time..

Finally after 15 mins of constant attention I spayed everywhere, she cleaned me up and finished me off with a head a face massage..

All up Joyce is a great girl, if she fixed up her teeth she would be very cute..  The massage was below par for a remedial but part 2 certainly made up for it..

I've now seen 3 girls here, this is how I'd rate them:

Emily - Attractive Milf, very professional massage, HJ a bit mechanical and felt like she had to do it rather than she wanted to
Kate - The perfect all rounder..  Good quality remedial massage and wicked HJ, she even got her tits out for me to suck on, just not a looker..
Joyce - Lacks in the massage department (maybe no formal training), but part 2 is one of the best I've had in a long time..

This place also has a very very attractive MILF, well presented and I've seen here there a few times..  I meant to as Joyce who she was but I forgot, she has a manager air about her so no idea if she massages..

My experience/comments :.

So I'd done something to my neck and it was getting worse by the day..  Waited until Monday so I could see Emily as I know she does a fantastic professional massage and I could get a HJ at the same time..  Monday rolls around and I called up Vital, spoke to the lady and asked for a booking with Emily to which she replied "Emily on leave, back in 2 weeks", so I asked for a booking with Kate and was told she was not working today.  I declined the other girls and decided to do some research about where else had good reviews for a professional remedial massage.

After poking around the forum, all the local professional quality masseuses didn't appear to work on Monday's, so I called back Vital..  I explained that I had called earlier to see Emily but she was not working and asked who was working today who could give a professional massage as I has a very sore neck.  She reeled off the name and said which one you want?  Again I said I don't mind who it is but they must be able to do a hard massage as I had a sore neck, she went through the names again and I asked her to pick who she thought could give a firm massage..  She then said maybe I could do the massage if you want hard, my name is Linda, I then remembered my earlier posts about a MILF and someone saying it was probably Linda but she probably doesn't massage anymore..  Sounds like I'd hit the motherlode, and booked with Linda for 18:30...

Rocked up at the place at 18:25 and explained I had a booking with Linda, it was like Chinese whispers with shock "he's got an appointment with Linda", someone scurried off and came back and said Linda will be in shortly and showed me to the room..  I stripped off and assumed position on the bed. Linda enters and sure enough she was a bit of a MILF with a cute face and slim body..  She said "so you have sore neck", I took the opportunity to prop myself up and explain I had pain from the centre of my back up to the base of my skull, I also said I was sore from my butt through my thighs, then I rolled over grabbed my cock and said he needs some attention at the end to, she just gave a cheeky smile and said OK.  She put a towel over me which pretty much stayed on my bottom half for the entire massage..

So Linda started on my back and kept saying, what have you been doing your muscles are so stiff.  She gave one of the best remedial massages I've had for a long time and really loosened me up.  She then moved to my ass and thighs but unfortunately no tackle tickle.  She said we were running low on time so if my legs felt OK we can turn over, she needed to do some work on my chest and stomach..  So she lifted the towel and I rolled over and she covered me again, I was beginning to worry whether we'd have time for a HJ..  She worked my chest which was sore from the gym a few days earlier, then she peeled back the towel grabbed my cock and gave him a rub.  She then removed the towel completely and fetched the oil..  She oiled me up and asked how if I wanted a hard or medium hand job, she looked at my cock the whole time and didn't mind me grabbing a handful of ass, she was wearing jeans but it felt pretty good.  As there was little sensual buildup it took me a while to get going and I eventually blew, she carried on stroking away after I blew until all the drops had come out which felt great.  She cleaned me up and then did some more head massage and finally a lot of stretching for my back..

In total I was in there nearly 90 mins..  We chatted as I got dressed and she said please come an see me again next week or two so we keep you loose, you still need some work doing.

Winner..  I'm on her books for a quality massage, and with her being the mamasan she doesn't have to clock watch..  I did think given her experience the HJ would have been more sensual but I was more after the massage and the HJ was a bonus this time.  One thing I did notice was she has very thick hands, not big but thick.  She held my hand a few times during the massage and when she gave me my change I could see..  Not a bad thing but certainly different..  I'm hoping after a few sessions and I'm a regular she will open up a bit more..

Date of Visit : May 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : (02) 9419 5225

Hours of Business : Daily 10:00 - 19:00.

Rates : $65 / hour Oil Massage, $20 HJ

Age : 30's.

Size/shape : 165cm, Size 8/10, slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Massage, HJ 

Value for money/recommend? : Yes / Maybe

Experience:
Everytime I visit Chatswood I have been meaning to give this shop a try but there are so many choices around and I have been going back to a few favourites regularly too.  This time I decided I will have to try this shop and book Joyce (who appears to be the prettiest out of the ML's working here).

As walked onto the grounds I saw a rather plump lady just finishing emptying her mailbox and she followed me up the side of the building  and hung around long enough to see me press the buzzer for Vital Massage before making her way upstairs. 

First impressions was the foyer reminded me of a Doctor's surgery, with a sitting area with 4 chairs and the Mamasan / Senior ML sitting at a small desk in front of the "patients" :P  Unfortunately, there was another punter waiting his turn so we sat in awkward silence and both studiously looked at our phones LOL

Joyce came out to greet me and she does have an attractive face and nice figure, dressed in a t-shirt and those trackie dax pants made to look like jeans.  Unfortunately all the rooms were occupied (despite my booking) so I had to wait for 15 mins or so until another client left (walking past us all) before I was called in.  Joyce left me to undress, I noted that the table had a fresh new sheet placed on it which was good!  

Joyce commenced a rather light massage (even though I had stipulated medium) and it was more a sensual style rather than therapeutic.  Joyce mentioned she had just come back from a short cruise but she was seasick everyday so didn't enjoy the cruise or the food hahahaha  Joyce did spend a lot of time massaging my upper thighs and butt with the occasional TT thrown in and I lightly touched her legs and butt too.  I was somewhat hampered by a strained wrist and Joyce was on that side of the table :P but I did determine she was wearing a G-string under those body hugging pants. 

On the flip, Joyce went straight into a very good HJ and whilst she had to really work to get little ABC interested (still recovering from the previous day's excursions) she did eventually succeed.

I was offered a shower or a wipe down and chose the wipe down as my hotel was close by. I was pleasantly surprised by the $85 no more to pay cost and walked around the corner past the waiting room where there were 3 punters waiting their turn!

In summary, one of the few places in Chatswood where you can get a HJ for $20. Worth another visit or two to try Joyce again and maybe one or two of the other ladies, although I don't like the position of the waiting room how it faces the front door.

I have been past this place many times and have seen the portable signboard which never seems to be packed away.
The building is more like a block of units converted to commercial uses.  You will understand when you see it.
My back has been quite sore lately so I was primarily after a seriously firm massage and hj as an extra.

Susan is your average mature Asian woman, she is married to an 'old man' her words but won't discuss further.
I paid the fare and removed my clothes and onto the table.
The massage was extremely hard and effective, dont agree for hard unless you are prepared for a clobbering. I would say excellent massage.

When I could take no more of the massage, I was wiped down and the HJ started.
The hj felt really good after the hard massage and I felt very relieved.
Hot towel cleanup, dressed and on my way

My second visit to this place, look out for the portable signboard on the street, it is not the foot placea.
My back has been felling better so I went back for a firm massage and hj as an extra.

Ice is from China and speaks good English. Is sexier than your average mature Asian woman.
I paid my money, removed my clothes and up onto the table face down.
Great massage, she knew exactly what to do, elbow knee, you name it.

She wiped down my back with a hot towel to get all the oil off and asked me to turn over.
Then the teasing started!!!!

She was using every trick in the book to make me blow until she milked the prostate. Need I say more?

I can only say that I highly recommend this one and I will be back for more.

Based on my previous visit, I thought I will try again this Wednesday, not sure if ice was working or not. Experience tells me there is a good chance as many working ladies seem to have specific days when they are available.

I asked for Ice, 'very busy today" was the reply, i was offered another girl but said I can wait.

I can confirm that that is the name she is using. Ice as in frozen water.

Apparently she has been inundated with clients all asking her to use her finger!! I'm surprised there aren't other reviews here.

I gave her $85 like last time, she handed me back a $20 and said 30mins only as she is too busy today. Agreed on Hj and her topless & skip the massage.

She helped me removed my clothes, and she started the tug.I helped Ice remove her top and was playing with those long hard nipples.

I then hopped up onto the table and she continued tugging and rubbing her nipples on me.
Towards the end she milked the prostate and o was spent.

I can only say that I highly recommend this one and I will be back for more.

I was wiped down with a hot towel, she helped me get dressed and I was on my way

Well if she is getting so many visits due entirely to your review here, I'm very disappointed (but not entirely surprised) to see ZERO reviews from fellow punters.

This community is all about sharing, guys, it's give and take not take take take - when you get a good lead from another member here and you decide to take advantage of it, the least you can do is to follow up with your own report. That's how this place works.

Tried to snag a session with Ice today but Linda says she is booked through to 4pm, which doesn't fit with my 'window of opportunity' for client meetings. Linda also mentioned that Ice is now also working on Fridays, so she's obviously very popular and making the most of it. Still no more reviews of Ice here, which either means that most of her clients are not in AXR and simply discovering her in like the old pre-Internet days, and that's not unlikely, but I still suspect a fair amount of her business is coming from this review and the punters are not sharing.

My experience/comments :.

Well I could quite easily have fallen for a massage girl today...  

Called up at 12 to see if they were open and who was working..  The girl who answered the phone spoke perfect clear English unlike anyone I've spoken with there before..  She told me Ice, Susan and Joyce were working, so I made a 1hr appointment with Ice based on previous reports..

Rocked up and walked in, was greeted by a very slim, smiley, bubbly girl  who was so happy to see me..  I asked if she was Ice and she grabbed me by the hands and lead me to the room..  She was over joyed to see me and said she'd missed me and how had I been, told me I looked gorgeous and that I smelt lovely as usual, she then told me to hug her as it had been a while..  Bearing in mind that I have never seen Ice before, I figured she had mistaken me for someone else and someone who she obviously really liked..  So I played along  hehehehehe  Gave her a hug, and she is so slim, gave her ass a squeeze, told her she was beautiful and it was great to see her (again )..

Ice asked if I wanted to pay upfront or later, I opted for later to see what she normally does for the guy she thinks I am..  Ice leaves the room and I undress and take up position on the table..  She returns a few mins later, no dry massage as usual in this place and starts with the oil massage on my neck..  She did her own stuff and managed to find my sore spots that needed work..  She checked on me every now and again to see how I was feeling but otherwise just continued with a professional back massage.

From my back she moved onto my legs, she worked them well and was sliding her hand down the crack of my ass, working right inside my thigh with the very occasional flick of the end of my cock.  At one point she was picking up my foot and placing it on her stomach or boob while she massaged my calf, which was very erotic.  This time when she leaned right in and asked how I was feeling I told her "really horny" she reached in and gave me a squeeze on my balls..

The hot towel arrived and Ice massaged my neck with it then wiped me down, she cleaned my cock and wiped my asshole...  I knew what was coming next...  She then started a dry massage on my cock and balls reaching underneath as she went..  It felt great but didn't last long enough before it was turnover time..

Flipped over and Ice was still beaming at me, she looked stunning, she grabbed my cock and leaned in and started kissing me..  A little reserved, no tongues but lingering kisses on the lips..  I put my hand under her tee-shirt, she stood up and asked if I wanted her to take it off?  I'd said to myself I'd only have a HJ as I always think $50 for topless HJ is over the top..  However she looked stunning stood there smiling and I said yes!!!  She had on a tight little white tee-shirt that she took off revealing a sexy purple bra, I was expecting her to take off the bra but she bend down and took her shoes off, then her leggings, revealing a matching pair os lacy purple knickers.  I'm touching and feeling her skin, she is so soft and smooth and sweaty, it was very erotic.  She unclipped her bra and out popped these perfect natural tities with nipples like I have never seen before, they were like balloons and went straight in my mouth, she seemed to be enjoying it and kept lifting my head to kiss me on the lips the push me back to her breasts..  finally she removed her knickers which I was shocked at, she has a perfect slender figure and a completely shaved snatch, milky white skin and a lovely smile - I was in Heaven!!!!

Ice fetched more oil and greased up my cock and a'hole, she was playing with me and simulating a blowjob which looked good, finger probing my a'hole, my hands were everywhere, in between she was hugging and kissing me..  It all became too much and I shot my load...  Ice continued to pump away telling me how much she likes me...  She cleaned me up, dressed and started a head massage, I love a head massage at the end, but this one was different as she spent the whole time kissing me while massaging my head.

We chatted during the last 5 or so mins of the massage, she told me she is single but hopes one day I'll be her boy friend - hahahahaha.. She kept punching the air saying - 2019 is her year and we'll be together ROFL..  She is a very funny and cute girl, her English is exceptional so you can have a really good laugh.  As a whole massage package she is pretty close to perfect, I felt her HJ was a bit jackhammer at times and not slow and sensual enough (probably because she was concentrating more on kissing me).  I saw Kate the week before Christmas and she gives probably the best hand job out of everyone I have seen at Vital, if she could teach Ice the sensual touch, she would be the complete package..  As I paid, Ice thanked me for taking extras as it would go towards her lunch and study fees.  She works here Wednesday and Friday and somewhere in Epping on other days..

I will certainly see her again for the whole GF Experience, I'll see if I can get her to work on a slower more sensual HJ and the finger up the butt was a bit more amateur and off-putting than erotic.  I love a good professional Prostate massage (I see a lady in Thailand for Karsai and Prostate massage, professionally trained with Universal Tao and worth it if you have never tried, DM me if you are going to Bangkok and need contact details).

My Lineup for this place is now:

Ice - GFE, good massage and fun, stunning figure.
Kate - Fantastic hard massage and the best HJ, cute little tities.
Linda - Great therapeutic massage, always massages to the finish (even if it means you run 20 mins over), HJ is a bonus.
Joyce - Soft relaxing massage great HJ

So depending on the day and what I need, I have a few choices..

Happy New Year and looking forward to reading the 2019 reviews!!!

"Ice, Ice baby.... she rubs so nice, nice, baby"

Another Chatswood meeting last week, so I made sure I booked a session with Ice. She's still very popular!

There's not a huge amount I can add to Yampy's excellent review above, or the previous solid report by Flygtfalcon, so I'll keep this shorter to avoid repeating the same stuff.

I booked Ice for one hour, walked into Vital and who should greet me and try to steer me into her room and her clutches but Joyce, who I've seen a few times before and doesn't do a lot for me. I mentioned my appointment with Ice, she grabs Ice who comes up and welcomes me like I'm a long-lost cousin, "Happy to see you again! So nice you come back to see me!" etc etc despite the fact that I'd never seen her before! This continued in the room and during and after the session so I figure that
1. all we white guys look alike to Ice
2. I have a doppelgänger out there who not only shares my face but my taste in Asian massages
3. Ice does this line on all the customers in the hope that they will tip better!

Anyway, after quite some hugs and even gentle kisses due to my coming back to see her, I handed over $100 and said that was all for her, and then sitting on the massage table I slipped down the straps of her top and started to pay attention to her breasts, which are really something special, absolutely perfect size and shape for her. I convinced Ice that if I was naked she should be too, so she slipped off her top and pants, including her panties, and unclipped the bra to let her breasts spill out. Did I mention how great these are? Just go very gentle with the nipples, she's sensitive but appreciated gentle tonguing.

Ice started on the massage while I made sure my hands appreciated her arse and legs along the way. She slipped pants and top back on when it was time to get the hot towel, but after returning to the room and wiping me down they came off again so we could start Part 2 of the session. We ended up pretty much hands over each other, my lips alternatively on her nipples or her mouth as we kissed a little, but although she was fully naked and mostly shaved down there, no hands allowed except for gentle stroking around the area, no penetration for sure, although I can tell that she'd absolutely go off if she let her guard down or for her boyfriend (if somebody here wants to claim that mantle).

I got the whole Ice treatment, although the date-probe was a little full-on rather than erotic and prostate-therapeutic, but the end result was never in question as I blew a massive geyser which made Ice laugh and comment in appreciation.

Only time at the end for a quick head massage, also a bit strong rather than relaxing, and Ice made me promise I'd come back to see her again. I don't doubt it!!

There's an Ice working at Bella Vista massage who matches your description reasonably well in terms of overall size and demeanor.  She has some fairly distinctive body art.  I'm not sure if there are any conventions in the forums around the discussions of fairly unique physical traits, I'm guessing it's OK, but I'll hold off for now.

(Their site is here and reviewed elsewhere on the forums, although the address on the website is wrong, they're now at 105/33 Lexington Dr, Bella Vista, not too far away.

I don't recall Ice having any 'body art' at all, let alone anything 'fairly distinctive'. But I saw her only once so could be mistaken, maybe others here might have better recall?

(It's also possible this is a new addition to her MILFy body, although in my experience Chinese women of her age and situation don't go into for much 'body art' at this stage of life)

Ah, it seems I didn't spend enough time reading all the descriptions.  Milfy is definitely not how I'd describe Ice from BVM, she's a bit younger, and you definitely wouldn't miss the body art had it been there, and it's extensive enough that it's certainly not new.  I think I first saw her at Bella Vista in March, where I believe she works two days. (Mon / Thu?)

Having clients anywhere is good for my budget, but less so when they are in Chatswood as I am often tempted to relax with a massage.

And I know there are a LOT of 'massage' places I could visit, but I really do like a decent massage plus a happy ending and the option for more, should that take my fancy. A lot of Chatswood places are better at the tug than the rub, so I lean towards shops where there's a decent balance. Linda's tends to be one of those, although the experience can be inconsistent, as can any place for that matter.

I mean, if you want a good massage and utter raunch these days, head over to Help Street and see May at Mali Mali. Many years ago, Natalie at Tiandi was up there for fantastic massage and extras. Ditto Jenny's old shop at 29A, and Jenny herself for that matter. So you CAN have the best of both worlds. Linda's is usually not in that sphere, it depends on the lady but as a rule of thumb at least they can usually do a good rub and a good tug.

So, that brings me to Melody, who works on Monday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. Right away, the fact that she works four days there means shoe knows what goes on, she's not some 'green' less-experienced one day a week woman.

I was a bit struck by Melody's looks, she's a bit 'girl next door' in a simple way but her cast, her facial shape, was simply not 'Chinese' as I have come to know it, nor was she that northern Chinese Mongolian look, but still something different. Turns out she is from Tibet. That explains it. Has been in Australia for maybe a year and a half. A bit chubby around the waist.

Melody's massage is decent without being outstanding. I'd say 8/10, maybe that's a bit generous, Not a lot of muscle manipulation but still very good and relaxing, enough so that I booked for 45 minutes and decided to extend to 60 minutes. That's my usual habit with a 'new' lady, if she's not busy then I book for 45 minutes, can stick with that if she's average or extend during the session to 60 minutes if she's good, and they always like it when you extend as of course it's more money for them.

Anyway, Melody did a decent enough massage, and a few hints of play to follow as she worked around my upper legs and backside. Interesting manoeuvre at one stage, she angled my legs around in an unusual position and really gave them attention from a different angle, which also led to some long strokes along the inner thigh and around the arse. In short, definitely no doubt that extras were there, and when it was time to turn over she gave my backside a cheeky little slap.

So how was the tug? Pretty good, too. She knows what she's doing without going over the top. 8/10, again. She was okay with my hands roaming and agreed for $30 to the tug plus top off, it was obviously a bit of a slow day. Boobs would have been good a decade ago, well maybe, but these days there's serious sag which took the thine off things for me. None the less I showed my enthusiasm for her breasts and nipples to help get me across the line in decent fashion.

Cleanup was followed by a nice head massage, again, Melody does know her massage generally even if she's not a stellar performer.

$60 for the hour plus $30 tip. All up, not the worst way to spend $90, but I can't see that I'd go back just for Melody.

Another visit to Vital last week. These Chatswood clients are both good for my bank balance and bad for my balance LOL

It was a Friday afternoon, and one of the Friday ladies is 'Julie'. Now Julie's a very interesting one, and worth a visit.

She has a slightly 'elfin' face which makes her somewhat cute without being a knockout. I booked in for 45 minutes, my usual tactic with a new lady (new to me), and partway through extended to one hour. No drama there as it was a very quiet day, Julie said that all up they had had four customers, shared between three ladies rostered one plus one being a booking for mamasan and expert masseuse Linda. I also figured that this lack of busyness could open up additional extras.

Julie is from China of course, I think she said Shenzen or Shanghai. Her previous job was in marketing, I think it was with a large retailer. It made me wonder how a woman smart enough to work in marketing ended up in Sydney pulling blokes' cocks. For a while, as Julie did a decent hob of massaging my back (around 7.5 or a generous 8 out of 10 on the Flyboy scale), it did make me reflect on her journey and my role in it. Was I guilty as an 'enabler' of this sort of thing?

Go to the point where, as Julie worked around my legs and then inner tights and arse with long strokes that ended up in a pleasing tease, I was completely 'soft' and non-responsive. It's one thing to have a conscience, another when it gets in the way of one's innocent fun which not only harms nobody but helps them, financially.

So I switched mental gears are reflected on the fact that if Julie could have landed a 'more respectable' job here and earning enough to make ends meet, she would have. But by visiting Vital that afternoon, I was ensuring Julie went home with money earned from at least two customers including 'extras' money which was all hers. I also reflected on the fact that Julie was sorta cute, and that no doubt a few of the lads at the Chinese company would have wondered what her boobs were like and, especially when she was a bit younger and doubly so after they'd had some after-work drinks together, would have liked to have gotten naughty with her, and so here I was being massaged by her and 'living' their dream.

And yes, that all worked as intended, helped by Julie having doubled down on the tickle tackle and then flipped me over and gone to work on my front. The start of the tug was well enough done, and as I explored her body and up around her top she made the offer to 'take off', for which I offered and she agreed upon the standard $50 rate.

Julie did the funny thing of "Shhh, don't tell Linda!" which is a laugh because Linda knows very well what these women get up to, although as I have noted elsewhere on AXR, the Vital 'service' has clearly progressed over the years, a tug used to not only be standard but about all you got as an extra,  some ladies would let your hands roam and pop out a boob, then it went to top off, then naked, and now here we had Julie not only stripping down but offering me a 'bodyslide'. It was more of a body to body massage than a well-oiled 'slip and slide', for some of the best in that you want to visit the legendary Mimi at Burwood, but it was nice all the same. Julie's got some extra padding but then so have I, and she appreciated gentle nipple-sucking and tonguing as she physically and vocally encouraged me across the line.

All up costs were $60 for the hour plus $50 tip. I'd also suggest that 'extra' extras may be available, but as always this is a YMMV thing.

My experience/comments :.

So, I've just been reminded I haven't posted in a while,  which means I need to get my laptop out as Tapatalk is not the best interface for reviews..  

I just had to look back through this post to see when I last visited Emily, it was back in Nov 2017 and my feedback seems to be she was a bit of a novice in handling the manhood department, oh how her skills have been honed over the past 18 months..

I've been wanting to have another crack at Emily for years as I found her massage to be good, however with her restriction to Monday's only or my need for a good tug had ment our paths never aligned.  I do remember trying to see her earlier in the year but she was on holiday..

So as usual I called up and made an appointment to see Emily at 6:30pm..  My recollection in my mind was she was this cute little milf.  I rocked up, rang the bell and walked in, I was greeted by an older lady and I explained I had an appointment with Emily.  She showed me to the room, muttered something and walked off..  I stripped off and as is now my usual tack, I stood around naked waiting for my masseuse.  I was a little thrown when the same older lady walked back in, I then asked if she was Emily?  Now either I've killed too many brain cells with alcohol or I've seen too many RnT masseuses over the years, but this lady looked nothing like the Emily I had imagined in my head - she wasn't bad looking or anything just older, maybe the old Asian young to old change had occurred.

So now it'd been confirmed she was Emily, I explained where I was having issues on my back that I'd like her to work on, also told her I'd like her to play with my cock at the end.  She was happy with my instructions and asked me to get on the bed.

The massage as was my first experience was a great massage, working on the bits that I needed in the right way.  A good rub is the perfect combination for me..  So the massage proceeded as expected but the tackle tickle was much more pronounced, not over the top but enough to get the blood flowing in the right areas.  Wipe down with the hot towels and she had a bit of a dry stroke of the jewels before the flip.

On the flip she immediately oiled up her hands and started massaging my balls and she knew what she was doing.  She'd moved to the side of me so i could get a good handful of her boobs (clothed) and they felt lovely and soft, she leant forward and started licking my nipples, I'm not a fan of this but it was quite sensual.  next out of nowhere she thrust her tongue down my throat and was full on pashing me while giving me an amazing slow stroke.  This just took me over the edge and I blew all over her hand and arm..  So Emily has learnt to handle cock and is not shy about it anymore...

She cleaned me up and started on a head massage.  She then quite abruptly asked how I know to book her (Her English is way better than it appeared to be on my first review).  I explained I'd seen her a few years ago and have wanted to see her since but can't normally make Monday's.  She explained that she now works Monday'a and Wednesday's, which  is bonus for me.

Massage finished and I gave her $100, she said thank you and that was it..  It was a weird awkward situation, I was expecting change and she didn't seem to notice, this has happened at a few places lately.  I eventually said, do you have some change for me, it was as though the light went on and she said Oh, OK I'll go and get you change..

All up, a nice massage and a passionate kiss with HJ was good.  Next time I want to see if I can get her top off, it wasn't offered but her boobs felt great through her top.  

Has anyone seen Emily and had her take her top off?

Had been wondering about this place for a while.....

Wandered in at about noon. When facing the building you go down the left hand side and enter midway, first door on your left, ground floor.

Push the door and walk in.

An old building, but quite clean inside.

Met Kate, who said it was quiet and I was first customer of the day.

I asked for one hour massage and gestured with closed fist wanking motion and got a smile and a nod.

A most excellent massage, much needed after 5 weeks in Greece for holidays......no punting fun over there....

At the 30 minute mark the TT stared while face down for about five minutes and it was done by someone who really knew what she was doing.....

Flip time and she asked if I want her to take off her clothes. Answer was no, just a wank please.....which was sublime frankly.....asked if she would finger fuck me and reply was yes for a tip, which I offered $10 on top of the $20 already agreed at the start.....if was really well executed.

I would definitely return as sometimes having the older women is nice because they really know what they are doing and there is no offer the top money requested. It's like its a market price! She works Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

When I was leaving I noticed two other women in the kitchen who said hi....they were mature, but quite attractive, in a MILF kind of way..

My experience/comments :.

I needed a massage and decided in my head that Kate's part 2 was better better than Emily's.  I held out all week and called Vital on Thursday; How disappointed was I when they told me Kate no longer works on a Thursday, What I was more pissed off at was I could have seen Emily the day before instead of having to holdout for another day to empty the bags.

So called up Friday and made an appointment.  Arrived on time and Kate was waiting for me.  This girl always amazes me, I might not see her for 3, 6 or 12 months and she remembers who I am, when I last visited and tells me off for not visiting her more often.

I was shown into a room right at the end of a corridor that I have never been in before, it was a tiny room barely big enough for the bed and seemed to have the store cupboard at the back as people knocked for towels.  I was surprised I was put in here as they seemed quiet as I saw Joyce and Linda sitting in the room off the waiting area.

I stripped and waited for Kate to return so I could show the areas I needed work on.  I pointed out a couple of places on my neck and centre of my back, I finally asked Kate to work her magic on my cock and proceeded to lie down.  After Kate placed the towel on me it became apparent why I was in such a small room, Kate climbed up on the bed, lent her back against the walls and gave me a shiatsu massage with her feet.  The massage was strong and deep but very well executed for about 30 mins.

After Kate had stamped out my knots, she started long strokes with the oil, this eventually worked it's way to my ass then massaging my balls and cock..  This is the reason I book Kate as she does a great reach around, or should I say she normally does;  This time it was a bit light on touch and not as great as other times I've been.  Before I knew it she was asking me to turn over, where normally I'm saying to her I need to turn over before you make me cum all over the bed.

On the flip she continued massaging my balls and I touched her side under her tshirt.  Kate asked if I wanted her to take it off but also insinuated that she could take everything off, I asked how much for just the top and she countered with what is it worth?  So I said last time you said $30 for HJ with your boobs out.  She said OK and took her top and bra completely off, whenever I've seen Kate before she has just pulled her top up so I was shocked she took it off.  She has perfect little B cups with no sign of ageing or drooping, She didn't offer me them to suck on but was happy with me playing with her responsive nipples while she pulled away at me.

Playing with her nipples meant it didn't take long for me to blow.  Cleanup, hot towel and a great head massage to finish.

It got me wondering, what would Kate be like naked, would she really get naked or was that lost in translation?  I didn't go for nude as she has only ever pulled her top up with me before.  Has anyone else seen her or anyone else here naked?  I've only seen Ice naked here and assumed she'd gone because she got naked..  Maybe next time I try....

Ice had such a perfect body, didn't she? I don't think she was dumped for going naked as many others at Vital nowadays do this and FS too, I suspect that Ice either 'retired' having earned enough to reach her short-term goals, or moved to a shop which was closer to her suburb and/or had more days available on the roster for her, so she could boost her earnings potential.

My experience/comments :
I had never been to this place before but found myself at the hell hole of a Medicare office in Chatswood just around the corner. After a quick scan of the forum decided to check it out.
Rang the bell and walked in and was greeted by Cee Cee, very warm and friendly. Showed me into a back room, clean enough and an easy vibe about the place. I opted for a 30 min massage as I hadn't been here before.  I paid $35 and Cee Cee gave me a smile and a nice hug and left the room. I stripped and lay face down.  She came back in and proceeded to give me a really good massage, I found it firm but also relaxing. No tackle tickle but then a little whisper in the ear "you want to do handjob today?". Yes indeed, 20 for HJ and she asked if I wanted topless... I said I want her fully nude and that was $50. So off with the gear and a really nice touch she has. Very nice handy with a bit of light kissing of my face and chest. Sow and sensual touching.  When the time was up I extended to the hour as I was really enjoying it.  I got her up on the table sitting straddling the table opposite each other while she stroked me and I massaged her pussy.  Then she wanted me to cum, so I laid back down and blew a load in her hands.  She cleaned me up and gave me more massage.  About 5 mins from the end of time I asked her for another HJ to which she was very surprised... said she didn't think I could cum again.  I disproved that theory and left a happy man.  Cee Cee works Wednesdays and I think I'll return.

Age : early 40's
Size/shape : a little bit Milfy, great body, not the best face but certainly not bad.

On the flip she continued massaging my balls and I touched her side under her tshirt.  Kate asked if I wanted her to take it off but also insinuated that she could take everything off, I asked how much for just the top and she countered with what is it worth?  So I said last time you said $30 for HJ with your boobs out.  She said OK and took her top and bra completely off, whenever I've seen Kate before she has just pulled her top up so I was shocked she took it off.  She has perfect little B cups with no sign of ageing or drooping, She didn't offer me them to suck on but was happy with me playing with her responsive nipples while she pulled away at me.
Playing with her nipples meant it didn't take long for me to blow.  Cleanup, hot towel and a great head massage to finish.
It got me wondering, what would Kate be like naked, would she really get naked or was that lost in translation?  I didn't go for nude as she has only ever pulled her top up with me before.  Has anyone else seen her or anyone else here naked?  I've only seen Ice naked here and assumed she'd gone because she got naked..  Maybe next time I try...

Yes, Kate does the full strip. I visited her a few weeks ago. As you say, a bit MILFy although not the best face and certainly needs dental work. Body is decent for her age. $50 got her naked and doing a bodyslide plus some undercarriage play, that's her undercarriage not mine. But I wouldn't rush back to repeat the whole experience.

Monday December 30 saw me finishing up some client work at Chatswood so I figured I should have a lady finish me as well, think of it as a happy ending ahead of the happy new year.

I opted for Vital, which has long been a go-to in the area for a generally decent massage and tug, a balance of the rub and the rug at a fair price.

Wandered in to be greeted by Melody, and I thought "Okay, that's a stroke of luck" as she's decent-enough on the eye, nice company, gives a very good massage and a very good tug. Melody escorted me into the largest room, off to the left, and I opted to stay for one hour. She walked out, I stripped down and hopped onto the table, door opens and closes, and a different woman leans down near my face and says "Hello, my name Emily, you ready for massage?". She's got an easy on the eye face, nice English and a nice smile, appealing enough but she's not Melody. Anyway, then I head Melody call out something from the living room area and this one gets up, apologies and leaves the room.

Fair enough, maybe just a muddle. The shop does seem a bit busy and I get the feeling that Melody is sort of 'acting Linda' today. Anyway, a minute or two later, door opens and another lady leans down, "Hello, my name Emma"!

I introduce myself but point out that my massage is with Melody, she calls out to Melody in Chinese, Melody replies, then 'Emma' says "Wait minute please" and leaves.

Finally Melody herself comes back in, it's been a bit like musical chairs, but she settled down to begin the massage. Until maybe a few minutes later another customer comes in, and I can hear that he's not happy, he asks after Melody, so she scampers out and the exchange basically goes that he maintains he booked ahead and booked Melody, he doesn't want to see any of the other ladies, and he says "I'll come back in an hour." Then Melody re-appears in my room, apologetic, says there was a mix-up with the booking. Maybe she thought I was the customer who booked? I honestly can't care too much, I'm a bit 'over it' but just let it go, as I also know that keeping your cool is better in these situations with Asians, so I take her hand and day "That's fine, just send me Emily, the first one who came in." Melody is grateful, goes out, I can hear a quick exchange with Emily hopefully along the lines of "He's a regular and a very nice man and a friend of Linda, please take good care of him".

Emily comes in and I have more of a chance to appraise her. A nice face and shape, basically MILF next door, a really nice smile and manner. Right at the start, gives me little kisses of thanks and affection on the neck and cheek as we chat. 

Emily does a good massage, if you want hard then be prepared for it, I opt for medium-soft and the 'medium' bits are still very strong, she knows what she's doing. No fancy moves in the massage, such as splaying out your legs to work inner thigh, but all good. Oddly no tickle-tackle while I'm lying on my stomach, just the barest hint of a touch of the sack while working inner thighs, as if this was almost-accidental in a legit massage.

I turn over, Emily oils up her hands and begins to work on my abdomen. Oddly, she hasn't ducked out to get a warm wet towel before the flip so as to wipe me down, which is SOP here and also is a clear demarcation between the rub and the tug, but that doesn't bother me. Emily's attentions as she massages my abdomen and upper groin and inner thighs has the obvious effect, and she switches to the tug. She also does this part very well, good attention to the stalk and balls. Also, so far no asking if I want this or how much I will pay, which is again common SOP here, she just seems to treat this as part of the session although I know it'll cost extra.

Then she leans forward and sticks her tongue in my mouth. This doesn't sound very sensual because it's not done very sensually, no gentle kisses or pecks or sliding the tip around my lips and gently inside, she basically plants her mouth over mine and fully inserts the tongue, not even a lot of movement of the tongue either, just a bit back and forth. I respond with my tongue but more gently, guiding her by example as to what's better, and she seems to get the hang of it a bit.

Emily has a nice build, so I slide my hand up over her top and gently caress her breasts and rub around the nipples, which she likes. She straightens up and lifts the top and bra, but I suggest she take it off, to which she smiles and nods in agreement, although first she leans a chair up against the door to her room, just like they used to do in the old movies. As I've mentioned before, the ladies at Linda's shop have over the years progressed from the straight rub+tug to a fuller menu of extras, including FS for some. So Emily strips down and she's in decent condition, enjoys having her nipples tongued and sucked, my hand wanders around her nether regions but she's not keen on entry, indicates she's just finished her period but hints that 'next time' things could go further.

In the end I reach that happy ending, delivering a fireworks-like load to Emily's approval. She dresses, heads out for a wet towel, cleans me up and finishes with a head massage. I dress and, unsure of the price for 'extras' as nothing was mentioned, simply proffer her $100, which would amount to $65 for the massage and $45 for the extras. I'm prepared to pony up a little more if there's any sign of this not being sufficient but Emily is fine with the $100 and says she's looking forward to seeing me again, reminds me that she works Monday and Wednesday.

In short, recommended for a decent combo of rub and tug, but of course YMMV when it comes to extras.

Very quick review. Back in Chatswood again, and as luck would have it, I had time to pop into Vital Massage and accost Melody. She's been reviewed here a few times before and is recommended for a good rub and a good tug.

Easy on the eye, with a quite appealing face and good English, medium build with a bit of sag. Definitely has massage skills and does has a great move while you're still on your stomach, where she angles one leg out at 45 degrees and really works around it as well as up around the thigh and crack and sack, then repeats with the other leg, and before turning you over she really makes sure your balls and shaft have been attended to.

Melody will strip down for $50 and offer plenty of access, although her boobs have a lot of sag. The best part of her hand job though would be that while she's gently stroking you and jacking you off, she'll look at you and smile gently and sexily right into your eyes, it's quite a turn on.

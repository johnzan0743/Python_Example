Value for money/recommend? :  Not the best value for RnT, but massage was great.

My experience/comments : Just a quick review to get this place out there, but I didn't 'follow through' with this punt.

Driven past here countless times, thought I'd check it out.
Side entry to nice reception area, was greeted by this pretty, young lady, and led to room - paid $40 for 30 mins.
Massage was perfect, just what I needed. She never asked soft/hard etc. though. All good.

After 15 mins or so, she asked if I wanted extra for $50. I only had an extra $20 on me, so I declined, but was really happy with the rub, so no worries. She asked my name and said to come back sometime. She works there weekends only. She finished the massage and warm towell off, offered a cold glass of water, and I was out with no rush.

Very nice and chatty, great English, and excellent rub. I'll be back.


Cheers,
AS

A few years ago this place was outed in the paper for its "extra's" had been here a few times in my rookie years for the massage & its a very professional massage, some girls offered the extra's & some did not, they use to tell you at reception that dont ask for anything more, the lady will advise during session if she does anything more. Fair enough, sort of 50/50 as to the extra ladies back then, generally the younger hotter ones where all for it. 

I do also recall it closed for a while & was reopened with new owners ect.....might have to check it out i have a sore back

Rates : $65 per hour massage, $40 for extras

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : I had seen this place advertised regularly in the CM and was in the area so decided to check it out, hoping that I could find an ML with genuine skills to ease tight shoulders, but happy to consider additional service that may be on offer. I phoned ahead and set an appointment 20 minutes out. The shop is on a very busy road, however there is limited rear parking and I managed to get a spot.
The receptionist was courteous, professional, young and reasonably pretty. She soon had my massage fee and ushered me into a room to undress and lie on the table. The room was clean, with little more than the basics, a proper table with face-hole ... to the casual observer, a legit operation.

My ML soon appeared and was young, slim, long hair and glasses. When she later said she was a student it didn't surprise ... she looked like one. Younger guys may have found her more appealing however I prefer the older ladies in for both massage and other skills. The massage was OK, not firm enough to release knots, but a good relaxing style. She was veeerry quiet and I sensed, nervous - so I attempted chit-chat to settle her ... When I mentioned places and attractions near her home town she loosened up and became quite talkative and that translated to her massage technique. 

On the flip she enquired hesitantly about extras and we agreed on $40 for a handy. She proved adept at getting things moving with a lot of oil and smooth, sensuous hands that encompassed and squeezed rythmicaly in the right places. She was dressed in hot pants style bib and brace with a modest shirt beneath and she was happy with touching her upper legs and bum cheeks. A thorough clean-up, short head massage and off I went ... 

She was a lovely girl, provided a fair service and would be attractive to the younger guns out there....

We have a thread for a business at the same address as this but different suburbs. Apsley/Kedron. If anyone can confirm they are the same place I will merge the threads.

NL you're correct - they are the same place .... 1355 Gympie Rd, side entrance and it's definitely in Aspley not Kedron. There is a faded sign on the front edge of the shopfront awning 'Golden Class Massage', which you won't see if approaching by foot on the same side of the street....

My experience/comments : 

I believe this is the sister store to 10B/147 Beaudesert Road, Moorooka. As mentioned above, this place is a little bit hard to find if you're unfamiliar with the area. I headed down Moorvale lane and the place is well sign posted so I confidently walked in and was greeted by a 40ish masseuse. I told her I wanted a 1/2 hr massage, she replied that it would be $60 which even for Brisbane is a pretty steep price for a 1/2hr. Anyways, I paid up and was led into a room where I wasn't given much instruction on what to do. She left me inside so I stripped down and lied down on the massage table. The room itself is not too bad with a small mirror, massage oil and the ubiquitous tissues and wipes. A small room heater was turned out made the room a little bit warmer. There's a small lock in the room so all the signs were looking good.

Onto the massage, when she walked in she didn't ask what type of massage I wanted i.e. hard, medium or soft. She worked on my back and worked a fairly light massage that was to be frank rather odd. I'm used to hard massages and her massage didn't do much for at all. She did this weird almost slapping on my back and ass that didn't do much for me. She worked her way down to the legs and spread one leg to get easier access to my groin area. This riled me and then she spread the other leg equally apart and was working the legs rather well. Then a couple of light touches around the ass and she said it was time to turn over. On turn over, she automatically proceeded to a HJ with no mention of any money. Her HJ technique is alright and some words of encouragement saw me over the line. She cleaned me quite well with the wipes and tissues. 

So for $60 for a fairly ordinary massage and HJ this place is alright.

My experience/comments : So i was once again in the area and thought id give it another shot. came in and rang the bell and tina came out of the room and greeted me. not much of  looker i was gonna walk it but was feeling horny and desperate i thought i stay.  so i paid over the 60 bux got nude and lied on the massage table. massage as expected was nothing to rave about, i dont think ive ever had a nice massage from any girls that work here. some of them make up for it in the extras department. anyway so wasnt long until she started rubbing my ballsack and cock while trying to get me hard and even started jerking me off face down while my ass was in the air. this lasted for a while then she told me to turn over and then lubed me up and started pulling away.  she even started moaning and gave me lots of eye contact which i didnt need since she wasn't much of a looker neways. eventually she got me past the line and i got dressed and got the fuck out of there. probably wont be in a rush to come back here unless theres a new girl working. too bad my favorite doesnt work there anymore.  i use to frequently see her and had amazing times.

 Ah, Moorooka Health & Beauty! It’s been ages since I was a regular at this establishment. Back in the days of hottie Kandy and her lovely hands and various delicacies. I was feeling some horny nostalgia so I decided to visit and I was not disappointed. The Moorooka neighbourhood looks a lot nicer these days but the little arcade and the parlour itself hasn’t changed a bit. The rooms still have cctv monitors although the screen’s are so worn out. Shower’s still there and it still works like before so no improvement there. I rocked up around noon and Amy was the only one on. I was also the first one of the day. Amy is from Taiwan and was pleasant looking MILF. Not quite Kandy or even the ladies of Hicks St. but I still found her pleasing to the eye. She was very friendly and welcoming with just a hint of cheekiness which boded well for the session. I paid for 30 minutes and Amy gave me a firm, Chinese-style massage which almost reminded me of Kandy’s technique. Here’s another ML I wouldn’t mind spending an hour with. Anyway, we both knew what I was also there for so the tease soon followed. My hunch was right and her cheek translated to some tasty TT which got the blood pumping. Some polite negotiation got her nude and I also got to eat her out(Yum). Amy was enjoying herself but was unconvincingly a “no” on the subject of FS so who knows? We finished the session in a 69 position with me DATY and her giving HE. I was surprised at the quality of the visit as I thought this place had gone dead. Looks like I’ll have to swing by this place more often again.

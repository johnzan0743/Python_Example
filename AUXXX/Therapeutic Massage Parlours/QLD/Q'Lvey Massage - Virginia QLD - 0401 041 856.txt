My experience/comments :

Saw this place driving past and figured why not. After some difficulty with language barriers, I'd arranged to walk in and see Jeanie for an hour. The massage itself was quite pleasant. The room though was old and didnt feel the freshest. There was quite a bit of back ground noise as well which did hinder the relaxation. She came and  went a few times but was always apologetic and got straight into the massage when she came back.

There's plenty of signs saying no sexual services, so it was obvious they offered something. She motioned to massage my groin and i'd say sure. She also offered to talk off her clothes for extra. I wasnt planning on that so hadn't brought extra cash for that. I also hit her up about a BJ and she said she might be open to it next time if brought in my own condom. So who knows where the services will end.  Will go back with more cash and perhaps some jimmies to see what else I can get.

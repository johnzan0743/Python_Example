My experience/comments :  Finally got around to posting a review of this place and I'm afraid it was a dud punt. It was early Saturday evening and I was up for a good rnt. My original plan was to head for Cloud Nine in the Gabba based on the
good reviews here. As I was walking around the Valley looking for a bus to catch I passed by Bodycare and curiosity got the better of me and went inside. The shop is located in the centre of the Valley off Wickham and you have to go up a flight of stairs to get to it. From the decor and atmosphere, I was getting the rnt vibe with low mood lighting of the premises and was greeted by Avi at the reception. The actual massage room had a shower and fairly spacious massage table and I also noticed the box of tissues so things were looking upÂ….Alas, my hunch was off this time around and it was just a legit massage with no teasing hints and Avi pretty much kept her distance during the session. Now, I would've been ok to just get a massage as I needed it but the massage itself was crap. There was some pressure but lack the technique to back it up. All in all, no rnt and not even a good massage which is a shame as I dug the location and facilities. The moral of the story is I should just gone straight to Cloud Nine as i originally planned. Anyone else wanna try their luck and add a second opinion.

Went in for a legit massage (honest). After her hands went wondering 20mins into the session, went for a $40 HJ. Was by the far the best HJ I've ever had, resulting in a pretty amazing orgasm. Great massage too. Not the best looker, but not complaining! This place also has showers if you want to remove the evidence!

Have been back since with a different lady, and despite rather wondering hands again was told that a HJ was not on offer. That's Brisbane for ya!

Value for money/recommend? :Good but a bit pricey

My experience/comments : I was visiting Brisbane staying in Fortitude Valley after the visiting the gym i thought i would find a massage place and see if i can get lucky. Saw this place and thought it uptairs and a little seedy so i went up and before i got to the top i was greeted by an attractive young lady wearing a full length dress but still showing off her curvy body. I was shown to the room and told to undress lay down in the nude and waited for Linda she returned and covered me up and comenced a good thai massage i did feel her up when she was at the top of the table with no objection, she asked me if i had been there before even though i just finished telling her i was on holidays from Melb. On the flip she offered HJ for $50 i asked for nude but she said she had her period no bargaining would get her to lower the price but she was ok with touching. Hj was nice with a good build up and i got to touch under the dress and around her pussy which had a pad covering it , her boobs were nice and firm but she had tape over her nipples in the end exploded over her hands and she cleaned me up.

No. 

Use to be on the Sunny Coast til it was shut down (I think not seen it advertised for a while after the raid).
Pretty much out of luck up here, plenty of privates but nothing along the line of the cheaper Asian Massage Shops dotted around this beautiful City.

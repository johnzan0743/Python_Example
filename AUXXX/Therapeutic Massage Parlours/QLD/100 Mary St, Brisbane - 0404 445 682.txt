Has anyone been to 70 Berry St lately?
I've not been there myself and read mixed reviews but none recent. Are they still there and what's the quality and VFM like?
I'm just looking for a place handy to the city to get a little handy.
Thanks.

I go there on/off regularly and quality varies on who's working. Different girls coming down from Syd and working for the week or so. If you have a regular girl here, best to check if she's available first.

Me too. The owner is pretty much always there but if someone else is available you'll probably get someone else. Tonight she was busy. Last week there was this girl with fake boobs, great body, shaven pussy. Good sensual massage (not hard at all) and decent HJ at the end. No DATY but she was fully nude the whole time. Touching was ok. Name? Didn't ask because she was there only for that week.

Damage $65 half an hour as always.

It's Spring Hill 4000 although one of the CM ads says CBD.  They've had at least 3 different numbers in CM. I can't find the third one now but these work: 0404 445 682 and 0410 490 971

I went there a couple of days ago. Busy the first time so had to go back later in the afternoon. I didn't get the lady's name and she didn't seem to know to many English words but certainly enough to get the message across.

I was taken in to one of the rooms, asked how long I wanted ($65 for half an hour) and if I'd been before. She led me to the shower, gave me a few minutes to wash and dry and find my way back to the room (thankfully avoiding any other punters). She came back in asked me to lie down and stripped down to her knickers. The was pretty much no massage to speak of, no body slide, just straight to tackle teasing which she was very good at (and this was before she asked me to roll over). I do like more of a massage and lead up especially with body slides but there was none of this to be had.
She had a nice little figure with maybe C-cup boobs and they were a bit too firm to be real with tiny pointy nipples which I wasn't allowed to suck so instead she started sucking on one of mine for a short time while continuing with her excellent hand technique.
She seemed quite distant and slightly mechanical so I didn't really get into it but her hand technique was so good and even better when she rolled me over that she no troubles getting me over the line in just under the half hour despite her fake moans.

So that was it, in and out of the place within about 35minutes (including before & after showers). Overall not bad value for money but I did leave feeling a bit disappointed and am not sure if I'll go back. One nice thing though is it's a walk in service now with no need to book, so quite handy if you find yourself with a bit of time to spare one afternoon.

Person's Name : You dont choose the girl, whoever meets you at the door, will be giving you the massage. They dont offer their name.

Establishment : Thai Tantra Massage

Address : 100 Mary Street Bribane

Hours of Business : 10am till late

Rates : $65 for half hour and $100 for one hour. If their busy, you dont get an hour even if you want it.

Age : Varies between 19 and 26

Size/shape : All kinds. I suspect you'll never get the same girl twice.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai and chineese mostly.

Services Provided : Massage with happy ending. Simple business strategy.


My experience/comments : 

They offer a massage with happy ending. If you want more, you're in the wrong place.

Girls are are typically 20 to 25 years of asian decent. Some massage nude. Most topless. But some keep bra and panties on.

Some girls are scorching hot. Others are a bit chubby. And you cant choose! Its a lucky draw.

Most girls seem to have experience with theraputic massage, and if you pay for an hour, you will usually get a really good massage........with a happy ending.

One girl, did some titty sliding all of my body. But the rest of ladies have merely used their hands.

There arent too many rooms, so a couple of times I have been turned away. 

If you want a shower, ask as you arrive, some rooms have showers and other do not.

100 Mary St, is my regular. At my last visit I got a BJ. 

She offered, said I looked like her boyfriend?! Her only concession was that she finish early and that I not tell her boss. So no extra cost. One hour for $100.

She explained she was just up from Sydney for three days. I guess there is always an element of luck with our massages. Good luck gentleman.

Hey!  I went there today and she told ME that I looked like her boyfriend!  We must look alike Lord Hardwood.

This place is definitely a good choice for someone wanting a sure-thing, walk-in-off-the-street R&T option.  Unlike most places, the Tug is included in the price.  No mucking around, they get straight down with fiddling the bits almost straight away.

I was talked into a 2 girl massage for 30 mins for $120 instead of the 1 hour 1 girl effort I thought I wanted.  What the heck, I always wondered what it would be like.

I can't say it was great value, but I got my twanger massaged and both were down to their undies straight away, and topless on request, with boobplay allowed.  However, the second girl pretty much was the "boobs" of the operation whilst the first girl operated the tug.  Whilst the first girl did her work on my member's end, the second girl draped herself across me and whispered sweet upgrades into my ear.  CBJ for $50, but quickly offered $40.

The other problem was both girls nattered to each other and giggled in their language for a large amount of time.  Not exactly great for the atmosphere.

I have the feeling plenty would be on offer here - I was asked out to coffee for $10 - so get creative lads.  The service was exactly what I wanted, but I would recommend only one girl.  The chatting got to me and the duo team didn't really give me anything other than a pair of boobs to hold whilst being tugged, and pressure to upgrade the ending.  At over twice the price, I won't be going down that path again.

But I will be back.  Next time it will be one girl, my way.  ;-)

Deuce out.

Ordered my standard one hour massage. Young Thai girl. Maybe 20 years old. Beautiful skin. 

She began massage with clothes on. I asked for nude and offered tip. She nodded without saying how much. I offered $40. I sensed $40 was excessive by her smile. 

With good tip she was happy girl. Said she wanted to suck my cock. I explained I just wanted a long relaxing HJ with lots of teasing. And that's what I got. 

Lots of nude body sliding. Tits all over my body including the mouth. She asked me to touch. Said its more fun. 

Jerked really slow and built up orgasm. I was shaking all over bed. Taking me right to brink and then slowing it down. Excellent experience.

Hours of Business :  

Rates : $65 half hour

Age : 25 ish

Size/shape : 10

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : rnt

Value for money/recommend? : $65 shit yeah

My experience/comments : went in and was offered a showed.  Accepted and was told to wait in room once showered and a lady would come.  About 10 mins later an Asian lady quite cute come into the room in a short dress.  I noticed the sexual services sign on the wall and thought maybe I shouldnt be lying here naked.  But before I could start to panic the dress comes off and she proceeds to massage me nothing special but relaxing.  20 mins in the bra comes off and a nice set of boobs b to c cup are revealed.  She then gives the balls and but a bit of a rub and gets me to turn over.  Little kayman is quite happy and I get a very brief front rub and then a good quality tug.  During the tug there was a bit of fake moaning and heavy breathing as she grinded away on my leg.  Not sure if extras are available but at that price I will go back.

I'm not going to do a full review, the details are all on the thread here. I can't remember the name of the girl I was with. I got her name, but I can't remember it. If someone says a name I'll be able to confirm, though. If anyone knows multiple girls who work there, throw a few names at me and I'll say if it was them.

Girl was shortish, about usual for a Thai girl (sorry, I don't pay much notice to height), and a bit stocky. Not that she was fat, but curvy might be a better term. She was nice looking in that she was reasonably attractive but also... just seemed nice.

I hadn't been to 100 Mary before, but I had a bad punt elsewhere, a R&T joint that just bothered with the R and forgot the T altogether, so I decided that for the sake of my aching balls I'd go somewhere that was a definite unambiguous jizz-release. 100 Mary was a bit of a hike, but... not by any means unreasonable. The place is small and a little uncomfortably exposed. I popped in late at night and buzzed the front intercom. Was let in by a nice enough looking girl. She asked if I'd been before, etc. I answered all questions correctly. Asked if I wanted a shower before or after, and I chose after. Surprised I get that choice.

100 Mary is unashamedly sexual. They said outright they offer "massage and hand relief". None of this uncertainty about whether you're in for a tug or how much it will cost. Even more, when you get in the place there isn't a massage table. There's a bed. The rooms lights are dim, and my lady came in and stripped completely naked.

I suspect I set the tone pretty thoroughly by lying face up with a hard-on. She didn't bother with the massage, just went straight to the cock, rubbing her breasts all over it, etc. Was very nice. I asked if I could touch her, and was told not pussy, asked if she offered any other services and was pretty much told no. They do what they do there, that seems to be about all.

After a short time of rubbing a very nice hand job ensued, and with a very nice, ample breast in my hand it didn't take long and made a pleasant mess. The lady cleaned me up nicely, then lay down for a cuddle. Stayed for a little while, too. Which was surprisingly pleasant. After a while she got up and I went to have a shower.

All in all I got ripped on the time, I know that. But I don't care, I got what I came for, and I think we both knew that. I can't speak for the massage, because I skipped that part, but the overall experience was great. I'll definitely be back.

Anyone know what happened to 100 Mary Street recently? Do they still offer happy endings, and what is the process? 

On 28th Feb 2012, I got denied at the door. Was told all the ladies were busy. I probed and Hostess explained that massage is by appointment only. She emphasised no extras provided. Her body language was very uncomfortable.

They now have a menu out front. $70 for one hour. Maybe we book first, then negociate with the individual ML with a tip?

The little soldier was devastated. Am feeling mighty frustrated with today's punt.

Lordhardwood, I had a similar experience recently, but didn't write it up yet because I've been busy as fuck.

Basically - I went. Had to wait a little while, which was fine, being a walk-in and all. In stark contrast to my above review, the girl who came was very sedately dressed. Skirt, but not that short, and t-shirt. No stripping. The price was notably different. Enough for me to be confused - as Lordhardwood said, $70 an hour, as opposed to $65 /half hour.

Massage itself was actually pretty good. But despite my nudity it was relatively a tame affair. A towel was kept on my unmentionables. Up to a point. At one point the girl put her hand on my old fella, cupping it through the towel, and had a little chuckle. Then went back to massaging. Later (a few minutes only) she asked if I want... *point* Of course I replied affirmatively and a conversation began that confused the shit out of me.

Basically she said they don't do it anymore. But she could do it if I told absolutely no one. Don't tell my friends, don't tell the girls there, etc. She would do it for a bit extra, and when I asked how much she said $30, to which I agreed.

She really made it clear that this was... above and beyond their services, and said something about people coming to the door asking for things they don't do. Well they sure as hell used to! Anyway, she was quite scandalised by the whole thing, though obviously willing to pocket an extra $30, and I suspect a few of them are. But here's the odd thing: when I came she was careful to catch it all, to keep things clean. Then she got me to carry the tissue evidence with me. :|

I haven't been sure what to think of this and was going to post to ask you guys. I thought it was likely that I got ripped. (I only got 40 minutes of my hour, by the way.) But I think between my experience and Lordhardwood's it's pretty plain to see that 100 Mary has gone legit. Maybe there's some sort of crackdown, or... who knows.

Edit: As an added point, I'm over this shit. If I'm getting a sexual service I'm going to pay enough to know what the fuck I'm getting. I'd rather pay $150 for a decent shag or even to be able to TOUCH the girl than $50 - $80 and not know what I'm even paying for. If I could find a place for a regular massage with a guaranteed HJ, or better still BJ I'd be down. But this "you may or may not get" bullshit is pointless.

Was in Brisbane for a couple of nights on business last month, staying just round the corner from this establishment.

1st night I rock up about 20:30 to get at the door by a pretty young thing, who informs me that they don't do extras - and gave me the number of a private just out of town that might suit me, but as I've got no transport I give it a miss.

2nd night I rock up quite late, around 21:30 to be greeted by a different girl at the door, she asked me if I wanted a massage (no mention of extras) so I thought I'd take a punt. Took a quick shower, and lay down. Massage started routinely enough, but as she got to my legs, she started with a bit of teasing, which turned into a bit more, and come the turn over she pops the question. $30 for HR but she wasn't prepared to remove any of her clothing. It was however a very sensual experience, with lots more teasing before the finale.

Unfortunately I didn't get quite get her name (Lily perhaps?) but it would seem that this establishment may still be worth a try.

I was in the CBD so went to revisit 100 Mary st. All very legit now but massage was very firm which I needed. Most of my sore muscles catered for except one..lol. Strangely, i thought I saw the Mamasan and she was the same one that ran the place way back when they were still in Berry st. Ugh, will have to find another RNT place in the CBD/valley area. May well go back to private RNT girls....

In Brisbane on business and walked past this place. I honestly had not read these reviews but the first hint it may have been offering extras was the 11PM closing time.

So after my meeting I had a gap and walked back up the stairs to be met by a buzzer - another nice sign I was in the right sort of massage place.

I buzzed ... and stood there for maybe 3 minutes ,,, nothing ! So i buzzed again. The next exciting sign was a lovely asian lady rushing out of a room half way down the hall with a towel loosely wrapped around her showing her breasts. She yelled out to someone and scurried back exposing her arse. Hmmm I thought another good sign !

As I entered I noticed at the end of the hall was a back exit so I felt i was in the right place. The door had been opened by a young pretty thai woman - maybe early 20s and she rushed me to a room and asked me how long I chose $70 for an hour. She told me to get undressed and have a shower if I wanted which I did. It was then that I realised the lady who rushed out with the towel around her was in the shower right next to me - a gap at the top of the wall. I heard her scrubbing her teeth and garling and got excited at the thought of a nice BBBJ and CIM.

I lay on the table naked and waited. And waited. .... And waited - kinda like 10 minutes - almost to the point of getting up and walking to find out what was happening. I had also noticed the mirrors on the wall at bed height so thought YES i am definitely in a R&T place - looking good.

I also hear the mobile of the lady who got out of the adjoining shower ring 3 times and she quotes a price and says bye-bye. So this is the place to be !!

So in comes the same young lady who had welcomed me. I thought my lucky day. She puts on a CD of love songs starting with "Lady in red" Now sounding good too.

And proceeds to give me an excellent massage covered by a towel and no private touch at all. Remains fully clothed. No offer of anything at all.

afte she finishes the excellent massage she leaves me sitting there listening to a country and western love ballad. I felt it was very appropriate !

So I dress and leave. Nice $70 massage and thinking well it must be legit. 

Only to log in and find there is some action to be had !!!

My only thought is that they were busy and the young girl did the straight thing to get me in and out.

So what can I say 9/10 for the massage - very good. 5/10 for the welcome. And 0/10 for offering me what they do offer and would have been appreciated.

I poppoed in to 100 Mary St last Thursday keen for a r&t in Brisbane CBD which I have found hard to find. A pretty young thing (Amy) opened the door dressed in short shorts and a t-shirt. $70 for an hour and I hopped naked on the bed. Amy started the CD "Lady in Red" from above, LOL. 

The massage started with no mention of extras or any sexy business. As the massage progressed she would rub her leg against my arm and I began to rub back. At one point she had my arm up my back and she would place her boob in my hand as she stretched me. Nice.

On the flip she draped a towel over my dick as she massaged all around but the towel kept slipping to reveal all. 

I asked about extra and she said $50? I said $50 for nude? She said $50 for topless? I agreed, probably overpaid but she had a spectaculr rack! Good size C cups and a very nice HJ style. I finished up licking nipples and blowing hard. 

Amy was good value, very pretty, about 5'8", really nice rack with long smooth legs. I would say she is late 20's and has long black hair.

I would definately repeat!

I was here on the weekend and although they no longer do extras, I've always found the massage pretty good so I keep coming back. Anyway I had a good conversation with Shampoo(?) about this place having extras a year ago when she mentioned that the boss has another massage place somewhere in the city that offers extras but she wasn't around for me to confirm. Anyone care to confirm this if your dropping in this premises. I do like a good release after a good firm massage.

 Establishment : Thai Tantra Massage

 Date of Visit : 22-3-14

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 100 Mary Street Bribane  0404 445 682

 Hours of Business : 10 am - 9 pm

 Rates : $50 half / $70 full hour  hj $50 / nude $100

 Age : 20’s

 Size/shape : slim average build

 Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

 Services Provided : Therapeutic massage / extras was offered but declined

 Value for money/recommend? : yes for therapeutic massage + shower facilities / extras was too pricey

 My experience/comments : 

Well it’s been a while since I last visited this place as the last few occasions I was turned away as they were really busy. I used to see the a ladyboy here and he gave a very exquisite massage but not sure if he’s still around. Now the  good news: I was offered extras on my visit today after it had been off the menu a while back now. The bad news: a happy ending starts at $50 and nude is $100!! WTF! This is the third Brissie massage place to offer those rates that I’ve encountered in recent times. Is this a new thing going around now?!

Anyway, I visited this place because the massage provided is very good and the girls all know how to give a firm technique. I hadn’t considered extras as it had been off the table. The first thing I noticed upon entering was they’ve decorated the place a little since I was last here and Allysa had this new uniform top/blouse really showed off her tits. A little provocative and it got me curious. Besides the good massage, the other reason i keep coming back was that this is the only massage place in the cbd that also has shower facilities and Thai massage always end up oily. From a therapeutic massage session, Allysa delivered and my aches and pains were kneaded out of me. I would’ve been perfectly happy if that’s how the session ended but Allysa offered me extras and there was no way I was paying that much for a HJ so it was a tad of a mood killer towards the end. All in all, Not a bad massage, shame about the extras. I did get to rub one out during my shower so happy ending, I guess?

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 0422 078 895

Hours of Business: 10am – 10:00pm,

Rates: $70.00 for the hour 

Age: Late 20’s early 30’s

Size/shape: Nice body, bolt-ons and Tatts

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai

Services Provided: Shit Massage extras mediocre, 

Value for money/recommend? : Rang and made a 1 hour appointment at about 9:15pm, got there walked up the stairs am met by Champoo who says “we only hear to 10”, so only half hour massage available”. I then say I have booked an hour she reluctantly accepts what I say and say “you come earlier next time” – good start- not.

Am lead to clean room with shower facilities after fixing up the financials, where I am told to undress and lie face down, within a few minutes Champoo returns to give one of the worst Thai Massages I have ever had, no pressure, but it was so bad it could not even be called sensual/erotic. I make a grab for her leg, and she says “ No touch yet we have extras latter I can’t concentrate on massage if you touch me”. 

Anyway this excuse for a massage continues for another 10 minutes and then am told, “turn over”, I am still as limp as a dead plant. As the experience continues  I say “how about extras”, am told HJ and touching outside the clothes $50, Topless & HJ $100, nude and HJ $150. So we negotiate for topless and HJ for $70, I still don’t know why, but anyway. She takes her top of and am allowed to fiddle with these nice size bolt-ons that sit straight out, the redeeming factor was the reasonable nice nipples. She then proceeds to give a mediocre HJ. Once all this is over we have chat as she gives me a nice head massage (best part of the whole experience) apart from the shower afterward, where she came in a rubbed the oil of my back and front with some liquid soap. BTW she has a huge tatt on the back and one on her side at the front, not very appealing.
WIR: NO!.

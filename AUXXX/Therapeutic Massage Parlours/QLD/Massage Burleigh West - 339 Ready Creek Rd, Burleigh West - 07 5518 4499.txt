[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments: 


I've seen this place open during the last month or so, and finally got the chance to give it a try.     The entrance is right next to the adult shop on Reedy Creek road, so, it's a rather quiet entry to the upstairs setup.

I was greeted by a reasonable good looking young girl at the counter, who was to be my massuese for the day.

I chose the 40minute option, to see what would happen. and was show to the cubicle.   Even though it,s quite a private setup with 3-4 booths, the walls DO NOT go all the way up....

All in all, the massage was actually quite good, and, as it was the first mission to this place, I was not sure what to expect.   It was a place that I thought mid massage that if nothing happens I'd still leave happy, as the massage provided was actually quite good.

There was the odd accidental touch of the tackle, so, I thought, here we go ![/COLOR].....   Upon turnover, more massaging happened, and, before I knew it, I was told that it was all finished...  ....  no happy ending today... 

I suspect there MAY be more on offer, so, in the interests of research I will go again in the next few days to see if things improve....    

IF you want a decent massage - then sure this place is ok.

If you want a RNT - perhaps for now, give it a miss....

I will update this thread if things um, pick up....

Cheers

Person's Name : Tina (Teena?)

Establishment : West Burleigh Massage.

Date of Visit : 19. Aug. 2015.

Hours of Business : 7Days. 9 Am Till Late.

Rates : $55..1Hr..$40..40.mins...$30..30mins.

Age : Early 20's

Size/shape : slim, size 7,A/B cups.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese.

Services Provided : Massage. HE.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes/Yes.

My experience/comments : 
After my last two massages, Thai Orchid, very good (but no HE) the other, HQ Oriental, well below average(IMHO) I decided to head over to West Burleigh to try this shop; I had seen them advising in the Bulletin, but had never been.. Their shop is located upstairs in a complex near the intersection of Reedy Crk Rd and Mattocks Rd, they are off the service Rd; their entry is next door to an adult shop.
I climbed the stairs into what was a very spacious, open area, which seemed to be very clean.
I was met at reception by Tina, a pleasant girl, wearing short shorts and a tank top.(The view from behind was exquisite.  ) 
I opted for half hour and she took me across the (large) room to the massage cubicles; I say cubicles because that's all they were; areas surrounded by walls only about 3mtrs in height made out of what looked like varnished brushwood fencing...The room itself was very large, aprox 5mtrs X 5mtrs and contained two tables.
Tina left me to undress etc. She returned a couple of minutes later and things got underway.. To describe her massage skills: very good,she uses her arms/forearms mainly (I like this technique) but also uses her hands on the upper leg/thigh area . Whilst doing the back she mounted the table and straddled my legs and bum, these areas were subjected to a fantastic mini massage as she ground her pussy up and down on my legs and into my arse .
Unfortunately this pussy action didn't continue on the front, pity, as by this time Caybee Jr was ready for action: the said action was negotiated for $20. and the fun began....She is very good at what she does,so it wasn't long before I was rewarded with blessed relief 
The only downside to this visit was, that on completion she stopped tugging and teasing and let things take their course. Then after a quick wipe she left the towel on my junk for me to finish the cleanup..
But all in all, a pretty good visit.. 
Would I return?...Probably yes, if in the area..There was another girl there when I entered, she looked very,very sexy, probably size 8 and shapely...Actually,they were both ushering another punter through to (I guess) the showers..So in all likelihood he had just received a double..(Lucky guy).

was holidaying up that way, so made an excuse to get out.......

Paid for one hour and there was no discussion about 'extras'

Part 1 was a very competent massage for 45 minutes. no TT at all.

Part 2 was offered and despite the stupid high price, I agreed....ordinary jack off......studying English been there 3 years......

I think this stuff is illegal so hence to high price......see the next review and it gets even worse......

A review without the ladies name is worthless to others wishing to book or avoid the lady.   Reviews are about the lady not the establishment.

I asked her four time her name and she did not disclose.

Sorry, I do take your point, but not much I could do....

I pondered as to whether I should even post my review, but given there is so little reviews of shops up there, I thought I would at least offer something....

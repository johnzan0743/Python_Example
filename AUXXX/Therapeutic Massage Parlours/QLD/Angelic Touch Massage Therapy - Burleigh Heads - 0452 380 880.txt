Shop been operating just a few weeks and is all curtain tracking as in Hospital ward. 3 or 4 beds and no privacy really but as i was the only punter didnt matter. She locked the door and started a firm massage as i had a sore lower back. This was excellent put on some chinese oil on problem area and man it didnt take long to penetrate. the massage was great a lot of experience here and chatted as we went along. Asked bout touching all good not that i really wanted to but keen to find out seeing im there. Flopped the old boob out for me to suck while playin with the old ming I think everything would be on here but too old for me need something young to make me rise at this stage of life.

Person's Name : Jenny

Establishment : Angelic Massage

Date of Visit : 12.5.14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0452 380880. 109 West Burleigh Rd.

Hours of Business : 9Am--7Pm.

Rates : $30:00 half hr. $50:00 1 hr [specials I think] +$20

Age : Early 20's

Size/shape : Thin Size 6 no boobs that I could see

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese 

Services Provided : Massage. RnT offered

Value for money/recommend? : Probably.

My experience/comments :      Out on the prowl again on Monday. I spotted this shop advertising in the Gold Coast Bulletin. As I hadn't seen the add before I figured it was a new one so thought I'd give it a try. It's in a small shopping complex on the service road just before the service station [BP I think]. The shop itself is next-door to a tattoo parlour in the complex. When I arrived I was seen by Jenny and was told the prices. I did notice as well the massage areas are only curtained off cubicles, so I started to wonder if this place might be legit  Anyway went ahead with the half hour option to test the waters. Into the cubicle and was told to undress and mount up.[the table] Jenny came back after a couple of minutes and asked: soft, med or hard? I opted for soft, this is my preference. It was very light and I found it enjoyable. There was some very slight grazing of the equipment along the way. This continued after the turn and after a few minutes she asked if I would like a HE, before I could answer she informed me she didn't do this and another girl would do the deed. Now, whilst having my massage there was another punter having a session in the next cubicle, I could hear everything that was going on, including some very deep breathing so one doesn't need to be a genius to know what was going on. As this would be the girl who would perform the HE I declined. In any case I don't particularly like it when they do the old switceroo at the end, it just doesn't do it for me. I don't mind if the switch is done with 15 or so minutes to go as I can connect a bit with the new girl [so long as she isn't a fugly dragon.] Anyway got dressed and left the cubicle, on the way out I saw the other girl [she had finished with her client and was sitting down at the front. She looked quite nice to me. Her name is Mia, she would be in her early 30's about size 8 with what appeared to be a nice set of "c"'s. I made a mental note to return and try her out from the beginning with a 1 hr massage. I asked her how much for the HE, she replied $20:00. So I think either half hr or 1 hr would be good value.
Will I return?...... That's a yes for me..

No problems AS. 
However, as I mentioned I think these prices are a special, so I don't know how long they will be in place or how much they will be charging when they finish,only time will tell. My guess would be they would probably be in line with other AMP's....IE: $40/$50 half hr and $70/$80 1 hr. I will be away for a month, but will try them again on my return to test the waters. Maybe someone else will have paid them a visit and posted a review before then to let us know how things stand

Person's Name : Mia & Bonnie.

Establishment : Angelic massage.

Date of Visit : 18.06.2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0452 380880. 109 West Burleigh Rd.

Hours of Business : 9am-7pm.

Rates : Now $40 half hr. $65... Dual $130. hr

Age : Both prob mid 30's

Size/shape : Size 8 a little chubby (both)

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese.

Services Provided : Massage HE.($20 extra)

Value for money/recommend? : Yes/yes.

My experience/comments : 
Returned to the above establishment, as I should have on the 11th. Phoned ahead and made a booking for a dual session with Mia and one other. This turned out to be Bonnie, I think Bonnie might be the Mammasan as she made my booking, also she answered all the incoming calls and made the bookings.[ there were quite a lot, also a steady stream of punters coming and going].
I was shown into the room, undressed and onto the table. Mia came in and started the massage and Bonny entered a couple of mins later. The usual dual, one massaging the top half and one on the bottom half. However they did alternate by massaging down the sides of my body as they changed positions. A little bit of tickle happened during this process, which got MiniMe interested and longing for a bit of action.. I might add at this stage..When I say massage I'm probably a bit incorrect as it was more of a firmish body rub, not entirely unpleasant but not a proper massage either. Anyway the session proceeded for the next 25-30 mins; was then asked to turn over, which I duly did. After the turn, strangely enough, I was covered with a towel.[they didn't do this when I was on my stomach] The action continued for a further 15mins or so, at this stage Bonnie left the room while Mia continued with the business at hand. After a couple of mins she rolled the towel down and paid some welcome attention to the equipment which, at this point in time was making it well known just what was required. She put the question to me....Yes ,Yes Yes....Fantastic, Mias technique is very, very good, very light and teasing,she doesn't rush and kept me on edge and enjoying every minute of it. She kept this up until I indicated it was time, she then proceeded with a more conventional HJ [still nice] till I emptied the sack.
All up a satisfactory and pleasurable experience..Although I don't think I will indulge in a dual massage again [at least for a while].....This time I would have preferred to have had a dual with Mia and Jenny. Even though Jenny doesn't do HE her massage is very light and teasing/erotic....Anyway, it wasn't to be, So maybe next time I indulge at this establishment... 
In finishing I'd like to say Mia is good value, if only for the ending....Having said that, there's a possibility her massage may be a lot better when she is working alone. Not that she was at all terrible during my session..
In closing I would like to point out that this shop seems to be very well patronised, there was at least one punter enter at least 10 mins before me and a further 3or4 whilst I was in there: also Bonnie would have answered at least 3 calls and Mia 1 during my session..In fact I had to leave via the back door as there was another customer waiting in reception......  What I'm getting at is,I would have expected to see a few more reviews on this shop, given how busy it seems to be.
Anyway happy punting all...

My experience/comments: After my dismal effort at Sunshy, I decided to again refer to the Courier Mail for another option.

This place is just down from the main strip of shops, a stand alone house.

Greeted by Levare - cute, slim chinese girl, who led me to a room. After confirming how long I would like to stay (30 mins), she instructed me to take my clothes off and lay face down on the table, as she left the room.

The room - appeared 100% legit. Not cheap and nasty, rather tastefully decked out. And the killer blow...a big sign stating no sexual services. In Sydney, these are a dime a dozen and 9 times out of 10 you get extras. But this sign wasn't vague...it didn't leave me with any second thoughts...it gave the impression they were 100% when it came to any extras...that is....it ain't happening.

Anyhow, Levare returned, provided me with a very high quality remedial massage, face down for the full 30 mins, not a hint of brushing little BAB along the way. Levare turned out to be a lovely young lady. Not drop-dead gorgeous, but I did find her attractive in a sense, which was only enhanced by her personality.

If you want a great legit remedial massage, this place is highly recommended. If you are chasing extras, I would suggest it is unlikely if not certain not to happen.

Cheers,

BAB

BAB,

Brisbane? You do get around.

But I don't think that I will be going to a place where  "extras" are not likely.

Someone has been reading the wrong section of CM! How about just asking the girl out after the legitimate massage? Might be cheaper and more fun that way...

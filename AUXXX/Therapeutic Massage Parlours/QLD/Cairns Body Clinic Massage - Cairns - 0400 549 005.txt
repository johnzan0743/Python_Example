 Value for money/recommend? :  Yes. Good sensual massage. Great value at $50

My experience/comments: Decided to check this place out after discovering that they offer massages. From the entrance it looked like they just offer the fish spa thing where small fish nibble on your feet. Greeted by a guy and asked for a massage. $50 cash only (he doesn't take cards). Two girls were working - Thai and Japanese. I got the Thai girl. She mentioned later that she thought all the other girls were Japanese. Taken out the back where the two partitioned off massage 'rooms' are. Not a great set up as there are no proper rooms or walls for privacy. Thai girl showed me to the massage table and asked me to undress but to leave my underpants on and to lie face down. Seemed like a bad sign. She then came back and went to drape a towel over me. I was feeling bit warm and said no need for the towel. She was quite happy with that. She then pulled down my undies a little to get to my bum and that's when things got interesting. Even though I had my undies on she spent most of the time massaging my bum. She would push deeply inside my undies and down around my thighs. It felt really good and very sensual. On the flip she spent most of the time on my thighs with plenty of close brushing. Felt great. So all up a very relaxing sensual message. I might return and see if a HJ might be on offer from this girl. But with just flimsy partitions for walls, doing a HJ could be tricky. As always in there sorts of places YMMV.

Cairns is the city of mostly unhappy endings...

But if you'd like HE with a 40+ older Chinese then head to 31A McLeod St (near Cairns Central) - 0449 707 542.

Noticed recently that there's a new place opened just south of the CBD on the main road: Jing Massage Therapy (07 40410461). Pics and description on Gumtree look ok. I should check it out and see what might be on offer.

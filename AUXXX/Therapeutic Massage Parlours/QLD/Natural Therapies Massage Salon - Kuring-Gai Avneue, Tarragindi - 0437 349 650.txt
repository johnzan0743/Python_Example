My experience/comments : 

This place is a lot out of the way for me. It is nestled in a nice quiet area. Must be hard to get business through there.

This is actually a 2 appointment post, as I did not make the request on the 1st go. After making the appointment, I walked in the door to be greeted by a drop-dead stunner of Asian ethnicity. Pretty face, hot body, beautiful smile. 

Walked into the room and spotted the box of tissues straight away. Then, spotted management's obligatory, "Please respect our staff by not asking" sign. Asked for a hard massage and Melody delivered. It was a really strong massage and very good in its own right.

Flipped over and got up a boner pretty quickly. She didn't touch it inadvertantly, and went around it at all times. At the end, she said that's it and I left it at that.

I knew it was on at this place, so I went back 2 days later. Same girl, same massage, no offer to sort out my boner. I think Melody will not make the first move, ever. So, I pointed at my knob and asked, "can you do that?" She said she could and quoted the price.

The tug itself was nothing special, but with all the anticipation, I was done in a matter of seconds (which I always like).

So, rest assured, you will have to ask and she may not go for it on the 1st appoinment (not sure about that). But she does take your money when offered!

I checked this shop the other day.  Had the same girl, Melody.  She's dark, looks cambodian/thai, but she reckons she's Chinese.  
She was nothing special.  Also the place had a bad smell to it.. it smelt like deep heat, tiger balm?

She offered for $30 but no touching or topless or nude.  So I declined.  
It's a tiny shop, I think it only has two rooms.

Thanks svanoz. Happy to help.

Somtimes, I quite like it when they keep their clothes on. But yes, I don't think Melody will go too far at this early stage in her career as a hand maiden. Perhaps in a year or so she'll get more adventurous. Shy girl.

 Tarragindi Asian Massage  Kuring-Gai Ave
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Sandy

Establishment : Natural Therapies Massage Salon

Date of Visit : 3/11/12

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :  Kuring-Gai Avenue, Tarragindi

Hours of Business : 10 till 6.30pm every day

Rates : 60mins / $60  30mins / $40

Age : 23ish

Size/shape : 8 b/c cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Yes - girls are always accommodating here

My experience/comments :  I've found this to be one of the most reliable of the many Asian massage parlours in Brisbane.  The girls are always flexible although different girls are more flexible thank others.  Sandy is not my first choice, but is very pretty.  Provides a soft powder massage and is happy to have her legs and butt touched for no extra charge.  You can finish yourself, or pay another $40 for assistance.  Overall fine for this type of thing.

Sandy will provide hand relief for an extra $40. Not sure if more than that is on offer (I've never asked). I chose not to indulge this time. She does a soft teasing massage that brushes against your balls and cock, but no more than this without a tip. However playing with your nipples and having her legs and butt touched are all fine for the regular price. Better service than many of the other asian massage joints.

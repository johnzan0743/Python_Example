Hello fellow punters.
Driving home along Brisbane Rd yesterday....... As I was passing labrador Park shopping centre I noticed a large banner style sign with 'MASSAGE' written on it; on the shop front was "58 Massage". I was wondering if any G.C punters have tried this place yet.. Judging by the name, 58 massage, I'm assuming it is a sister shop to 25 massage which is about 1 klm east on Bris.Rd and also 23 massage in Nind st Southport. I know the girls who work at 25 and 23 alternate between shops, so if 58 is affiliated  I guess this will be the case here as well. Has anyone tried yet?.....I will eventually, but I have others to try before I do. [As I have been to both 25 and 23 numerous times I expect the service to be pretty much the same] They would more than likely have some of their more experienced working there as it is a new establishment. The location is in a fairly busy little shopping complex which is open to a busy section of Brisbane Rd. So if discretion is required it might not be the best option; the entry opens onto a fairly busy(foot traffic) verandah type walkway....
If anyone has tried, could they please confirm my thoughts, re their connection to the other two shops...

Ok, thanks for the info, this is the first time I've seen it, but then I don't often take that route home. What got my attention was the large [aprox 2.5x1.5mt] banner hanging off the rail out front. Strange it's been around so long and no reviews,none that I cancan find anyway...Maybe someone can enlighten us..
Cheers.

Ok guys....Curiosity got the better of me. So this afternoon I took a detour to check this shop out (not for a massage) just to find out what's what.....Walked in and was greeted by a chinese lady, probably about 50yo or so. One of the first things I noticed was the 3 massage cubicles, these are only curtained off areas; that put paid to my assumption that this shop is affiliated with the 2 above mentioned establishments. I asked and she confirmed as much...I would be confident to say this is a legit practice..But you never know..I wont be trying them out any time soon: if I want a massage only I will go to Nucy..
If any one wants to give this place a try, the address is: shop17/100 Brisbane Rd Labrador..Ph: (07)56793550...Hrs: 9am--6:30pm..
They describe themselves as:-
Gold Coast 58Massage is specialised in premium Acupressure massage which helps correcting muscle imbalances and joint misalignments..Ideal for the body's aches and pains..

This probably explains the lack of reviews..

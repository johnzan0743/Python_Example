About the 45 minute mark, rolled over (after playing with tackle and gentle brushing whilst laying face down) and gave me a nice HJ, although it did fell a little robotic. Only allowed touching over clothes. I would go back as I feel should would relax over a few visits.

My experience/comments : ............I had seen this place advertised in the past and also the above post by jonor (posted on 30/11/12.). Since Nucys departure I have been looking for a ML who can provide a really good massage with a fair amount of erotism. (I would prefer it to include a happy ending, but if not, the erotic content could provide for a worthwhile punt elsewhere).
On with the story... Having seen jonors post I reckoned there might be an outside chance of a happy outcome, so I fronted up with the expectation of at least receiving a descent massage ( with maybe a little tease)...I was met at the reception by Oh and was shown the menu. I opted for 60min oil massage for $70. and was offered a 10% disc. which I accepted. I was then asked to remove my shoes (thongs) and was taken down a hallway of white pebbles with stepping stones imbedded in them.. The establishment has only 3 massage rooms that I could see. these are small (2 mtrs x 4 mtrs) curtained off areas which can be opened to allow access to the adjoining room.(1st bad sign) Once in the said room I was asked to remove all my clothes but to leave my underwear on(2nd bad sign   ). Also the massage was to be performed on the floor on a Thai style mattress.... She came back after about 3mins and the massage began. She had a soothing touch and her massage was just the right pressure (not too hard and not too soft ). She moved on to my legs and thigh area; once again she had a very nice touch whilst working on the thigh buttock areas, but, alas, nothing erotic... When time came to turn over she held the towel up to shield her from my 'boy' bits. I don't know why,nothing was on show, due to the fact I was wearing undies.. Anyway the massage progressed on the front, mainly on the legs,thighs, the upper chest and shoulders and also a fair bit of work on the neck area. It seemed like no time at all and my hour was up and the session had come to an end. Unfortunately with no erotic content. But, all up a very good massage.
It's very unlikely that I will return, due to the (very) legit nature of the place. However for anyone wanting a good Thai style (or oil) massage, this could be for you.
Also I noticed another Thai massage shop up the road from them at No.57 James St. If I'm in Burleigh again I might give them a try and see what they have to offer...Sadly though, I have a feeling this is another legit shop. But...One never knows..(Maybe a fellow user has been and can give us a headsup.)

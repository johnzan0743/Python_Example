My experience/comments : Arrived and was greeted at the door by a woman who introduced me to Sasa. She looked cute.
Asked for a medium massage, little harder than I was hoping but likely due to no oil being used.
She does not mind getting close to you during the rub though.
After maybe 15 minutes she runs her nails/fingers over my whole backside of my body including a few fingers across balls/dick from underneath. Gets up onto the table and starts moaning into my ear.
Turn over, asks for $40 extra and HJ ensued.

Decent HJ, average massage.

Lady offered for me to take the Sasa home for an hour for $300 but I politely declined

Post Content: 
Person's Name: Didn't ask

Establishment : 153 Cotlew Street, Ashmore (officey block next to Hungry Jacks)

Date of Visit: Not sure... within the last month?

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: GC Bulletin Ad, 0406 041 388

Hours of Business: 7 days til about 7pm

Rates: $40 for 1/2hr

Age: Varies

Size/shape: Varies

Nationality or Ethnicity: Asian

Services Provided: Massage with happy ending. Extras probably likely

Value for money/recommend?: $40 HJ... so yes I reckon it is.

My experience/comments: Been to this place a couple of times and seen the same girl both times. Mid twenties probably, but being asian it's hard to tell.  She is not bad looking with huge tits which she will get out and let you feel for $20 extra.  She never minds if you rub her pussy through her pants while giving the HJ.  She once offered me a blowjob for an extra $20 but I declined.  There is another older asian lady there too, which I have seen at another asian massage place once before. She is good too, but older. Both of them will play with your asshole, but the older lady is much more into it. She offerd me FS at the other place for $80.  Overall I don't mind this place for a nice cheap massage with happy ending.  The massage is never really that great and you'll be lucky to end up with more than 20mins, but that's not really what I go for   There's quite a lot of these cheap asian massage places popping up all over the Gold Coast.  I've been to quite a few of them, so will post some more reviews when time permits.

I've been here as well, I paid for the hour which was about $80 and paid for her to get the gear off for an extra $20.  My massage was awesome very deep and hard, the only problem was I was face down most of the time so couldn't appreciate the view.  The massage went for about 40 minutes non stop, with her at one point standing on my back.  She was only a youngish girl with limited english, and I have been offered blowjob for an extra $50 one time and $30 the next as pricing seems to be all over the place so it is good to bargain.  One time when I partook she told me I had to keep very very quiet.  Just be careful as if you keep saying yes to whats on offer it can add up, not just here but at these places generally.

Person's Name: Stephanie (I think)

Establishment : Chinese Massage & Relaxation Centre

Date of Visit: 3/4/11

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 153 Cotlew St, Ashmore - 0406 041 388

Hours of Business: 8am - 7pm

Rates: $40 per half hour

Age: Mid twenties

Size/shape: Small in height, maybe a maximum of 160cm. Thin, breasts were a small C cup.

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese apparently.

Services Provided: Full body massage, and happy ending.

Value for money/recommend?:

Found this place through the advertisements in the paper, the business has a reasonable size premises and seems to do legitimate massages more so than 'naughty massages'.
They have a separate mobile number for the naughty side (listed above).

The girl was very cute, talkative but with limited English, she wouldn't allow touching but did a very good providing pleasure for me. I would certainly visit again.

The massage itself was $40 for the half hour (that is their official price for a massage).
As I booked on the special phone number almost straight away the girl said it will be $20 for a magic touch (hj), she implied if I paid more I could get more, but on my first time I thought I would keep it simple.
I got the impression the extras cost is somewhat negotiable, but I didn't press it.

So total I paid $60 for half an hour, which seems pretty cheap for a R&T (Although this is my first one, so I'm not entirely sure).

I've never paid more than $40 total for 1/2 with HJ at this place.  Extras usually consist of +$10-$20 for tits out, or the one time I was offered a BJ for +$20 ($60 total).  $40 (sometimes $50) for 1/2 at these Gold Coast Asian RnT places is standard and includes HJ.  Extras are quite often +$10 for tits, +$20 for nude, then a few do more than that.  I'm never interested in more than RnT so I can't comment much on that other than what I mentioned in the original post.

Pussy Massage

In today for my first visit. It is unit no.3 at 153 Cotlew St, on Level 1 (Ground).

Mamasan and one ML at reception, another room was closed. Into a room with reasonable looking ML, name Mandy. Vietnamese, says 25, but in 30s. (Note: not the same Mandy, she says, that works in Parkwood.) Room has massage table and a shower.

Pretended I had been before by giving her $40 for 30 mins. Nude up she comes back, and signals straight away she would go nude for extra $20, so OK.

Now the massage was quite unique - it was an allover pussy rub. She started on my back, worked up to the shoulders just by straddling me and rubbing the oil with her pussy. Then she goes over to reverse pussy rub (i.e. pointing the other way like in RCG) and works down my back, onto each leg individually then my ass. All good, and while doing the ass starts with tackle tickle and anal play. She eventually hops off and continues one hand underneath me on the cock and sack, and the other fingering my ass. Now I let her know I am enjoying this, so she doms up a finger for some intense prostate play.

When I'm ready I roll over and she mounts me in pseudo CG for handjob against her pussy. All good, but to finish I get her over my face with her ass up in the air and digitally DP her while she makes me come like a volcano.

Cleanoff, into the shower together, there is a soap dispenser.

So a worthwhile experience for $60 for the 25 mins. Other extras were available but I didn't consider them VFM.

Mandy says she works M-F. Would see again.

Went back here for another visit about a month or 2 ago I think.  I wanted to see how far I could get them down on price and ended up with a $30 15 min HJ only. Forgot to ask the girl's name.

It was pretty cool really... I just literally dropped my pants and laid back on the table (shoes and all) and she got straight into it.  I have to say she had a really good technique.  She must have used a 1/4 of the bottle of baby oil!  I usually don't like too much oil because sometimes it causes too much loss of essential friction, but this was different.  She had so much oil on, she managed to get some sort of suction happening and it actually felt quite like a BJ.  The ending was a bit dud though (just stopped at the first sign of cum, so I had to finish of while she washed her hands).

As I walked out into the waiting room, the other lady had burnt her toast so badly it got in my clothes so good I could even smell it in my car for 2 days later!  She mentioned that they were moving premises and gave me a new card. I had to "destroy the evidence" and I don't recall where they were moving to (Bundall I think).

I went around to Cotlew St about 3 weeks ago, and the place was closed. I haven't bothered about ringing.

Yep, that is sad news desi. I only went there once, checking my review now it was Anzac Day. Good value. I just hope our reviews in open forum like this do not lead to their premature demise.

Does anyone know where they moved to? Bundall was mentioned, but it appears neither 94 nor 4/106 Bundall Rd is the place.

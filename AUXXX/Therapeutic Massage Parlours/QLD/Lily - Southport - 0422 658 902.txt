My experience/comments :  I'd been meaning to check this place out for some time and knocked on the door and I could here some chinese women talking loudly in the kitchen about something and they couldn't hear me knocking so had to wait for some time till they stopped talking, the door bell is broken.  Finally a frumpy looking old MLC woman answered the door and showed me to a room.  Nice big rooms and nice timber floors and really nice big wide massage table. I opted for the 30min massage. She gave me a half decent massage with a little stroking to the inner thigh area and asked me to turn over.  You cant touch her and she doesn't want to talk much but not a bad hj. Cleaned me up and was gone.  Might go back one day.  There is another really fat MLC woman working there, if she had been the one doing the massage I would not have stayed, I think I've seen her at 172 Scarborough St. and another place on Ferry road.

Value for money/recommend? : YES

My experience/comments :

Called up the old number of this place and they were still in business. Jenny has gone back to China so now it's Amy (who looks about 60 and is quite overweight) and Helen (maybe 50), then owner. Amy started the massage and did a good job for about 20-25 minutes. When she was done she left and Helen came back for hand relief. Helen is a real pro and even though she is quite old she turned me on very well with her skillful touch. She pulled her skirt and her top up to let me play with her ass and big, firm tits. That was all inclusive of the $50 for 30 minutes, so I reckon it was good value for money.

Visited Lily after an unsuccessful session at 25 Massage. ( Review to follow in about a week) I have been to this establishment before quite a while ago and seemed to remember it wasn't too bad,so, as time was running out I thought I'd head straight there; I didn't phone first so I was lucky she wasn't busy. Anyway walked in and asked for half hour and was duly shown to the room , which is quite large and well lit. Lily left me to undress and mount the the table which was sporting clean towels. She re entered after a couple of minutes and started straight into the massage. Her massage is on the firm side of medium,she got her thumbs and elbows into the shoulder and back muscles, but not to the degree it became uncomfortable or painful: overall it was quite an enjoyable massage. This went on for I would guess 25 mins (I was beginning to think she thought I'd asked for 1 Hr[I hadn't paid yet] so didn't know if she had heard me properly when I asked).But all's well. She then started on the more pleasurable teasing part or the massage. She started to dribble oil on my freckle so at this point I was wondering just how penetrating this massage was going be, it turned out to be just for lube.  It wasn't too long before she had me up on my hands and knees ,and I was being looked after very nicely thank you.At this time she asked if I wanted to finish in this position or on my back; no brainer, I wasn't going to move whilst the action where I was was feeling so good.When I indicated this she spread a tea towel on the table beneath the tackle where the shot was going to land. As I was nearing the inevitable conclusion I rose up on my knees and slid my hand down her top to fondle her boobs, to my surprise she wasn't wearing a bra so I got to have a play with a very nice pair of quite firm 'B's. (I was surprised, given her age.Also she had small nipples,not grape sized like some Asians.[ Not that I would ever complain about that]). This concluded the afternoons activities so I handed over $50;00 and was surprised to be given $10:00 change( I was sure it was $50 half Hr when I was last there.) All in all a very pleasant half hour spent with Lily. I will return to see this lady but not on a regular basis(too many others I have on my bucket list, not her service).Anyway guys I'm off fishing for a week so will post a couple more reports on my return..

Mods. I've  noticed this establishment has been reviewed before back in Feb and July 2013. The reviews are in the massage parlour section. (36 George st Southport.)It looks like I have posted in the wrong section. Could you please rectify my error.
Thanks.
Caybee..

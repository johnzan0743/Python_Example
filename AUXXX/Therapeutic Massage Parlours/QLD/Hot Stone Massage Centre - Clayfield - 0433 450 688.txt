My experience/comments : I spotted an ad for a new massage shop in the Brisbane CM and thought I should check it out. The shop is clean and modern, two staff on the day ... Alice and another, with a client when I arrived. Alice appeared to be the receptionist, however she set me up in a near room and said she would massage me. The rooms (at least the one I occupied) have solid walls but don't extend to the ceiling so you can hear pretty much everything going on around you. She is pretty and reasonably tall and speaks good English. I'm not keen on having my jocks oiled up during massage so I stripped right off and onto the table ... no comment from Alice.

She proceeded with a relaxation style massage, too soft for my tight bits so I asked for stronger and she delivered, working on knots and generally easing me into a relaxed state. All in all a pleasant experience and I left feeling quite satisfied.

We have qualified masseuses who will provide you the best massage and service in our shop.


During the massage we use rare jade stones. Jade Stone Massage provides relief to stiff and sore muscles, resulting in the alleviation of common chronic and acute problems. Jade is believed to heal stressed organs and discharge toxins. It slows the process of cell aging and strengthens the body’s natural defences and healing power. The soothing green color of jade helps the body to self-heal.

This is not a proper review as such, because I didn't actually go through with a massage here. 

Following up on the leads in this forum, I traversed Southport today before heading back to more familar Surfers Paradise. 

This place caught my eye... although it's pissing distance from the cop shop. I went in and a really tired old (and I think toothless) asian woman was there. She told me some prices, but frankly I was more concerned in a hasty retreat. 

I asked if she did the massage... hoping like hell she was just the MAdam out the front, and a flock of heavenly angels were behind the curtain. But Alas, she said she did the massages. That was enough to have me running like a scared schoolboy into the street.

Anyone tried this place???

Is this address correct? Google indicates it is a sign shop.

I just checked Google... The address is absolutely correct... it is now a massage joint. By the looks of Google it used to be a sign shop. It is next door to a Diving Shop.

Anyone game to try it out????  wait til you see the old dragon... you'll be running all the way to Pacific Fair!!!!!!

I saw this place last week.  I had some time to kill and it got me interested but I was a little put off by how close it was to the cop shop so gave it a miss.

There is a reason this shop may appear not to be 104 Scarborough Street Southport and that is because it isn't.

It is in fact 104A Scarborough Street Southport. The Phone number is 5679 1351 her name is Ling Wei.

Perhaps the mods should adjust the address so it is correctly ascribed. I picked up a flyer on the outside of the shop.

Shop is open seven days. A couple of doors down from and the same side as Southport Police Station.
And yes the Old CML is really hideous. I couldn't bring myself to enter the shop but I rang and asked about the massage. Yes you can get a tug but you would have to kill yourself after as you would not be able to live with the thought of it afterwards. 

There are other massage shops around but Southport lives up to its reputation of being a risky place to frequent.

Biggus.

Person's Name : Not sure

Establishment : Ling Wei Chinese Massage,104A Scarborough St. Southport Gold Coast

Date of Visit : 4/06/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business : Mon-Sat 9am -8pm  Sun 11am-8pm
Rates : $35/1/2hr $60/hr

Age : early to mid 60's

Size/shape : overweight, slobby looking, walks with a limp

Nationality or Ethnicity : mc

Services Provided : massage with hj

Value for money/recommend? : terrible

My experience/comments : Thought I would try this place as it's not far from my place and the rates are not to bad but doubted it would be any good looking at the old woman working there.  She's very plain almost ugly and was busy eating something from a bowl when I walked in.  As soon as I walked in she started raving on about she is a doctor in china and taught massage and knows how to fix any problem u might have..  sounded like a full blown nutter but I was there already so went with her to the massage room and undressed and put my things into a plastic tub next to the table.  
The place smells of old rancid oil and dirty feet.  The towels even smelled worse and doubted they had ever been changed or even aired once in the whole time she's had the shop and this is typical of any shop run by mainland chinese but thought I'd at least get a good massage after the lecture she gave me about how good she was.  The massage was weak and predicable and a little pressing here and there, hopeless really.  She rubbed a bit of oil over me but didn't go anywhere near between my legs.  She did agree to giving me a hj included for $35 and gestured with her hand about wanting hj or not and said it would be $50 and I told her it was too much, because if I was going to be charged $50 I would go around the corner and see Angel or one of her girls, so she agreed to $35 with hj.  I think she's knows where her competition is.
Anyway, finally turned over and she started putting a glove on! and then proceeded with the hj..  I thought this is crazy, a glove to give a hj.  She keeps her other hand behind her back.  I told her to squeeze my balls as she jerked me off, which was very poorly done, but she refused and gave me another crazy story that a stingray had spiked her hand on the weekend and it was sore.   So i just tried to fantasize and think of licking out Angel as she continued with the hj.  Finally got there and she cleaned me up with some tissues.  She went straight back to her desk and fried rice and mumbled something about 'have a fun day' or something.   
Dont waste yr time at this place..  hopeless.
OH, one other thing.. I got a few crabs on me from the filthy towels!  picked them off and doused them with some lice wash when i got back home.  The place is filthy!

Don't know whether to buy you some glasses (Reading) or give you a Medal for Valour and bravery you certainly need something for TOFTT.

I am sure we could do a quick whip around to buy you a drink or a bottle to remove the memory of that ugly sight. Phew!
All I can say is glad it was you not me.

Biggus.

My experience/comments: I thought I would try this place out due to its proximity to Sunshy massage.  However, this one seems to be strictly legitimate and all "above the belt"  It is a real shame because Bella is one hot chica!  Oh well, it was still nice to have a quality massage from a very pretty girl.

There is not a lot more I can say about this one guys.  It might be worth checking out if you are in the area and actually want a proper massage, as $30 for 30 minutes is about the cheapest I have seen.

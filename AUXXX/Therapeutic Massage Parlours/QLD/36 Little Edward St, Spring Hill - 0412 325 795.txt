Was in Spring Hill, Brisbane last w/e and gave the place near the Spring Hill hotel in upper Edward St. a go.

$70/Hr and saw 3 girls in the waiting room.  Two of them were ok looking but other one was an absolute glamour. (Chinese)

Decided to give it a try but made the fatal mistake of saying it was my first time

Asked for firm which wasn't much chop so reverted to soft which was a tickle-fest but a lot more relaxing then being pushed like bread dough.

A tickle here n there but that was about it. 

No mention of anything either and she was so sweet I wasn't game to ask.

Massage 4/10, looks 9/10, venue 7/10 (Reno Qld'er)

Definitely has a RnT look but am not convinced if it is or isn't

Open until 9:30pm-10pm too which is a little suspicious.......

Will be back next to test the follow-up visit theory.

if you want more details, PM me.

My experience/comments:

I rang this place the other day, but it was hard to lock down what was on offer over the phone, I could just make out something about an oily massage and the prices.  I went in and went out the back with a young good looking asian girl in a top and long pants.  She asked if I wanted hard or soft, I went with hard and the massage was really good, and really oily.  There was no tickle tackle at all, and when I was asked to roll over she worked my thighs, stomach and chest.  Unfortunately my manhood thought I must have been at a more inappropriate massage parlour as it was raring to go as she worked my thighs.  The trouble with this place is that you are separated by curtains, and I could hear a guy next to me, so I couldn't really blurt out that I had a certain muscle in need of urgent relief (it should have been obvious).  Anyway the massage was good solid and cheap, the girl was young and hot (albiet covered up), so I can't complain for $40, except I was extremely frustrated by the end of it.  

I might go back as it was a good massage otherwise I'll make a mental note to ask if the joint actually has walls next time.

My experience/comments: Visited this place & found 2 girls on offer. Both heavily made up but also dressed to the nines. Tables are old and seperated by curtains. No face covers over the holes in the tables. Massage was more like a rub. When I rolled over she continued my front but my boner gave the game away. She smiled at me so I smiled back and gestered at my hard on. She wanted $30 to jack me off. I started at $10 but come up to $20 and asked for her top off. She said $30 for topless. By this time the bartering had turned me off a little, so I settled for the $20. The T was fast and furious and had my load splurting in around 60 seconds. She cleaned me up with a warm towel. Just as I was exiting the cubical she walked in and just refolded the towels I's used... YUK!
As much as a turn off that was, I might revisit just so I can see those great asian titties! Payment was up front but the extra's were paid at the end.

My experience/comments : Visited here again for a change of scenery. Was greeted by a young chinese I assume girl. Spoke good english. Massage was very good, nice and string with plenty of crack, sack and cock play during the massage. On rolling over she was straight onto it, but wanted $10 for the tug. No probs. But wouldn't get her nice puppies out, even after I bumped up the price a couple of times. Tug was good and had me blowing in no time.
The cleanliness of this play still concerns me & just on that fact I dont think I will be going back. I don't think they wash their towels very well.
Yumi said she used to work at Broadbeach as well.

My experience/comments : Visited here on way home from work, closer to home and easier to get to than most places when on my way home.There seemed to be quite a few girls on when I was there. Was greeted by a young I assume chinese girl and led to curtained cubicle. Spoke good english. 
Asked for medium massage. Massage was very poor. Nice enough technique, but no pressure at all. I've had tickles harder. On rolling over she covered everything up, and asked if I was a police man. Ummm, no, does my uniform look like a police uniform??? So no hint of anything more - and usually if thats the case, then the massage is good. Two time loser this day.
Finished massage, got dressed paid and left.
The only saving grace was the the "mammasan" or lady in charge this particular day was SMOKING hot, and was dressed in a fantastically tight top and denim shorty shorts. Would only consider going back if I could have her rub me down - or even up for that matter.

    My experience/comments : I've been here numerous times since my first visit and have found the service enhanced since.  Depending on who you get it can be just massage, I've found the young girl with glasses (looks about 18) and the older girl with glasses (looks maybe late 20's early 30's) are massage only but the hot girl at the counter will come and finish you if needed.  There is another hot girl (not as hot as the counter girl) who might finish you off after you've been in a couple of times (I know it's vague but its the best I can do).  I've been told by one of the girls that you need to ask for a special service as it won't be offered.

It still has just curtains in between so if your put off listening to the guy next to you getting his happy ending it mightn't be the place for you.

Anway in summary glasses = not a fully happy service (maybe it's a secret code that I've cracked)

I tried this place once on the way back from the airport, was easily the worst massage shop I've been to.  Yes, just curtains so u can hear the other punters moaning and groaning next to u.  I was greated by a good looking chinese girl at the counter and shown the girl who would massage me.. a bespectacled young asian girl who grinned inanely at me. Was taken to the massage cubicle and stripped off and lay down on a very old table with cracked upholstery and a thin towl.. really rough place.
The young lady came back and started to rub oil into me and was just the most hopeless massage I've ever had and wont come anywhere near yr tackle.  I looked at her a few times when I turned over and she was grinning to herself and looking at the wall.. I'm not sure if she's sane.  I asked her to massage my cock and she refused and she went and got some other woman who wanted $30 for that.. I offered her $20 and finally agreed and proceeded to get me off.  Pretty hopeless hj.
I really dont recommend this place at all.  Better value elsewhere.

My experience/comments : decent massage actually, but no sign initially of extras even though the place has that vibe.  she had glasses and short-shorts on but the small towel stayed on. had to ask and she fairly reluctantly offered happy ending and didnt actually agree on a definite price, seemed a bit awkward.  gave her an extra $40 in the end.  no offers of other stuff. most of the cubicles seperated by curtains so not sure how much goes on. seemed fairly clean

My experience/comments : went back.  got CC.  seemed friendly.  also not a bad massage. suggestive touching started about half-way through which was nice, then towel off!. negotiated happy ending and nude for $100 extra, yes its a lot but i wasnt complaining and she was a good natured girl, friendly etc with a nice bod. got me off but wasnt overly erotic if you follow me. again the place seemed fairly clean, bit dusty but not smelly, hilarious 90s ballad music playing, curtains seperate the cubicals.  may go back but it aint thailand and seems kinda expensive to me

went to AUTHENTIC ASIAN MASSAGE today, while waiting for my car to be serviced in palm beach. got there and was greeted by a very attractive young Asian lady behind the counter called yumi (early 20s, 5f8", C+cup boobs, nice slender long legs, smoking hot body!!) So asked for a 65$ 1 hour massage, but she wasn't  free until another 2 hours, but said another girl will be available in 10 minutes. so decided on the other girl at 40$ for 30mins and maybe 1 hour if shes good. on walking to the massage room, I noticed there was a STRIPPERS POLE  set up at the back of the shop, like lol wtf is a stripper pole doing in a massage shop,but could be a good thing.
anyway got naked and waited for about 15 minutes for Ring (25,5F1",B cup),or I think that's what her name was, her English wasn't that good, the massage was ok ,firm and quite hard for such a small girl,i asked her whats with the strippers pole, but all she said was "exercise" "very good'' "teaching pole dance"... I don't thing she understood what I was saying.Anyway back to the massage after 30mins it was time to turn over ,laid there naked with her smiling and looking at my cock , but she wanted another 40$  for 30mins,so that's like 80$ for 1 hour when it should be 65$ hour.so nah shes not worth that much. so I left and will be booking yumi next time )
Has anyone else seen the strippers pole there before and know if they do shows or anything, I would love to get a lapdance from yumi, she has a  better body than most of the girls at the stripclubs.)

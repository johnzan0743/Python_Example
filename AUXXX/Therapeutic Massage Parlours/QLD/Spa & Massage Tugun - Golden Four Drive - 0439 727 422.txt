Drove past and seen this joint, recognised it from the raids in the gold coast bulletein so decided to give it a whirl, went in paid the normal going rate of $60, average sort of place on the inside masman showed me to a room as to which she asked me to get naked and then told me she had the 'perfect girl' for me, about 10 minutes later a girl walked in wearing sexy short shorts and a bikini top on haha? i turned around and laid down for a back massage, she gave a medium massage as i didnt ask i wanted to see how she would take this one and im glad i did, anyways massage progresses she put her knees in my back and walked on me which i found very good! when she hopped down she started rubbing her tits on my back, which instantly got me hard, she then got off and told me to turn over and asked if i like anything special? i said like what, she grabbed my hand and moved it to undo the string for her bikini and said $50 plus 'make you happy' i agreed, she then proceeded to get naked down to her undies, which were matching her bikini top, she then grasped my cock both with her hands and mouth and let me touch here and there. grabbed her cunt as to which she then backed off and come back sucking me harder to my qlimax, she told me to come back if i want more then rushed out the room with a hand full of cum.

Thank you tugboat for the review on this place. I have a holiday apartment just down the road from this place and have often walked past it, thinking what pleasures could be had in there. I remember talking to one of the locals last time I was there and he was complaining as to how the little centre had deteriorated now that a massage parlour and a tattoo parlour had opened up. I must admit that being in such an exposed location, right on the main road and the entrance visible to all, whether it does attract many customers. Also, it seems to close by 6.00pm. Must find a way in next time I'm up there.

Expierence:
Had visited this place 2 times previously and both times asked to come back as they were busy & both times by same girl who I saw today.
On entering the room I spied the box of tissues and thought it was a sure thing.

Nuded up and layed down. Massage was mediocore. She completed the massage not asking for the flip. On rolling on my side I motioned to old mate who was half mast and she refused.

So I got dressed and left.

Not sure if this girl is running the place now, but she is the same one that has asked me to come back two time previously and that was over the last 2 months so she seems to be a regular there.

The place is very public with the fish n chip shop next door so lots of eyes on those entering and leaving.

Value for money/recommend? : Not really

My experience/comments : I was with the family on a recent trip to the Gold Coast.  The ball and chain was no use to me and I had a serious set of blue balls that needed getting over.  So, venturing out one night alone, I walked around looking for a massage palour that could also relieve the tension.

Stumbled across Studio 14 in the back of the mall.  Standard AMP setup, cheap signage etc.  Decided to walk in and I guess to the lateness of the visit, there was only the one girl working.  Young, medium build and reasonable attractive, so asked for a 1 hr massage.

The whole shop seemed to be curtained off with bed sheets, and was shown a cubicle to disrobe and climb on.  She left me to it, and came back 3 -4 mins later.

Massage was ok, reasonable pressure, however on the flip, she held the towel up and over the area that needed attention the most.  Not a good sign.  Anyhow, proceeded to continue the massage as little me was really straining for attention under the towel.  Got to the end of the massage and was told that it was the finish.  I questioned whether there was any special massage services on offer.  Told no, and was shown a toy (fake pussy) for a little DIY action.  Well I never have used one of those things to date, and I wasn't about to start now.  Told her that if she provided the RnT, I would pay extra.  Eventually agreed on $50 for a HJ, however wasn't allowed to touch even with the clothes on.

Not bad action, although required coaching at times.  Makes me think that this might not have been a regular activity for her.  With the thought of 'breaking in' a newbie, and her actions, I eventually came.  She cleaned me up, and I paid and left.

Overall not worth the $50, however had the result of lightening the load so to speak.

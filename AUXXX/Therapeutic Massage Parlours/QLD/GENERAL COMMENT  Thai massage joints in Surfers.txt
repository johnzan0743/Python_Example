 GENERAL COMMENT  Thai massage joints in Surfers
				
Post Content: 
Well If you look in my reviews you will notice I have done the rounds of the Thai Massage joints in Surfers. That is 

Sabai Thai Massage, Asian arcade (3 visits)
Thai Herbal MAssage, Renaissance Centre (2 visits)
The Thai MAssage Centre, Surfers Paradise Boulevard (2 visits)
Thai Massage and Beauty, Surfers Paradise Boulevrad, opp Trickett St (1 visit)

You can read my reviews in the forums, But I can safely say that none of them offer any extras... all just straight massage. So if you want more... go elsewhere.

Makes me wonder what is going on... The only RnT places seem to be just the Chinese ones with names that contains words like "Gold, Healthy, Happy, Dragon  etc etc) 

I was really hoping one of there Thai places might be an extras joint, as to be honest, I'm bored already with the Chinese RnT places... too predictable.. It takes the fun out of punting coz you know what the result is going to be every time... 

I have an addiction to massage parlours... so If anyone suggests massage joints within 5km of surfers, (I always carry out my missions on foot... much easier to avoid detection)  tell me where it is, and I am more than happy to go check it out.

I admire your tenacity and persistence Mr Jones, so for what it is worth, your undies may be the problem, but it does depend on the girl (some girls do, some girls don't...)

I have it on reliable authority that the massage girls have been told they are not to offer extras to any guy wearing undies and for any new client they should ask the client to keep their undies on (in a loud voice!)  The argument goes that any client could be a cop, but if they are on duty, they must not be naked (not sure about the legality of this argument) however, I would imagine that it does not look good for the investigating officer in court.  Imagine when he is crossed examined about his nakedness and his impotent dick or otherwise while on duty.  Further, the girls should not speak about extras to clients, but instead give hand signals (so their voice cannot be recorded on an audio device, plus a hidden video camera would not be in the best interests of the Cop (if naked) featuring in his own soft porn)

Rumour has it that a number of suspected illegal brothels and massage parlours in and around Surfers over the Gold Coast 600 weekend were targetted, and 2 silly girls at the chinese Chevron island massage venue asked their respective clients (who were wearing undies) if they wanted extras.  These clients were undercover cops who covertly recorded the conversion and charges are currently being heard in the Southport court.  

My suggested technique is to go to these places wearing boardies (no undies), play deaf if they tell you to keep your undies on,  (I know it won't work at the Herbal massage place as they will give you shorts to wear), give hand signals and then see what eventuates.

Good luck with your mission.

Well they clearly told me to leave my underwear on... So I did. If they said nothing I would take everything off... but seems a bit silly if they already say leave them on and then ignore them! haha  Oh well... I still think there is something more to that place... The amount of touching is the most I have experienced anywhere, except for the outright RnT places. So I keep thinking along your comment maybe I look like an undercover cop or something...

The board shorts idea might work... although it would be a shit massage if they made me keep them on. 

This is not over... I will go back again!!!!!

You've sparked my interest too.  We should all hit this place and see who can be the first to get a tug there!  My money's on RJ unless he makes good on the boycot threat.

From what you have been reporting RJ, it sounds like a waste of a further $50.

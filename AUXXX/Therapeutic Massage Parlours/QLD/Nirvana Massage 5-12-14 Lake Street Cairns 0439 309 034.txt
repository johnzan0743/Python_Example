I was in Cairns for the day and went to Conservatory Building in Lake Street to seek out Helens Massage shop, which had a good AUXXX RnT review.   Unfortunately I didn’t have the exact details with me and spotted Nirvana Massage in that shopping arcade.    I now realise Nirvana is shop 5, Helens is shop 13.    

So - TOFTT at Nirvanas.

My experience/comments : 

Called in at opening time and was taken to a nice clean fully enclosed room.   Signed up for 30 minutes.    Was asked to undress and leave undies on.     I took undies off and covered myself with a towel, hoping for other possibilities.    Upon her return said I preferred undies off, she had no issues with that.

An excellent massage of back and the higher parts of my butt followed.    Absolutely no TT or anything approaching sensual.     I realised I had come to the wrong place.   Ah well, that’s punting.

A local might add whether Helen's massage is still there.      I did not see it.

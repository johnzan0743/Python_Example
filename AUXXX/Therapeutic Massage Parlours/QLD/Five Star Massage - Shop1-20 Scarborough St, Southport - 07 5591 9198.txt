Ventured out for my second punt for 2014. As has been my habit lately I started off with a 1 hr massage at Nucys,($45: today I saw a ML named Jenny,(Nucy is still on Hols' in Thailand, back on 26Th.) Once again only legit available here but for a genuine massage I would highly recommend (Nucy & Jenny in particular).Anyhow this set the tone for what I was really craving . So after trying unsuccessfully trying a private Asian lady in Helensvale(tried for about 1and 1/2 Hrs )I shifted my attention to the above establishment, I have had them on my to do list for a little while now; I think they have only been operating for a couple of months, maybe 3 or so. Anyway entered and was greeted by a slim fairly attractive young lady ( looked Korean) and was quoted the above prices; as it was my first time there I opted for the 45min option. Was taken to the room(The very 1st one close to reception).The rooms are smallish with walls that end about 600mm short of the celling, also the door was a sliding affair which missed the floor by about 150mm (maybe this is because there's no aircon,or at least it wasn't on: you know, let the air circulate a bit) anyway  was told to undress and mount the table, waited about 3 mins and in came Elly(not the girl from reception)I thought no big deal, as she was attractive in a strange sort of way, certainly not fugly, her English is very,very good,could almost have been born here, or at least spent most of her life in an English speaking country. So, on to the massage etc itself, she asked me how I would like it, I asked for med/soft: after all I wasn't there for the therapeutic benefits of the massage: I had just come from Nucys, I have to say had I been there for the massage I would have been somewhat disappointed, even given it was a soft massage it was somewhat repetitive and became a bit boring,even the tickle was much the same; it didn't have a particularly erotic effect on me, just a lot of tickling around the tackle which went on for what seemed like 15mins or so. When the turn was affected she indicated HJ (by hand signals)and put up 2 fingers to indicate $20; to be honest I wasn't all that turned on so said no, she then offered nude HJ for $50,once again I declined. She continued with the massage,with a little teasing thrown into the mix and kept putting the question to me with the price coming down all the time. Eventually I weakened and said yes to a topless HJ for $20; I'm glad I did, her boobs whilst only being about size 'b' are beautiful to behold (and to hold ). 
Her HJ was interesting to say the least, she had a technique which saw her hand pointing down the shaft and did the deed with a twisting motion,all the while rocking her pelvis back and forth ( on my hand ). It only took about 3 mins for the inevitable result.(very satisfying, I'm glad I relented in the end  ). By the way she didn't seem to mind touching through knickerers. As I was rubbing her pussy I could feel a panty liner in place, so maybe bad timing otherwise may have been able to get inside. Anyway all in all not a bad experience or a waste of time, but, as I said YMMV. I don't think any extras: ie FS, would be on offer given the configuration of the rooms. Also I was sushed every time I tried to speak, even in a whisper, most communication was done via hand signals and mouth to ear.
Would I return? yes, but would see someone else, but would see Elly again if no one else available, as she is a pleasant girl.
By the by, when I rang yesterday I was told there was 5 girls working, I only saw Elly and the receptionist. Although I did hear more talking while I was there.

Have had a very similar experience with Elly. Pleasant 24 yo average massage, same hand job twist with touching seemed to be ok. Engwish very good. Other visit here was with Tina much better technique allround but no engwish and no touching so overall no as enjoyable.
For your info.

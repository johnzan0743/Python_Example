Ok. I cocked up there. hit the wrong key by mistake. 
As I was about to say; I called this place a week or more ago but they were busy and I couldn't get in at a time that suited me. Any was out for another punt last Friday so gave them another try; made a booking and fronted up at the arranged time. When I walked in the first thing I noticed was the massage areas  were only curtained off areas. When I entered said room? I was surprised to note the curtains were some sort of sheer material and you could out through themAlso the area was ultra narrow; there was only about 300-400mm either side of the table(on one side was a wall on the other was the curtain dividing my room from the one beside). Her arse would have to have been encroaching into the next cubicle when she was on that side. Anyway, on with the massage. Nuded up and onto the table; she entered and covered me with a towel and started. The first 10 mins or so was taken up with her squeezing and kneading my body from neck to ankle. When the massage started she folded the towel down to get to the areas she was working on. the massage itself wasn't too bad at all. This went on for quite a while and I was asked to turn over.She held the towel up so I was completely hidden from her gaze, she then covered me from neck to ankle  with said towel. she started to perform stretching manoeuvres on my legs and inner thighs(this got a little painful at times) to my surprise when she had finished ( after about 3-5 mins) she informed me we were finished and left me to get dressed. I checked my watch and noted that she did indeed use the whole hour. Was offered water or ginger tea and a lolly(which I declined). I was then on my way..With a full load on board I headed off to find somewhere else to relieve my frustration. This will be the subject of another post at another time...

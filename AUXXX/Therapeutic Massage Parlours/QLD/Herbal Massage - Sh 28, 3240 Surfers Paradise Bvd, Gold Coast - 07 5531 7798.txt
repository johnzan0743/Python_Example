My experience/comments : 

Ok, Firstly.... This place is completely Legitimate. Well.. this is my view on first visit. I say this because money is a powerful negotiating tool.. Just as aside.. in a completely legitinmate massage therapy place in Brisbane (apologies, I can't remember the name, but it's around Carina area I think) I managed to get a gorgeous asian girl to massage me topless for an extra $100... Now I know that is the price of FS here in GC, but Mr Jones Jr wanted to see those titties, and lucklily Mr Jones Sr has the ability to afford such frivolous wanton excesses.

Back to Thai Herbal Massage.It has an upmarket appearance, and the massage rooms are clean, and towels and mattress covers clean and fresh. The massage was really great. It was very thorough, and covered the whole body except for the tackle department and stomach area. Which was lucky for the lovely little masseuse, becasue her relaxining "medium" pressure massage had Jones Jr twitching. I had a completely relaxing hour, and it was great to just crash out and leave the outside world behind. I will definitely go back when I need this type of massage. And the staff are so friendly. 

But it is not a place for punters.


The staff are very friendly

I used to think the opening hours gave it away as to whether a RnT was on the cards. Eg 9 - Late   Maybe just the girl? Just wondering if you gave her the wink? *VBG*

I have been on a mission for the last week. I have tried this Thai Herbal place, Golden touch, Sabai Thai, and The Thai Massage centre... all 4 are in the heart of Surfers... and all 4 are legit as far as I can tell... They all do 1 hour full body oil for between $45 and $65  so I think that gives tha game away.  All the RnT places are more like $50 for 30 minutes.

And all of the Thai places only have curtains between massage areas, and believe me, when Jones Jr blows his top ... no flimsy curtain will contain the primeval grunting and comotion.

I have tried asking for "extras" at the reception at another massage parlour... only to be met with a dumb look of "I don't what you mean sir"  

ANY PUNTERS OUT THERE OFFER SOME ADVICE FOR GETTING THE MASSAGE GIRL INTO A BIT OF EXTRAS??????

Walk into the joint and at the counter tell the girl that a "friend" of yours said this place does special massage and if they still dont get it do a wanking jesture lol

Might sound silly to use but it will save u the hassle straight up and save cash and it could also reveal that the girl at the counter doesnt but another girl does like the amity thai shop in southport

i sussed out 2 massage places in Aus fair today and both are legit so didn't bother. The one under the post office and the one near the Gym after the lil sky bridge which leads to the movies side of Aus fair.

 Rjones so u saying that THai place on ground level in the asian alley is legit? Full has a sexy sus vibe about it lol THe other place i wanted to sus out was the massage place one street behind billys beach house but there was too many ppl there for me to use my line about the special massage

Keep u guys posted

UPDATE

Ok, went to Sabai Thai Massage again tonight, 14/12/11.

Different masseuse... Ok... before anyone gets too excited... I still think it is legit...and it is an underwear-on place..... BUT... this girl did so many brushes against Jones Jr and the boys that Iwas was sure it was game on. She touched my nutsack several times when massaging the back of my legs. She also touched the end of my knob when doing the pressure point thing around my hips. And plenty of brushes of my knob through the towel on top. When I turned to the front she did the same thing letting her fingers slip inside my undies to brushe against the landing gear. And then she tucked the towel into the top or my underwear to do my stomoch, and managed to get a touch on the shaft of my already rigid pole. It was quite exciting at the time.... BUT nothing else happened.... so kinda frustrating really. I might have one more go...... maybe thay have secret ways of figuring out who is regular or not. Or maybe they think it's funny to get us excited and then send us away???? who knows???

I hope my detective work is being appreciated by you fellow punters!!!  it's starting to become an addiction!!!

Yes mate... you're obviously a man on a mission and it is appreciated.  Also thanks to qwerty for the intel on the 2 Aust. Fair places.  I've been to the one under the post office (legit for me too) but have often wondered about the one near the gym

UPDATE 

Ok, I am on a fools errand..... I went to the Sabai Thai place tonight  for the 3rd time in a week... Same result again.... A great massage with heaps of deliberate brushing of balls and cock... both inside undies (it's an undies on place)  and outside the towels. All done quite innocently during the course of the Thai-style massage. So 3 different girls.... all have same basic techniques... I find it very exciting, but then damn frustrating!!! Tonight The girl actually ran her hand under my undies and touched my shaft.... it must have been on purpose.... 

Tonight I made in quite clear I was excited by her massage, she would have had to be deaf and blind to miss it.... At the end of the massage I asked her plain and simple if she did "special massage" and pointed at my cock. The answer was a flat "NO"  So there you have it punters... It is definitely a legit place..

I think what we have here is a brilliant marketing tool... think about it... every punter that goes there gets the feeling that there might be something more... so they go back again... and again..  each time hoping the different girl might offer more. Even now after 3 visits with only a massage and no extras, I'm thinking of going back for another go... there are the signs there... dimly lit..  a bit out of the way (upstairs) And tonight I turned up just after  9pm... The older lady at the counter suggested that I tip the girl because she would have to work a bit later as they shut at 10pm, and I wanted an hour massage. I thought her suggesting a tip was a hint!  haha

Anyway... I have spent 3 x $55 = $165 there this week, with no result... so if you're after extras save your dosh for somewhere else.... Actually I think I might boycott the place... I hate it when a chick gets me excited and doesn't put out... that goes for massage girls aas well!!!!

I've been there once.  I noticed they stopped advertising in the GCB so went for a drive past one day and thought it looked like they had moved on?  I'll have to go for another look soon, because I thought it was pretty good.  I saw a nice tidy asian girl who gave a pretty good massage and good teasing HJ ending.  She got really close to my knob with her mouth and tits but never all the way.  I thought the room was well presented (stylish modern decor) and clean.

Last time I called they had a few girls on per day and nationalities varied.  I got there just before closing and there was only one girl still working.  Can't remember the street number either. Edit... Look up "Hilldon Ct, Nerang" on Google maps and you'll see the driveway straight away (behind the old cream coloured car).  It's 23 Hilldon Ct and it was right up the back corner of the factory block.

This place sounds amazing. Is the fee just straight $50 or are you actually tipping or something? cheers in advance.

Drove past today and the signs are gone. This place seems to close shop from time to time? Always the same big red signs when they're open though. Oh well... let's hope they open up again soon.

Found ad in the bulletin 
"A new Korean Duo, $90 per hour, full body relax" 

I'm bored with the Happy Dragon chain, so always looking for something new, this ad caught my eye, as it said "duo"... sounded like my thing...

I made appointment and rocked up to Harbourtown, easy to find the place. The front desk girl was friendly, and showed me to a room. They seem to have only private rooms. Was looking promising for a RnT as the room had tissues, and looked the part... I'm always hopeful. I stripped and lay waiting for my two koreans. The premises is very clean and tidy.
Two very nice girls came in... but I was beginning to wonder if this was just a legit place, as they dressed in a uniform, not crazy student clothes like most of the RnT girls around Gold Coast.

One girl asked what I would like.. I said medium. The massage was really good... in fact it was great experience to have four hands all over me... They did a bit of pressure massage with a towel, and then did an oil massage. It was great.. There was no accidental touching or anything remotely sexual unfortunately. I turned over and they placed a towel over me, and did the rest of me. 

Was it worth $90... well IMO yes... it was really nice end to the day.. very friendly girls, great normal massage.. and new experience to have two at once. I would go back next time I feel like a treat, but I doubt any extras would be available here.

Would be interested to hear of any other punters experience here.

I thought this may have been promising because there was that place (private house near the bike shop) straight across the road from Harbour Town advertising duo massages.  It's closed down now I think, so I when I read the thread title I thought maybe they've opened up a new place!  Shame it sounds legit, but it definitely sounds like good value anyway.  I might check it out next time sometime. You never know I suppose... I thought Amity was legit at first and had 2 straight massages before I got a tug... and what are the tissues for - blowing your nose?!?

Yeah, svanoz... I'm a seasoned punter... and those tissues in the room make me suspect something more... plus, also... I think I'm right in saying that every advertiser in the GC bulletin theraputic massage section, so far at least, I have been able to get a tug... except maybe that stupid pink mermaid place. All the others pretend to be legit, but as you say get a tug the second time.. And anyway,  advertising "new korean duo, full body relax" sounds dodgy!!!   it's got to be a RnT right??? haha

I think I will go back, it looks like a RnT in almost every respect, even the at the front they had a little waiting room behind a curtain where the girls hang out while they wait for customers, the private rooms, tissues... and while they were dressed in asian costumes, the girls looked sexy... time will tell, just hope someone else writes a review also...

I gave them a call today and did a bit of fishing... definitely not giving anything away over the phone and didn't even imply anything might be on the cards like some do. You know what I mean... they won't come out and say it but keep saying stuff like "You come in and try... very relaxing, very good massage... you be very happy" that sort of thing. The lady here was quite direct with her answer... "No, straight massage only!"  We all know that isn't necessarily the final answer, so I reckon I'll have to go have a look one day. They have a special $50 for an hour before 11:30am so it's worth a look I reckon.  Now... if only I can pluck up the courage to pitch a tent under the towel when I'm on my back to let them know I'm after more... we need to see what they do when they are working around a hard cock.

its a no go guys went there last night  1 lady behind the counter one pretty little korean on the couch it was 6.30pm and the place is well hidden so i thought it has to be a rub and tug joint. little korean took me to room and left again so i stripped naked face down when she came in room i gave her 50 dollars and said this is a tip for you. she said woaaaa thank you very much booked for 30 minutes and she gave a pretty good massage but just kept rubbing my back and legs seemed like for ever then she bent down to my ear and i thought here we go and she whispered your time is up thank you very much. i said what about the front and she said that is with a hour booking so i said give me another 30 minutes to do front. so i roll over and she puts towel across me gave me good rub on the front and with moving the towel up and down gave me an erection but still no touch from her so i thought i would start touching myself and see what she does. she said no no no stop doing that and pulled my hands away. so i just closed my eyes and waited for the massage to be over.   40 dollars for the first 30 minutes 20 dollars for the next 30 minutes and 50 dollars for the tip at the start. it wont belong before this place will be closed down because normal people wont go there cause it fair dinkum looks like a rub and tug joint i know they pay 2000 a month rent for that place so i m betting they are on a month to month lease they will get in as many blokes as they can because its on the way to bunnings so plenty of men will see it thinking its a new rub and tug make plenty of cash for the first few months then move on to somewhere new and start again and doing this without yanking on someones horny cock.

Yeah, good review kikki... I'm glad you agree it looks like a rub and tug place.... I don't think it will last long. It didn't seem very busy when I went, and again when I went past this week. It's a pity they dont realise they could make a fortune, if hey did extras, because the look and feel of the place way better than most of the other actual rub and tugs places.

I was driving down Brisbane Rd tonight and did a drive by recon look-see.  RJones, I second your gut feeling... this does look like a RnT shop for sure.  It was about 7pm, the whole area is dark, the shopfront itself is very dimly lit, but it has a multi-coloured neon "OPEN" sign in the window.  I can understand a legit massage shop open in the middle of Surfers until 9pm, but in that location, really?

After reading the the article in the GCB about raids I'm wondering if they planned the shop with all "bad" intentions then had to go legit when the heat got turned up?

The way I see it .... Any place that has private rooms with doors, tissue boxes... And located in quiet areas has got to be RnT. Maybe I look like a cop.... I went to Areca in broadbeach ages ago, and I just got a standard massage... But read the gold coast article they have an extensive menu...

Now it appears that "Grace" is advertising in Gumtree a couple of "see pic" French girls who will no doubt tickle your fancy and wallet but it still remains if anything else will get tickled apart from SOH's

Not sure that this is a tease or if the Mamasan is simply clueless         it remains to be seen obviously with a more overt ad campaign or Gumtree suggesting that some other things may be on the menu! Hmmm fairly elaborate for an asian parlour. Do they ? Or don't they? Does it really matter?

link to ad on Gumtree should remaain current until end of May 2013   French Duo Massage - Ooh La La | Health,Sports & Beauty | Gumtree Australia Gold Coast City - Biggera Waters  Good luck if you can work this piece of work out!

This place is a bit hard to gauge.  I popped in just to sus it out one weekend.  I'd been working all day in the yard and had just been to the dump, so I said I just wanted prices "because I was all stinky and sweaty".  The [very hot] girl on the front desk said "oh that doesn't matter... it's VERY sexy".  I declined but said I'd return - which I did.

Went in the next weekend and actually had some manscaping done in the form of a back and shoulder wax (never done it before and probably won't repeat).  Anyway when that was done I said I'd like a 1/2hr massage to help sooth my skin.  I enquired about the duo option but they actually knocked it back saying it would be better when my skin wasn't so tender from the waxing.

Anyway, what followed was a pretty good massage by an immaculately groomed stunner (the girls are gorgeous, and there's something about those colourful asian styled uniforms that adds to their hotness).  The part that I found strange, was after hearing all the reviews saying this place was legit, I got on the table and left my undies on.  The chick came back in and actually said, "do you not want your bum massaged"?  I said "what", and she repeated and patted me on the butt.  So I got up and pulled off the jocks (she actually left the room when I did that).  When the massage was finished she kind of left the room for me to get up, but she definitely stopped to have a look when I rolled over to get off the table.

The girls in this place fuckin hot and the massage I had was very good and relaxing.  It would make a killing if they did extras I reckon.

Could also be that they only offer extras for Korean customers. Koreans don't talk to authorities and having Korean girls available will ensure a steady stream of Korean male clients. If we have any Korean members here, they might be able to check.

I would doubt that would be the case. If it were the case they would not be posting lame ads on Gumtree in Engrish. There are a number of places that are open that are just confusing how they pay the rent let alone make any money over that. If a place does extras they do it for everyone after vetting is the rule. Some places are straight legit but usually only have a one out worker. If they have a dedicated receptionist this is almost a guarantee they do extras. The Korean Tourists are usually travelling with family so no go there. Businessmen won't visit a parlour because they don't have to. They order take out if they need it in the comfort of their Hotel room. Besides fellas do you really think that they come here to sample their own?

My guess is there is something else going on here like a laundry. In with the dirty money out with the clean. Keystone coppers Queensland style are too busy being stooges to solve any real crime.
There are a number of places owned by the Yakuza on the Gold Coast they are just offshoring money exchanges. Face it The National Blame Authority is way too busy busting sportslovers dreams to pick up on obvious os crime gangs creating wealth at our expense.

This is the latest ad offered by this outfit.

As the nervous system is symettrical you get the same pain signal from each side of your body, so in a traditional massage style as the therapist works on soothing one side, you still feel the aches and pain in the other side. However, the duo massage relieves the aches and pains on both sides of the body, so that you can completely relax.

You will note that this outfit are untruthful. They advertise European girls but have none working.
They have some Korean and Chinese girls but they are not desperate for money and are paid for attendance.
The "so called" legit places aren't. But it is not because they are offering extras or sexual services for us poor punters. More likely you can use a bit of imagination and draw your own conclusion.
They are not busy. They pay rent. They pay the poor Engrish speaking girls to attend the premises.
They are not open long hours. They see very few clients. 
If they were legit or even illegit offering extra services they would be busier. But they are not.
The conclusion is this place laundry.

Possibly you are right about it being a money laundering scheme, but you're dead wrong about Korean men not wanting Korean girls in Australia. There are heaps of Koreans  living on the Gold Coast and they hold Korean women at a much higher standard and quality than they do other Asians. The few Korean sexual massage places I've been to in Sydney (which has an even larger contingent of Korean immigrants) are over $180+ for the hour.

Maybe you would be right if indeed they were busy with Koreans patronising this shop. Problem is the shop is never busy. So if they have Korean customers they are invisible. The roster is BS and everything else points to the fact that there is something else going on. This business is out in the open has an indiscreet entrance and the shop does not open hours that allow entry in the dark of the night. So your theory about Koreans getting treatments of any kind holds no water let alone some secret handshake signifying extras to be available only to korean customers. Besides the facts show otherwise. Most Japanese girls speak Engrish and their native tongue along with perhaps a smattering of Mandarin but rarely Korean. Whilst this is not always the case the facts are the shops are manned with mostly Jap and the odd Chinese girls only. So that blows the Korean theory right out of the water. They are not doing extras because if they did that would make the shop busy and bring way too much attention to themselves. Upon further investigation the intel provided that they have no Korean massage therapists working in the shop and if you attend and ask they say not to next week. other girl she see you now. So what i posted above proved to be misleading as there are no Koreans working in the shop or if there are they do not work everyday or anyday i have mede an enquiry about the roster. 

You need to think about things before you suggest that non existant Korean Masseuses are giving extras only to Korean customers of whom there aren't any. The hypothesis is its a laundry designed to turn over money. It has been in common use in Sydney for a long time. It is just offshoring proceeds of crime. the only thing sinister apart from the business is the roster of non existant Euro gals and extensive rosters. These guys pay the girls to attend. the books are cooked and they probably even pay taxes. It is still dubious as to whether or not there is any other purpose for a massage shop which has very few clients can remain in business considering the high rents on the premises. Remember Asians are not stupid business people. But they are open to other means of processing proceeds from illegal or illicit earnings and what better way to do this than through a cash business. You only need to know how quiet their business is to realise that it simply does not support a normal business model. There are many more massage businesess including RnT parlours who cannot sustain their rents let alone expand and open more shops. Japs are not stupid. However the thing they don't need is for Council to bring a prosecution against them for operating outside of their licenses and D.A.'s Hence no nordy rubs happening here at all nothing to see move along now...


Incidentally i am not suggesting anything about Korean preferences save for the obvious. Chequers sauna in Goulburn Street in Sydney was saved from bankruptcy many years ago now by the introduction of Korean girls doing Korean style massage a euphemism for nude RnT but they prefer Caucs to Korean men because some Korean men treat them like krap!
Btw Korean girls give great massage and are far superior in skills to most MLC. They are also less mercinary.
The above is merely an opinion of what is going on and is not designed for any evidential material  or any basis for an investigation merely information for the benefit of members of the forum so as they don't waste too much time and less money on these sham shops.

Hello fellow punters, recently called in (May) after reading the tread on this place.
Paid $70 for the hour
Had Chinese lady Jenny perform the massage.
Asked to enter the room after paying, which looking a respectful place and clean. Striped down, jumped on the table. The massage was good all over, if your into massages only. I asked for particular attention to my upper leg areas and stomach for when I turned over. 
Basically all I received was genuine massage, it was good, but disappointing on the final outcome, as hoped a crack in the armour may have appeared after so many rejections expressed in the thread. When I was rolled over I attempted several times for a result of some slap and tickle and hint of extra activities on offer...No.  I advised the towel could be removed, just received a funny little laugh. I had cream applied over the body as well as I asked fro exfoliation with the massage. I had a raising concern under the towel and asked if the cream could assist in the area. I got smile and a click of the fingers and she said, what do you say, dam...sorry don't do.

Massage good, service good, people very friendly,if that's what your after.

 that Ferry Sorry punters, still looks like this joint has not been cracked. I have also learnt that 278 Ferry road is also owned by the owner of this place....Not sure if that is any less stringent on its offerings

Have it on excellent authority now that both these parlours Ferry Road and Gateway Harbourtown are cash washing carwashes and laundrys. 

A suggestion is if you want your happy snapped faces going into a rather large dossier then by all means continue patronising these two places. 

DO NOT PARK ANYWHERE NEAR THEM as your plates will be recorded and your identity noted or the reg owner of the transport you are using id will be recorded.

Sorry cannot make these points any more simpler than that. Don't ask Won't tell policy is in force for this INTEL.

Fellas the numbers of shops opening is diluting the few punters around if indeed you keep giving your hard earned to these so called "Legit" shops! 
The reason these reviews need to be read and heeded is if all the shops that offer extras go to the wall through lack of patronage due to punters trying to crack Fort Knox Bullion safes open then the few decent punts that are currently available will disappear faster than you can say Erection!

Remember punt with your heads not over them! 

Oh and gamble responsibly!

My experience/comments :

After my quick FS visit to Yoko I felt like slowing the pace down with a nice legit relaxation massage to unwind for the week.  Knowing nobody on this forum has reported success with extras at this place, I thought it was a sure bet to have no temptations offered.  I actually left my undies on, to make it clear I wasn't after an hanky panky.

Not much to say really, but I had a very nice, relaxing massage performed by an attractive, and friendly mature lady.  She sounded Japanese to me, and her name kinda supports that.  Would've liked the head massage to last a bit longer, but overall the massage was very nice.

Still a fully legit place as far as I can tell.

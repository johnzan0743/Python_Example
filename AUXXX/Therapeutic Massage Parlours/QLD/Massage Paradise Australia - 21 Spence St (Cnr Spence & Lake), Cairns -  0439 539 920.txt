Person's Name : Abby

Establishment : Massage Paradise Australia

Date of Visit : 12 May 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 21 Spence Street (corner of Spence & Lake Streets). 0439 539 920. Massage Paradise Australia

Hours of Business : 10am-10pm

Rates : $67 for 1hour (they take cash or eftpos but no credit cards)

Age : Around 25 would be my guess

Size/shape : Size 10, very well padded but not fat, blonde.  

Nationality or Ethnicity : UK Caucasian

Services Provided : Massage plus HJ available

Value for money/recommend? : Not really

My experience/comments : New place opened in Cairns in the cbd. Entrance fairly bold and obvious and not all that discreet. Fairly blatant in their offering of a rnt. When I phoned to book I was asked directly if I wanted 'extras'. So I said sure. The detail of what 'extras' might be available wasn't discussed. When I arrived was asked what kind of massage I would like. It was pointed out to me that they also offer a "sensual exotic massage". This is on a semi-hidden sign board after you come in the main entrance. Its also detailed in the web link given above. It involves no more than a topless and a G-string and the prices seem totally crazy (ie $159+ for 1 hour)!! I said no and that I'd just like a regular therapeutic massage. Was led to the room by the girl and she then left while I got undressed. She returned and went to put a towel over my bum but I said no need. What commenced was a very limp and lame massage. This girl was clearly a novice at best! Absolutely no sensual brushes or tackle tickle let alone any real massage skills. Asked to flip after 30 mins. Decided to get things moving and asked for a HJ. The response was $60! I countered at $30. She then countered at $50. I then offered $40 but she still said no. She wasn't all that hot to look at and $50 still seemed too much to me so I declined. I then attempted to do some DIY and she told me no! That was it for me... lame massage, stupid haggling for a HJ, not so cute girl and then no DIY, so I thought this is enough. I said firmly (but politely) to the girl that I'll make it 30min and finish now and that I'd like a refund. She looked a bit surprised but after her initial hesitation said, "ok, sure". Not a good experience but I guess the shop is only new. However I won't be back until that take on some Asian girls. At the moment all the girls are Caucasian. No Aussies. All on holidays visas and from the UK, Ireland and France. This place isn't really hiding what's available and I wonder where they sit re Qld laws.

To sum up... crap massage and no Asian girls available. A disapointment

Person's Name : Gina

Establishment : Massage Paradise Australia

Date of Visit : 22 August 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 21 Spence Street (corner of Spence & Lake Streets). 0439 539 920. Massage Paradise Australia - Massage Paradise Australia

Hours of Business : 10am-10pm 

Rates : $67 for 60mins 

Age : 25

Size/shape : Size 10, c cups, 160cm. Pretty and sexy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean

Services Provided : Massage plus HJ 

Value for money/recommend? : Definitely!!

My experience/comments : Had some time to kill so decided to give this place another try and was very pleasantly surprised... I opted for the 'basic' 60 min massage at $67. Gina was on reception and was quite attractive. I confirmed that she would be doing the massage before handing over my cash. She then took me to the room and left me to undress. On her return she didn't cover me with a towel and commenced a very decent massage with plenty of subtle sensual strokes and brushes, which is just what I like. I told her the massage was great and that her touch was magic and did a few moans as she brushed the right places. She quickly realised that I liked what she was doing and upped the tempo with plenty of strokes of my crack and brushes of my shaft. On the flip things got even better and she worked her hands very close to my erect shaft... next thing, without me even asking and with no mention of extras or cash, she took my shaft in her hands and started to give me a very slow and sensual hand job. She gave plenty of eye contact and smiles as she worked me well and enjoyed what she was doing. She took her time and worked me to a great climax. In all I had three visits with Gina and each session got better. Though on the third visit Gina told me that she was leaving for Perth so I haven't been able to see her again 

All up I think this shop is worth a visit.... Just be aware that it seems some of the girls will but others won't (in terms of the 'basic' $67 for 60min or $37 for 30min massage). So you may or may not get lucky (Cairns is not like Sydney or Melbourne where at the right shop a tug and perhaps more is a sure bet). As always its a case of ymmv... Or you can simply pick the erotic massage (apparently only one or two of the girls do that). But that is ridiculously overpriced for my liking.

Person's Name : Kozu

Establishment : Massage Paradise Australia

Date of Visit : 27 November 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 21 Spence Street (corner of Spence & Lake Streets). 0422 638 553 or 0439 539 920. Massage Paradise Australia - Massage Paradise Australia

Hours of Business : 10am to 10pm 

Rates : $37 for 30mins or $67 for 60mins. The price board has various options and is a bit confusing. They tried to upsell but I went with the standard 60min Swedish massage.

Age : 25-30

Size/shape : Slim and petite. Size 8. Attractive 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

Services Provided : Therapeutic massage only

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : This place seems a bit hit and miss, depending on who you get. Mostly European girls working here. They will possibly try to upsell at the front desk, offering a bikini or topless massage for quite a bit more (I don't recall the exact prices). But it's simply that - bikini or topless and nothing more. My preference is to pay for the basic massage and then carefully test the water in the room with the girl to see what else might be on offer. After success from some earlier visits I decided to give this place another try. Walked in and Kozu was on reception. She was cute looking and when I checked if she was free for a massage she said yes. I then paid my money and was taken to the room. She gave the dreaded "please leave your underpants on" instruction and I though damn! But I think to myself, what the heck, I'll take my underpants off and see what happens. She returns to the room and there's no reaction to my naked ass apart from covering it with a towel. She then commenced a pretty good massage. Unfortunately no sensual strokes or light brushes. She kept well away from any sensitive areas. After about 15mins I decide to test the water and quietly ask if she'll make the massage sensual for some extra cash. She gave a firm but polite no, saying "I don't do that, sorry". So all up a decent massage but a disappointing punt.

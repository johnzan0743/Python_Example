Establishment : Green Tea Massage

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 655 Toohey Road, Salisbury

Hours of Business: 9 to 10pm

Rates: $40 / 30 mins

Age: early 20s

Size/shape: Size 6, not slim but got a real nice figure with curves; B cup probably

Nationality or Ethnicity: Korean

Services Provided: Massage + "therapeutic" rub

Value for money/recommend?: 10/10 and YES

My experience/comments: First time at GTM because I live in the northside and usually just go to QJ for my needs. But had to make a trip around the area today and figured to give this place a try. Really nice establishment, super clean and well decorated. Sophia took care of me and gave me the most unreal massage I've ever had. She'd climb onto the table and use her knees, then hang on to the ceiling rails for a back walk. My tired old joints and back felt so awesome. Months of tension and bad posture were cracked away. I opted for the hard massage and it was perfect (a bit too hard in the lower back area, but didn't complain because I was in heaven). She definitely doesn't look like those Korean pop stars, but the more I looked at her, the prettier she got. Did the flip, got the frontal massage, and a "therapeutic" rub. I'm addicted now and will be going back again later this week. Extras are negotiated with the girl, but since she did such a fantastic job, I didn't mind giving her a bit extra. God I wish GTM had a shop in the northside

Did you have to ask for the RNT or tip or anything? I went to the Green Tea at 2908 Logan Rd, Underwood once ages back, and the girl I had back then rejected any chance of a RNT.

Value for money/recommend?: ummm.. this place weirds me out

My experience/comments: So I decided to check this place out after ITRfaithful's recommendation. The other GMT shop is a no-no for happy endings as far as I have been able to tell, so I wanted to work this out. This shop has identical signage, layout and all. But the rooms are darker. Dark rooms with funky blue lights, instead of the bright light of the underwood shop. Beds are the same (and no change of towels as per the trend lately). So I ask this girl for a soft massage. She does give a soft massage, almost could be sexual, but not quite. That kind that makes me think "ahh shit, this isn't one of those places, there goes $40". Anyway, I ask to turn over, as it's well past half-time and it's obvious she's not doing it. But I want to make sure. So I get her rubbing, and ask her to start rubbing where I'm pointing (for 10 points, any guesses where I was pointing?). She doesn't at first. But she doesn't say anything. After like 10 seconds she lightly touches around it with the back of her hand. I seriously have no idea what the f*** is going on. Sorry for the language folks. I'm a calm man, but this place is freaking me out, because I can't tell if it's "on" or "off". She touches a little, then goes back to her full leg rub (again, not quite sexual, but she does go all the way up the leg close to the package). I ask her to get some more oil and put it on my cock. She does. She then starts an on-again, off-again hj. It seems she doesn't really have any skill in this area. I really wonder what goes on in this shop. Yet she's doing it, and she's not asking for tips. I check with her after to see if she wants tips in a round-about way, as I don't want to up the prices, but at the same time I want to know if this is normal or not. She doesn't say much.

Anyway, I get close to finishing, she does rub harder so she's somewhat in tune with what's going on and what I need. I finish up, she asks if I want a shower or wet towel (they have showers.. good to know). I opt for the wet towel and get out of there.

This place is not too far from QE2 hospital, but it feels like it's in the middle of nowhere. Being next to a state forest or whatever, it's no where near civilisation. 

If anyone else has some insights into what exactly goes down at this place, I'd love to know. At the moment it's messing with my head, and I don't particularly want to go back (firstly, because it's *far*, secondly, because it's "weird").

p.s. The phone number provided originally in this topic was disconnected. The phone number on the shop signage is 0423 720 210 .

My experience/comments: Other punters have reported good things about this place but from the moment I walked in the door I had the feeling it was a let down, and it was right. Very cold girls on the front desk usher through customers like a butcher sliding meat through a cold room. The friggen blue lights in the room, who the hell thought they were a good idea. Anyhow, I got an ok massage and toweled off at the end but no hint of extras from this lady, didn't like the attitude much so I didn't inquire of the extra, packed myself up and headed to Deshon St where every customers leaves happy.

Yeah I somehow tried this place again, and I hate it. When I asked for a slow massage she did somewhat get the idea, and she got a little slow stroking over my back and shoulders going, but then kept stroking my head which didn't turn me on. But then she offered a minimum $30 tip to touch my tackle, which would make it $70 for 30 mins just to get some touching going, and no guarantee of a finish. This place is crazy. Uncertain offers. I don't recommend.

wow drastically different experiences! i do agree that the location of this place is kind of strange.. right next to a big forest. i've heard nothing but glowing reviews for GTM, but mostly from their underwood shop which is too far for me. i'd definitely would make a trip to GTM2 though to see sophia.

My experience: I went to GTM for the first time about 2 weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised by quite a nice venue.  I was massaged by a cute Korean girl.  Unfortunately, I can't remember her name.  She gave a soft massage that bored me a little and asked if I'd been there before.  We all know the answer to that. There were some gentle touches but not really enough to get me going.  On the flip, I had to ask for a handy as it wasn't immediately obvious that I wanted one.  It was a rather perfunctory finish but I enjoyed it none the less.  I think I'll try again though as the venue was pretty comfortable.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

I normally go to the shop in Underwood but decided to try out the shop in Salisbury last week. I got there pretty late, around 8:30pm but was able to see a masseuse straight away. Her name was Crystal, looked and sounded to be in her late-20's or early-30's. A decent package, she looked alright from what I could see but the lights in the room were pretty dim. You can definitely tell the place is newer than the one in Underwood, it looks a lot cleaner and the interior styling looks more modern and less tacky.

Massage was very firm, just the way I like it. We talked a bit and she did mention that her favourite position was doggy style, so I found her personality quite pleasant.

She gave my thighs a nice massage and slowly escalated to the handie which was great. I much prefer the girls do it this way rather than going straight for it as the build-up for me is half the excitement. She used both hands mixing it up with a twistie motion to build it up before finishing with a nicely lubricated up-and-down pumping action. Didn't take too long before it was time to clean up, she's got great hands.

She didn't mind me touching her tits, but unfortunately she didn't have much of an ass which was a shame cos I do like giving them a good squeeze during the massage. That's me nit-picking though, I found her fantastic and would definitely go back to see her again.

Age : 25

Nationality or Ethnicity : Taiwanese

Services Provided : Massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Okay value

My experience/comments : The venue is situated opposite the road from the McDonald's Salisbury outlet. Once inside, I was greeted by a nice looking girl who asked for how long. I replied 1/2 hr and handed over a $50 note. I was shown to the room and promptly undressed. The massage table is very comfortable with plenty of padding. The room itself is quite large but the lights in the rooms are very odd with either LED green or blue lighting featured. Onto the massage, a different girl came in and did the massage and placed $10 change on a shelf. She said her name was Bella. I requested for a hard massage, it was alright not the worst but not the best that I've had. I like my massages really hard so I can't really blame for that. 

We chatted for a bit and I mentioned to her that she was quite tall, which I think she got quite a kick out of. She climbed on top of the table to work my back and then proceeded to work my lower back.  I was able to get a feel up her legs that were silky smooth. Onto the legs, the pressure was alright and then some light teasing commenced then she asked me to turnover. 

The HJ was fairly mechanical and she moved away when I was lightly teasing her thighs. She said she allowed touching but gave the excuse she didn't like the light touching because she was ticklish. This was slightly offputting and she had the audacity to give a 1 minute warning. Anyways, she cleaned me up with some tissues and I took a shower to wash off the oil.

My experience/comments : Visited this place last month with a booking and Sarah came and greeted me, Sarah is a short girl/petite girl a lil hottie in my opinion.  I was surprised since the last time i came her i had her aswell. from what i remember she was great so i was predy exited about the punt.. paid for half an hour then got nude and lied down...massage from her was great as usual she is a real professional and knows how to give amazing relaxing massage, things finally got heated up as she did some accidental touching while massaging my legs and eventually did some teasing on me ball sack while i was lying down... made me get a hard on and she told me to flip and i was ready to go..she pointed at my cock and asked if i wanted that...i said yes of course...i tried to bargain her down to 30 but no go..so we simply agreed at 40 bux...touching was a big no no  however her HJ was first class..nice and slow with plenty of teasing.. didnt last long at all..highly recommended

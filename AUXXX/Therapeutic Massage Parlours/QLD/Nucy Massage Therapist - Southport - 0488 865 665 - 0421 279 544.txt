Saw this place the other week and called in, they were busy so no go. Now I know this shop used to be called "Gina Massage" and has been reviewed as not providing extras, but as it seemed to have changed hands I thought I'd call in and see what was on the menu..
Called back on the above date and was met by an attractive Thai lady (when I first saw her I thought she was in her early 20's).Asked for 1 hr (advertised on board at front for $40.00) was told she could only do 1/2 hr. as she had a booking at 1:00pm. She offered this for $35.00 so I thought what the heck and agreed..
Went into massage area and the first thing I notice is the cubicles are only curtained off areas (similar to hospital wards).Thought not a promising sign. Anyway I nude up and lie face down on table, when she returned she covered my arse with a towel,she did leave it high up on the cheeks so the tackle was exposed somewhat. Maybe promising was my thinking. She proceeded to give a very good massage, medium pressure,(my preference) but no tickle. On turn over more of the same. All in all a good massage..
Now let me say that during the massage we were talking, she was asking about what I do/did for a living. She seemed to be obsessed with "Big Money"(her words) and earning "Big Money", so there is a chance she might be open to suggestions or negotiation..I couldn't raise the subject myself as her 1:00pm appt had arrived and was in the next cubicle..
Whilst towelling me down I was rubbing the oil off my legs and had my almost rigid old fella in full view; she didn't bat an eye lid and nor did she try to cover it . On leaving she did say to book next time so I get the whole hour and a better massage. I will definitely return and see how thing pan out..

Well visited Nucy again last Friday, this time I managed to have a 1 hr session (it's now $45 for the hour;up from $40). As mentioned in my last post on Nucy she did say the 1hr was a better option; let me tell you she didn't disappoint. I opted for the relaxation massage(the $45 mass).This massage is a medium to soft service, not firm and penetrating. Boy o boy this girl is seriously good, I've had many massages over the years and I would be hard pressed to remember a better one.
As stated in my previous post there was no sign of HE.(there are signs all over stating no sexual service available), but you never know. As I said the massage was exceptional with enough intimacy to have ones thought process racing; after finishing the back,had me turn over and covered me with a towel (same for the back) ,However the large towel was then replaced with a small hand towel which she positioned length ways over the equipment. she proceeded to massage my legs and thighs,once again great touch.She spent an awful long time on my upper thighs and hips,all around the sensitive areas, enough to have me twitching and straining for a more positive touch, then up for some chest massage for 3 or 4 mins thin back to the nether regions for some more attention.. I think she took great pleasure in seeing my discomfort and left me feeling the more one visits the more intimate the experience will be.
I never put the word on her due to the fact there was another punter in one of the cubicles (these are only curtained off enclosures) and also I didn't want to cruel any rapport I feel I may have built with her. Like I have said this lady gives a seriously good massage IMHO and is worth seeing just for the massage alone. Her massage is a great build up for a visit to a more friendly establishment.
At the end of my session she asked me how I felt;I told her that after that I'd have to go around the corner (23 Nind St).She just gave me a cheeky grin.

Hi guys.
Well visited Nucy again  last week, Wed 4th Dec. Sadly I have nothing encouraging to report, other than receiving the same great massage with just enough near misses to make you want to return (which I will). So, in light of not being able to provide a report indicating a happy outcome I shall stop posting on this ML until such time I can let you all know I managed to leave with a huge smile and not having to visit one of the nearby shops.

I was just passing this place and it looks to have closed up. Shame as I just discovered it a few days earlier and was very happy with the therapeutic massage.

Hi foolishmortal.  
Sorry for the late reply......I'm happy to report that Nucy is still operating. a coffee shop has opened next door, as a result I think she has had to remove all outside signage [sandwich board etc]. 
I have just posted a review on the new shop at 31 station st Nerang; in that I have included an up date on Nucy..
Cheers.

Hello all.
It is with much sadness I have to report that Nucy has indeed ceased to operate from these premises. It seemed to be rather sudden as i had been to see her on about the 5th Nov/2014 and her Facebook page advises her closure on the 12th Nov./2014 She mentioned nothing to me about closing when I was there during that last visit; strange, as I feel I had built a very good rapport with her over the preceding 12 mth's( I would visit about 3 times a month). I did ask her at one time to be sure to let me know if she ever changed address or decided to work solo, she said that she would... I guess these things happen...Sigh!!!....
A new business now operates from this address. It is called Kitty massage therapy.(on Nucys FB page she calls it Vicky massage. It is kitty, Vicky is the new manager.) Have visited and will post a review.

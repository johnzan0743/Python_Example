My experience/comments : Very good value from this place but strictly legit and obviously that way from the moment you walk in and if you weren't sure, the client history form you need to fill in gives it away.
I had a bit of a sore neck saw this place in passing and walked in. Clean, tidy, relaxing music, and after you are shown to your cubicle they ask you to change into some freshly laundered shorts and shirt. I won't bore anymore with the details but it was a great massage like none I've had before, painful at times but I left feeling great.

My experience/comments : Saw an ad in the therapeutic section of the Cairns post and decided to give it a shot. The ad said opening time 10am-10pm. Sent off an sms and got a quick reply and organised a time. Arrived and found a small shop in the conservatory arcade with 'Helen's Massage' signage. The shop is in a relatively discrete spot. Especially at the weekend or evening when nothing else in the vicinity is open. All looks quite legit too. Went in and Helen was sitting waiting. First impression was that she looked ok. Bit plain in terms of looks but ok. Also seemed a bit shy. A milf but way more attractive (and younger) than the old milfs at McLeod street. She was in a short tight skirt and her legs looked pretty good too. This is just a one person operation. No walk ins. You have to make a booking first. She took me to a partitioned off area at the rear of the shop with a massage table and went away while I got undressed. I spied a box of tissues next to the massage oil. No mention of the dreaded 'leave underwear on' so I totally stripped off and lay face down on the table. She returned and placed a towel over my bum and started the massage. Great touch and technique. Very firm with lots of long strokes. Plenty of rubbing of the bum and my inner thighs with the odd sensual brush. While she had covered me with the towel her strokes over my bum and legs kept pushing it away so I'm not sure why she bothered. Perhaps just being cautious. After a great massage of my back, bum and legs she asked me to flip. She placed the towel over my semi erect cock and started to massage my stomach area. A few accidental brushes of the top of my cock so I pulled the towel down and asked if she would do a HJ. She looked a bit hesitant but said okay so long as I absolutely promised to say nothing (her ad was in the therapeutic section of the Cairns Post). No mentioned of extra cash for the HJ either. And so commenced a pretty good HJ! She took her time and had a good technique as she worked my cock and balls and soon had me shooting my load. After that she cleaned me up and finished the session by massaging my legs. Paid her $75 cash at the end (no card facility). So all up a very good massage with a great HJ as the icing on the cake. A very pleasant surprise in Cairns. 

I'm not sure if she normally does a HJ or if I got lucky. So keep things very discreet and low key if you visit and enquire about extras. Certainty do not mention this review!! But her regular massage skill alone is worth a visit.

Also, after I left and was walking near the corner of Lake and Spence I noticed some window displays and signage for a massage shop I'd never seen before. Stuck my head in the door and found it was still a work in process. A very pleasant older Asian lady indicated they would be opening in around 10 days time and to come back then. Looks like it will be a pretty good fit out from what I could see. Would be great to have a nice massage shop in Cairns with some cute young Asian girls who are quite happy to offer a discreet HJ (or perhaps more) as part of their massage service. I'll definitely be checking this place out once it opens. Its also relatively discreet and not too public in terms of the entrance area. I reckon if it has the right mix of cute girls and extras it could do well.

My experience/comments : This lady advertises regularly in the Cairns post under the 'therapeutic massage' section. She has a shop in an easy to find location just on the perimeter of the cbd (easy walk if you're staying in the city) but doesn't take walk-ins. Need to either phone or text her to fix a time. I texted her and organised a time for Sunday afternoon. Arrived at the appointed time and she was waiting outside the building complex to let me in and take me to her studio. She was in a shorter dress and her legs looked pretty good which got me in the right mood for the massage. I stripped off and lay face down on the table ready for her to commence the massage. Before she started I asked about a HE and she replied $100 for the hour inclusive of HE to which I said yes. That's for a clothed HE only (not sure if more could be on offer). I hadn't made a visit for over six months but compared to last time she was more upfront and relaxed about offering a HE. But since she only advertises in the 'therapeutic section' of the local rag I figure she likes to keep things low key and discreet and we punters should respect that. The massage commenced which was pretty good. Nice firm long strokes and plenty brushes in the sensitive places. HE was slow and sensual and definitely not mechanical. Not the greatest of lookers but still quite fine and slim too with decent legs. Her manner is not the most friendly still ok. Cairns is very patchy in terms of finding a rnt but Helen seems like a sure thing.

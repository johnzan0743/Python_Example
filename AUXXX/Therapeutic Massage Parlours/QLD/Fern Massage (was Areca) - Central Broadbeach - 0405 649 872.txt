 Fern Massage (was Areca) - Central Broadbeach - 0405 649 872
				
Post Content: 
Hey Guys, I saw this massage joint in Broadbeach on the backside of the Phoenician, where Subway, Cha Cha's and the TAB is. I saw a hot looking milf go in and a punter following her in. After an hour or so, I approached the shop which you have to walk up stairs to get to and was told I wouldn't leave disappointed but unfortunately the two masseuses waiting for me looked like they had been mauled by a starving dog. 

Does anyone else have some info on this at all, as it seems like there are no search results on this one. 

Any info would be greatly appreciated.

Hey GC, 

I had a walk past late last night and unfortunately the address is different and there's definitely no laneway access to this, making it 1) a riskier and more public punt and 2) not the same place.

For the record the street number is 2717 which doesn't correspond to the other post, I thought it may just be a typo but that strip of shops with rife with massage parlours so it looks like we're not talking about the same joint unfortunately. 

Nonetheless, thanks for your help, we need more people like you on the gc

It used to be called areca massage and a couple of the girls that used to work there are still there. The rest has changed. Normally they charge 40 for massage and 20 for extras

Its funny redlight, I was actually going to post as on friday I tried calling the Areca massage joint only to receive the massage by fern voice mail service. So they definitely do extras then mate?

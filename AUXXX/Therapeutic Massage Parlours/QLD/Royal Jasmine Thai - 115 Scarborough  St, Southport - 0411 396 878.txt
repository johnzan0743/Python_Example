My experience/comments : 

After finishing my tasks for the day I found myself with some time to indulge in some carnal relaxation. Instead of heading down to Crombie Av. I thought I'd give this place a try... It's closer for me... I'd seen it in passing on a few occasions and made a mental note to give it a try..I got there just as she was closing but she agreed to stay to look after me. She looked familiar to me, so I made a note to ask some questions a bit later. went down the back of the shop (the last room). I didn't count, but I think there were about 4 rooms in total, they're roomy enough, clean(as is the shop in general) and with walls which don't reach the very high ceilings, there are no doors as such, only curtains which are drawn across. So,not the most private or discrete situation as far as making a noise is concerned. We got underway with the massage;she uses a bit more oil (warmed) than I'm used to, but this didn't pose any problem as she wiped me down with a hot cloth after. The massage was very good with a lot of (not so) accidental crazing and touching of the dangly bits (not a definite tackle tease as such), she also massaged right into the groin area which felt incredible. At this point I was definitely thinking more would be on offer. Eventually asked to turn over, and the action continued on my front; with the accidents still occurring. By this time it was painfully (to me) obvious that it was having quite an effect on me,so, the question was put, accepted and finished to my relief and satisfaction. 
During all the above action I was talking  to her (her English isn't all that good,and at times a bit hard to understand, but we managed). It turns out she has only been operating in these premises for 5 months. It turns out she previously had the shop across the road at 119 Scarborough St.(when I learned this I was sure of a HE.) She did, however, tell me she doesn't provide this service for people she hasn't seen before but will oblige for(some) repeat customers. She was also emphatic that she does not offer any other extras, and that her main focus is the massage....( I seem to remember it took me two visits to 119 before I got lucky)....All in all I would say it was a pretty good punt and I would be happy to return at some later date..

Ok. After my 'fail' at Sapa I felt I had better make my way to "Royal Jasmine" to finish the day off properly  ....Now I'm totally confused!!! As this time round, same masseuse, same duration but no HE provided or indicated. Maybe it was because it was the early afternoon, I don't know. Last time I was there she was in the act of closing, so probably no chance of any one coming in. Anyway, it looks like this place could be a bit hit and miss, so I will think twice about returning any time soon.

My experience/comments :Has gorgeous young Asian students working but they only do massage and Julie the boss will finish you off.She is friendly and very generous with her time allowance.She also has a great body but she keeps her clothes on.Definitely worth a visit and I will be back for sure.

She offers two prices at the start,one with happy ending and one without. I'm pretty sure it was $50 without and $70 with. Staff are dressed in singlets and short shorts and all are gorgeous young things.

Julie will let you have a feel during the happy ending but I don't think she would go nude.Her business card states "Free massage after 5th visit" but I'm not sure if this still applies.
Excellent value!

Any chance Julie used to be in a shop on the west side a while back? God I'd love to see her again...

Sounds like the same lady. You mean Heaven in Indooroopilly. Best place I ever frequented! I'd love a confirmation on that as well. Stafford is way out of my way.

I remember Heaven in Indooroopilly. Station Rd, right? Lot of Jap girls there, reasonable prices. Closed in 2008.

That's the one, just wasn't sure if I should name it or not. I was a big fan haha. If its the same lady I'm on my way as we speak  There were a few there I like but Julie was my favourite by far. Just something about her.

About the business hours: Today (Sat) they close at 5pm. ... well they're "open until 5" but someone already has a booking for 5pm. Ok so is there any RnT left around Stafford for Saturday evening?

So I managed to make a booking a few months ago. $70 for 30 min RnT. A young chubby Chinese girl started to give me a massage which was ok. Nothing spectacular but still ok. 15 minutes later, Julie walks in. We had agreed in the beginning that there'd be a happy ending so it wasn't a surprise. What was kind of strange was that the other girl stayed in the room while Julie was jerking me off. That's something that you have to be mentally prepared for, at least if you're used to having a bit more privacy or intimacy. I didn't ask if it was ok but I found my hand between her legs and she didn't seem to object. Their clothes stayed on the whole time but then again, I didn't ask. 

I got a loyalty card when I left. She asked if I wanted them to keep track of my visits or if I wanted a loyalty card so I'd have two ways to get the same rewards.  The card says "Present this card for $10 off your first visit" and "Free massage after your fifth visit". I'm actually thinking of going back there. It's the best RnT in Stafford after all.

Person's Name : Julie

Establishment : Julie's Chinese Massage

Date of Visit : 10/09/16

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0430 710 326

Hours of Business : 

Rates : 60/hr massage and rages for the HJ 30-50

Age : 40-60. Asian hard to pick it

Size/shape : Normal, nothing amazing but makes up for it with the massage

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided :  Massages only. Haven't had a FS there

Value for money/recommend? : Definitely. 

My experience/comments :

When I first started going to Julie she had a stable of women with only 1 of those not being hot enough to get a special massage from.

Julie herself while order isn't bad looking and if you treat her well and with respect you can also get her clothes off as well for free.

Julie gives a great massage and a very tailored ending to the massage. She takes her time and doesnt try to rip your cock off to get you out the door. Highly recommend and have been back over 2 dozen times.

Probably need to book another massage....

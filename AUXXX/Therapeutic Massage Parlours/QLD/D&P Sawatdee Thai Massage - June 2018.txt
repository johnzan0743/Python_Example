My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Was up in Brisbane for one of the big games and decided on a later evening massage the night  before the game. 

Wondered the CBD for a bit and came across D&P. 

Wondered up the stairs invisible to the many people outside.

asked for 30 minute massage and was taken to a room. negotiated NHJ straight up and said we've got 30 minutes let's get straight in. The massage lady was very tired - in fact yawned throughout and I swear at one stage fell asleep on her feet! 

Anyway massage started with her pouring an entire bowl of oil over me (after asking for no oil!) and I had so much oil on me i thought I was going to slide off the bed, out the door and down the stairs at one stage. After the worst massage of all time she started a hammer tug and and eventually i had to ask her to stop and finished up myself. 

First dud punt in a long time - literally a 0.5/10. Suggest to avoid fellow mongerers...

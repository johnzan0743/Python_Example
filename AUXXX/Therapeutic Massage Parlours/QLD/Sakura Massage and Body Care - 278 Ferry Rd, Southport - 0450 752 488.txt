My experience/comments : Seen this advert for a few weeks  but no reviews on site so decided to toftt.
Been past a few times and place looked likey with the blue and red light on door. A unit on ferry road opposite Toyota..... all japanese so far.....
Went about 7.00pm and greeted by a pleasant young lady but didnt look overly interested, was shown a card with various massages avail and prices. Had intented having the 1 hr japanese massage @ $60 but changed to the cheapest to test the water and that was $40 for 1/2 hr.
Off to room which was clean and tidy unit having just been refurbished for purpose of massage.
The receptionist did the massage and started softly so i requested firm but that didn,t really happen. She seemed a little on the tired side probably been there all day so just went a long with it. She was pleasant girl and along the way asked if extras were available and i think she was hoping i didnt ask that question as she sort of stuttered out no. Ok so finished massage face down with a warm towel wipe down and scooted out of the room. So on leaving she presented at reception door to thank me for custom and i couldnt help asked the question if on returning would xtras be available but only received a innocent look. So there you are............
Be interested to know if anyone done better than wot i received. Not prepared to fork out any more of my punting allowance to find out..lol

Well Kapai you probably guessed correctly. 

I don't think extras of any kind are on in this place. It is rather new. I went a number of weeks ago. The masseuse was gorgeous trim body very good looking in the face and great smile and attitude. But with all that going for her not a chance of anything other than a semi decent massage.

The place was opened about March this year 2013 and is very well setout. Rooms are private and seperate and well set up but there probably won't be any hanky panky happening here unless the fun police announce it is okay. We all know that aint gunna happen.

The probability of this place surviving as a straight massage place is probably non-existent unless it is simply a laundering device for the Yakuza.
One would think if they were involved there would be extras offered but these guys like a simple laundry operation so sadly there probably won't be any action happenijng here.

You made the same wise (I believe) choice which was go the cheap option and test the waters. A wise move if you dislike parting with money on a punt especially a risky one such as this. Most of the ones (punts) that pay are not as open to advertising big or open to main roads. Believe it or not these parlours rely on one off punters as opposed to regulars as there are many tourists willing to spend their hard earned on a chance.
It is probably okay if you want a straight massage buy a young good looking japanese girl. But not if you want anything else.

BTW Mods the suburb is Southport Qld.

The name of this establishment is "Sakura Massage and Body Care" on the business card it states "The Best Japanese Style Massage"

The opening hours on their business card are 9am to 7pm. Perhaps This should be highlighted as they are not open after usual business hours and certainly not after 7pm.

The suburb is SOUTHPORT. Certainly worth the visit as some of the girls are really very good looking. IMHO.

well, I did some research.. firstly the ad on gumtree states "not a sexual service".. and I know that can just be for show.. but I think it's for real. Also If I'm not mistaken, the lady that owns it is a legitimate masseuse, as in medicnal ... so chances are this place is legit..... maybe ahve to go there afew times? but i doubt it.. would be great to be proved wrong.. LOL

You may well be right RJ. I believe there is another site with the same name in Brisbane so there may be a connection and then again perhaps not. The fact that there are no certificates on the walls apart from the D.A. and the Business registration might suggest that the way to actually research is to attend as both kapai and myself have. 
Also Gumtree has as part of its posting guidelines for advertising massage that a declaration of "No sexual service" be attached to every ad. They remove ads that fail to have that disclaimer attached. 
If you have been into any one of the numerous Chinese rnt shops anywhere you no doubt will have seen the "No sex" signs that indicate nothing really because they are put there for council inspectors so they can state "we don't allow sex on these premises and if it is offered we sack girl. Nothing to do with us." Of course girl is not sacked just told be careful next time.

Legit massage places do not have pretty girls without qualifications massaging. These girls are pretty but not qualified.

I doubt that they will offer any other services as members on this forum look for apart from a half decent massage by a good looking girl. 
As stated above this place gets by possibly laundering money from others or maybe (Yakuza) illegitimate  operations and they certainly would not make enough money to pay both girls and the rent plus overheads such as advertising. You must ask yourself how many parlours are going broke whilst normally astute japanese businessmen start up another venture.
If the place survives the downturn in the economy on the GC for more than a few months then they will be offering more or they are simply a front for washing money through. The premises are large and the rent would not be insubstantial. Paying upkeep and the staff suggests that something else is on the menu. Probably not massage but more of a laundry for others. This place has the appearance of being legit. Well sorta kinda. As they have several rooms but only two girls on each shift and are not that busy you do the maths. The individual of which you speak doesn't actually work there. 

If you want to know if someone claiming to be medically qualified then you only need to look at 104a Scarborough Southport but have your running shoes on. 
I have had my cock pulled by many TCM Doctors. Or rather by some who claim that qual. Have had my cock inside of a few as well.

It appears that ethics walk when money talks. 

There is a male on the lease so perhaps the information you have is less than accurate.

I usually ask my local quack for some samples. The pharma reps are always dropping samples off to larger Medical practices and if you attend a GP Clinic on a fortnightly basis and plead poor you usually can walk away with a few sample packs.  They contain one tablet in a pack. They are bundled in packs of two or three. Cialis by Lilly has fewer side effects than Pfizer's Viagra. But I usually scam whatever is going. Still you probably should go to the doc to get a script then make arrangements with a Pharmacy where you can use whatever CC you like. Some Pharmacies will sell you at their cost price and that is cheaper than the direct off the net sales. BTW Off the net sales beware of substitute counterfeit products. I sat next to a guy in the GP's waiting room who had bought a corrupted tablet and he was very sick not to mention very hard and embarrassed.
Just a suggestion. 
If your source only accepts Visa now why not go to St George Bank one in Southport and they can organise a Visa debit/credit card for you if your own Bank doesn't do this. That or purchase a pre-loaded no bank link no id required Visa Debit card. There are some good posts on the discussion thread about the use of these cards. They can be purchased at any Australia Post Office.
Good luck.

Person's Name : Eriko

Establishment : Sakura Massage and Body Care

Date of Visit : 16/06

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 278 Ferry Road. 0450752488

Hours of Business : 7 days, 9am - 7pm

Rates : $60 for 60 mins

Age : Late 20s

Size/shape : Petite Japanese girl, Size 10/B Cup?

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : For massage only, yes

This place is relatively near where I live so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I felt like a nice massage and wasn't overly concerned if I didn't get my unit cranked.  This place is pretty much directly opposite Toyota on Ferry Rd.  Parking out the front felt a bit exposed or something, a lot of traffic goes past there.  I elected to park down the side street and walk around.  Place is clean and tidy and clearly a house converted to massage studio usage.  Greeted by a nice girl at the front desk who showed me a price list.  Lots on there, Shiatsu, Relaxation, Foot Massage, all sorts.  I opted for 60 mins of relaxation massage for $60.  Seemed like a good price to me.  Led to a tidy room with the usual sort of set up.  Girl left me to get undressed saying "take off all your clothes and lie down I'll be right back".  So no wondering about whether to nude up or not, I liked that.  
Few mins later she comes back, and gets prepared.  She doesn't rush to - but eventually covers my butt with a towel.   I'd say she's late 20s, about 5'2" moderately attractive with B cup boobs.  

What followed was a wonderful relaxing massage with oil and hot towels.  She left no spot untouched..  except my tackle.  As she moved down the table to concentrate on my thighs and legs she very precisely avoided any tickle tackle contact.  I was just about asleep when she started with the hot towels on my back and then asked me to flip over.  Wasn't really expecting this, but..  ok.  As I spun over she used the towel to hide/cover my junk..  quite politely really.  She then massaged my chest, scalp, shoulders stomach and legs from the front.  Again using very precise strokes around the thighs to avoid any contact with LittleDawg.  He was asleep anyway...   

She finished up with the hot towels and said for me to take my time getting dressed.  I had that nice dazed/glow feeling after a great massage.  Very nice.

I got dressed and as I passed through reception my masseuse was there with another Japanese lady, they were both very polite and lovely to talk to although their difficulty understanding me led to a couple of awkward moments.  The other girl looked taller and prettier than my masseuse.  
As I was headed for the door my girl handed me a business card with the shop's details on it, and her name: Eriko.  She also had a clipboard with what looked like client information on it.  She already had my name and then asked me for my phone number.  I said "uh...  why?".   She didn't really have a reply to that and said "nevermind".  Hmm...

All in all a great massage with very polite ladies in a very clean shop.  As per the other comments in this thread, I don't know if anything more would ever be on offer here..  but if you're after a really decent massage you can't go wrong here.  I'll probably go back to this place a few times and see what happens.  If it spices up at all, I'll be sure and let you blokes know.

A good review. Very similar to my experience save I had the taller good looking girl.

Fairly certain that these guys are not going anywhere near doing anything other than a straight massage. As stated before there is another agender at play here. The place is not busy enough or staffed with enough girls to make enough to sustain it. Especially when one considers the depressed local economy. Thanks Campbell. This place would go under if not for the other agender and the tourist and first timer clientelle. They are paying way more than a residential/ commercial lease rate for this property. Interesting to see if anything happens. Watch this space. As for stating the obvious regarding advertising contact details. Well observed.

If I had to guess the place is set up as a business to sponsor Japanese girls so that they can get their Permanent Resident visa. If you google the number on gumtree you can see a link to a Japanese advert that talks a lot about visa opportunities.

I saw Honami the other day for a body scrub. I've had proper body scrubs in Japan and Korea, and you are totally nude and they do the front and back (usually not the genitals though if the place is legit). Honami is 29 years old and very friendly and talkative. The body scrub was not really good, she wasn't nearly strong enough to exfoliate properly and she only only covered my back from shoulders to feet, rather than turning me on my side and front as they do in Japan and Korea. It was followed by a moisturizing massage, which was very soft. She only touched my balls once while doing my thighs, accidentally; definitely not deliberately as she apologised after the slip. For $79, it lasted a good hour and 20 minutes and I genuinely enjoyed talking to her, she is very genuine and not fake. 

If you want a nice conversation with a pretty girl, then go for it. Who knows what could happen if you were a regular customer.

Had my second massage here and it was much the same as my review above, and completely legit.  The girl I had this time was plainer looking and her massage was not quite as good but still good value for $60 for 60 mins.  There was no hint of anything even slightly naughty though.  Towels covering butt/junk the whole time and not even accidental touches.

However a guy came in (I could hear him talking in the waiting area) right before closing..  they have squeaky tables in this place and I could hear a lot of "repetitive squeaking" coming from another table in the place.  Either he was getting a serious massage or a HJ.  Who knows? 

Anyway the girls here are polite, cute and very sweet and give a great massage.  I'll probably take one more punt here (my back is messed up at the moment) because I feel like they give an actual proper massage and not a HJ with a massage thrown in you know?

Have it on excellent authority now that both these parlours Ferry road and Gateway Harbourtown are cash washing carwashes and laundrys. 

A suggestion is if you want your happy snapped faces going into a rather large dossier then by all means continue patronising these two places. 

DO NOT PARK ANYWHERE NEAR THEM as your plates will be recorded and your identity noted or the reg owner of the transport you are using id will be recorded.

Sorry cannot make these points any more simpler than that. Don't ask Won't tell policy is in force for this INTEL.

Fellas the numbers of shops opening is diluting the few punters around if indeed you keep giving your hard earned to these so called "Legit" shops! 
The reason these reviews need to be read and heeded is if all the shops that offer extras go to the wall through lack of patronage due to punters trying to crack Fort Knox Bullion safes open then the few decent punts that are currently available will disappear faster than you can say Erection!

Remember punt with your heads not over them! 

Oh and gamble responsibly!

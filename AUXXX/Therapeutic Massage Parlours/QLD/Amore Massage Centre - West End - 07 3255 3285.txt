My experience/comments : 

I did not realise I had walked into Amore Massage's sister shop in West End until Candy handed me a loyalty card at the end. So, I was not sure what to expect here. The first tell came in the question "Have you been here before?" As discussed elsewhere at length - always answer yes!

The other thing I look for is tissues in the room, which were absent here. But soon into the massage, the innappropriate touches came on and I became sure.

Candy was wearing a really baggy dress, so it was impossible to guage what she had hidden under there. But when she pulled it off, there was a smokin body, with barely any fat, a flat gut and a set of tits that were really big for her frame. Massive.

The next thing I appreciated was that as soon as her tits were out, she placed may hand on the closest one. She didn't try and squeeze more money. Clever girl. She understands that if I have a handful of mammary, I'm going to evacuate the contents of my jizz factory a lot quicker. When a girl won't let me touch, I quite enjoy watching her get frustrated over the course of 30 minutes before I get my blow on. But I reckon it only took about 3 minutes today. 

It's a little on the steep side, so Amore may not be for the penny-pinching punter. But I had a great punt there this evening

It was $150 total. $65 for the massage and $85 for the rub + topless. Like I said, not cheap. But great quality.

Tried this place today...down the end of the Asian arcade....  It seems completely  legit. Massage was ok... seemed to know genuine Chineses massage techniques... Strangley she rubbed against me and kept touching my butt... but nothing happened...  maybe I looked like an inspector! 

So anyone else tried this place and can confirm this???

I just walked in... I didn't think to write the number down..although it's on the sign outside. The address is the asian mall that runs between Surfers Paradise Boulevard and Orchid Ave. And its right at the end on Orchid Ave. They also have a sign on the footpath at the Surfers Paradise Boulevard end.

It's legit... it's the same owner as happy Dragon on Chevron, healthy dragon on marine parade... and happy oriental in new shop at miami, near burleigh... The surfers shop is legit, the other are the go.

None of the shops in surfers are RnT, they are all legit... I spent a fortune going to all of them about a year ago... The closeset for a thrill is actually sabai, where, they make you keep underwear on, but then proceed to touch the equipment a little. But even there is nothing. Read my reveiws on here

I spent the time and money, so that you don't need to!  hahaha

Go to Southport, or head down GC Highway. Of course Happy Dragon is closest to Surfers...

I just finished reading your surfers foray's. Im surprised they are all legit! Especially golden touch seeing the way it set p (solid wall rooms and doors), especially given they are owned by a company that owns several RnT massage parlors! The girls there are hot, I see you went in 2011, wondering if its worth another punt?

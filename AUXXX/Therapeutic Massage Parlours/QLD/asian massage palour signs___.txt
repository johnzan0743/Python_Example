 asian massage palour signs???
				
Post Content: 
Not a review... but has anyone else noticed that quite a few of the massage palours in and around surfers have the same advertising board??? same pictures even... just different phone numbers... what does this mean...   

is there a dirty little signwriter out there swapping signwriting for punts???? or has an asian exteneded family moved into the massage game???  

I noticed today that Magic Touch down in surfers had specials out $45 for one hour???? can't be right??? maybe that is the basic one???

Haha FF, have seen that one in Soi Cowboy, but wasn't sober enough to engrave the image in silver halides (or was it digital??).

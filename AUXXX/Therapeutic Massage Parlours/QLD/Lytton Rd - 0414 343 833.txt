I got an SMS one afternoon to say specials. 50/hr massage.
Nice new girl. I thought I'd try it out.

Well don't.

Clean (but empty) house on a main road with parking out the back. Not my cup of tea as it is in plain view on a main road.
I wasn't 100% sure of what was happening here so changed at the beginning to $30 30 mins.
Had a nice but mechanical massage from Jessica. Nice young student. I'd say early 20s. 
Kept running out when the phone was ringing and the door swings wide open exposing me to anyone walking through the house. Not Great. 
There was no touching or teasing me during the massage. At the end, I'm haven't been rolled over yet, she runs off and a old pork chop comes in to offer the tug. $30 extra. I didn't get her name.
I said no thanks (I actually said no, I can get a massage for that!! Humour didn't catch on.) Was offered $20 and said ok.
Very mechanical. Ask to see her boobs but no. Not really getting anywhere so I run my leg up her legs and ass.
She used a tissue to clean up and left immediately.
Dressed, walk out and then was prompting offered a have 5 massages get one free card. 
I think more skills in the RnT area rather than marketing is required here.

3/10. But for $50 RnT, you get what you pay for.
No return visit from me.

Probably tried a number out of the CM one day for an enquiry. I don't block my number.

Advertised in CM as 'Beautiful massage by Taiwan Lady' 3397 0988 I rang on a Sunday morning for a massage, asked for extras. The girl giggled and said "You been here before?" So we arranged a time, $70 for half hour. 
I turned up...Sunday there is parking around the back. Very pleasant girl Suzanne or Susan opened the door, she locks the front door if she has a customer. I got undressed, she put clean towels on the massage table. They probably do a lot of legit massage and the massage was ok...a lot of sensual touching and she didn't mind me touching. Turned over she asked if I wanted the 'puppies' out...is the pope catholic?? very beautiful natural tits and lovely soft skin. Suzanne is a very cheerful friendly girl...not brilliant english but good enough. Very nice experience...will go back again.
 I think the thing that makes it for me is not the looks of the girl...although she was attractive, but the manner in which they deal with you. I have had others where I couldn't wait to go and yet they were 'beautiful'. Go figure.

This post was moved form initial reviews to the "Pure Massage" thread as it is of a non sexual nature and thus does not qualify as an initial review.

I've been to this place in Yuletide St twice. The first time was a young looking, very sweet asian girl, the second time was an older, very harsh sounding thing. I paid $100 for a 30 min massage that included a BBBJ. They both wash you thoroughly before hand with soapy warm water and then with a rubbing alcohol - I guess to see if you have any cuts or sores? The younger girl was good, but allowed no real touching, whereas the older one lets you poke and prod at whatever you like.

The couple of things that turned me off were no CIM or COB...but the deal breaker was the disgusting spitting that the older thing did. I'm talking the sort of spitting that truckies do.

I wont be going back there.

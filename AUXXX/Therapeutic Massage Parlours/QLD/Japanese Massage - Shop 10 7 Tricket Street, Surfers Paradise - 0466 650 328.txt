Hours of Business : 11am - 8pm.

Rates : 60 / hour

Size/shape : Size 10 with D cups

Services Provided : Massage ONLY 

Value for money/recommend? : If you like being drenched in oil sans shower sans hand job, then yes!

My experience/comments :

I will keep this short and sweet as unfortunately nothing went on here. I saw this place earlier on and noticed it had asian girls working there but wanted to see a cauc. After finding what looked like the Ad on Locanto, I called them and was sent back a text message asking if they had any aussie girls. I was replied back in the affirmative and then asked if the aussie lass did a sexy massage and was told it depends on her mood 

Finally was able to tee up an appointment and although no towel was on me whilst I was on my front, once on the back, the strategic placing and folding of the towel would mean that my cock would not get a seeing to. Thinking now or never, I asked her how she usually get tips and hinted to see if she was in a good mood or not, she bluntly said that all she ever would do was massage. Whilst we had a really good chat I couldn't help but feel an air of tension after that. 

All in all it was actually a good massage for 60 bucks, but I was drenched in oil and that feeling of leaving without some relief after a pretty white girl has massaged you was not the funnest. Truth be told this was the first massage I had without a hand relief as I like to make sure what I'm getting but I figured with this girl I'd have to approach the topic only while I was on my back as anything else might trigger a sense of hostility. 

Whilst she did say that some girls may offer some other extras, this is not her kettle of tea. Be interesting to see if anyone else has seen her and their experience with her. Who knows, she may not have been attracted to me hahaha. 

Happy Punting boys

The Japanese bloke who is the author of all the replies is a bit of a shame. The Asian girls that did HE have been moved from the original shop in Pine Ave  to his springwood business. ie the girls photo in the Locanto ad.I believe she is his girlfriend-seen them out socially. When he closed Pine av he kept same no for awhile. He always writes suggestive replies but don't think would be successful here with HE but you never know. As with my visit here excellent massage.

It's funny you mention Springwood Kapai, cause Victoria mentioned to me that sometimes she works in Springwood too and it's basically up to the boss' discretion where she works on any given day. Maybe they just try and use the Surfers business as a legitimate business cause realistically it doesn't make sense for these girls to work there. If they are on 50% commission (which Victoria confirmed they are) the max they can make in an hour is 30 bucks, after 6 one hour massage they made 180 but realistically they would never do that many hour long massages. By the end of it, one would assume they would be quite sore from all the massaging and after a full day's work have realistically only been making 20 bucks an hour assuming they were there for 9 or so hours. 

It would be interesting to see if someone has seen victoria (aka, the aussie girl) at Springwood cause with her rack and her hands, I think a happy ending would be quite a fun experience.

Post Content: 
Establishment : Small massage, inside mall on ground floor of hotel in Trickett St 

Date of Visit : April 2014

Hours of Business : 10am to late

Rates : $80 + $50

Age : 20ish

Size/shape : Average - size 10

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korea

Services Provided : Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experince/Comments :

I was up on the Coast from Melbourne with the family for a break.  The ball and chain was no use to me, so I decided I needed to find a massage parlor that could relieve my tension.  I can across this one on the net (sorry - cannot remember if it was Lacanto or what), so wondered down to try out.  It was a week night, so the town was quiet by contrast.  I got to the shop by about 8pm, and only the one girl available.  Went in under the pretense of getting a massage, and just wanting to try my luck.  Not bad massage, and on the flip, proceeded to cover me up (bad sign).  I dropped a few hints re other/ special services, but due to a very bad language issue, she didn't get my drift until about 10 mins to go.  She offered me a male toy for some DIY action, which I have never done, and wasn't going to start now.  I persisted with the hinting, and when I offered some money ($50) she slowly came around to the idea of a rub.  Wasn't allowed to touch, even her arse, so took me a while to reach popping point.  A positive was that she seemed that new and uncomfortable with the whole scenario that I might have actually been one the only ones to get the treatment from here.  Quick clean up, and left to return home.WIR - Hell no, not unless standards improve anyway.

Thank you for your concern for providers Air Travel in posting this review in a place where it couldn't be seen by snoopers.

I have relocated it to the main forum to continue to protect it, and so you will find it when you become Silver.

I wasn't aware that Studio 14 had a Korean girl, but it definitely is possible, but yes for the Record, Carla who's review I've posted in Private massage ladies provided her service from Studio 14, maybe she's the owner, who knows.

I think from your review you went to the Japanese massage shop.

There's 3 massage shops in that small mall and studio 14 always has a older white lady working there and the Japanese shop is the best shop with always pretty young Japanese girls working there.

But its owned by a Japanese man, that makes it really hard to make a appointment.

I txt him last week to make a appointment with 1 of the girls for  6:30, got to the shop at 6:30, the shop door was locked, but lights were on, so knocked on the door, see the pretty Japanese girl quickly poke her head out thru the curtains. so I waited for another 5 minutes for her to open the door, but she never did. so txt the jap man to see whats happening  and he txt back "sorry another customer came to the shop and I couldn't turn him away"

grrr and im like wtf I just drove 10 km for a massage booking.....

But what was interesting, im pretty sure the Japanese girl was topless, when she poked her head thru the curtains. might try again tomorrow.

suggests, with the other review thread (see below)  that the Japanese shop may be in the same mall, but shop 10.

If you and wingman agree, the thread can be merged with the reviews of the
Japanese shop here,  http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f111/j...=0466+650+328+

Person's Name :   Wendy

Establishment :   QJ

Date of Visit :   01/12/2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :   172 A Gympie Rd, Kedron QLD 4031, Australia (07) 3857 4058

Hours of Business :    9-7pm

Rates :   65/hr

Age :   20+

Size/shape :   slim

Nationality or Ethnicity :   chinese

Services Provided :   HJ

Value for money/recommend? :   okay / yes (just) see description

My experience/comments : Saw  Wendy the other day from QJ Msg.

She is a petite lady in her ver early 20's. Face is about 6.5 out of 10  and is cute more than pretty. not much boobs but an okay bum.

any way the massage is about 7 out of 10, nothing impressive but she  does made a decent effort. Her front massage technique is okay but not  quite my liking but bros who likes hard and rough would feel different.

She doesnt allow too much touching but has a friendly and pleasant  manner. Recommended? yes but just. Would i return, only if desperate  primarily due my dislike to her unrefine technique.

My experience is that QJ girls ask for HJ is between $30 to $50 - the majority being $40. Touching of legs and bums (clothed) were generally allowed. On a few occasions, i got lucky and went a little further than that - it all depends who the girl is and what the girl (same girl!) feel like on the day - what works in one session might not work in another.

Person's Name : Coco

Establishment : Qian Jin Massage

Date of Visit : 22/04/2012

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 172 A Gympie Rd, Kedron QLD 4031, Australia (07) 3857 4058

Hours of Business : 9am - 8-9pm ish (varies)

Rates : 45/half 65/1hr

Age : early 20s

Size/shape : slim, but great butt

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage + "therapeutic" service

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, but wouldn't return for her

My experience/comments : Coco is a normal, cute looking young girl. Did not have much of a conversation during the session. Massage was decent but not really firm enough for my liking. Looked very innocent as she gave me the "therapeutic" service. Was great to run my hand around her bum as it was nice, round, and firm. I'm pretty glad I got Coco that day because the other girl there was a thick, unattractive looking chinese girl with funny colored hair. Nice girl, but not really my type.

 Ocean Massage - 172 Gympie Rd Kedron
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Cherry

Establishment : Ocean Massage - Kedron

Date of Visit : 18-04-2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 172 Gympie Rd Kedron

Hours of Business : 9am till late

Rates : booked for $65/hr

Age : Early 20s

Size/shape : 6

Nationality or Ethnicity : Unsure - female though

Services Provided : Massage + HJ + topless

Value for money/recommend? : Yep, recommended

My experience/comments : Frustrated with the service of my regular Brisbane shops I saddle the steed and took an adventure out to the northside of Brisbane. Since the roadworks for the ICB and tunnels this shop can be difficult to spot. As you travel along Gympie Rd and pass Stafford Road then the medical centre, slow down as you turn left into side street just before the crest and they are behind the Rent My Property place. So list your house take the rent to Ocean Massage 

Anyway, I turned up without a booking and saw two girls in reception chilling out, apparently a slow day. Cherry shot up and took me to a room, which was huge, clean and comfortable. So in a place like that you just nude up and mount up. Took an hour and paid my $65.

Cherry came back and started the massage. I usually do a firm massage and her massage just melted the muscles. No stone left unturned or untickled (is that a word). She is a very easy girl to talk to and enjoys a good laugh which made it all the more enjoyable. When she was finished she went for the hot towel and started cleaning the oil off. She does not use a lot of oil but nice they take the time. Then came the roll over and the question "You want extra?". Of course.

$50 for the HJ, this was very slow, sensual and my my god enjoyable. When asked if anything else on offer, for extra $20 she will go topless and let you play with them but that is it. After the usual ending she once again cleaned me up and that was that.

If you are going past this place I recommend you try it out.

I assumed he just confused the question for 'nationality'? With a name like Cherry I'm putting money in Asian though...

Person's Name : Laura

Establishment : Ocean Star, Kedron

Date of Visit : 11/10/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : (07) 33571162

Hours of Business : 9AM - 7:30PM

Rates : 60mins / $65

Age : early 20's

Size/shape : 8-10, fair rack!

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Yes VFM

My experience/comments : One of the regular shops for me. They have a store in Kedron & Chermside. I seem to never leave unhappy 

Laura is one of my regulars. She gives a good massage. When I was there the other day I was of course looking forward to the ending, but I did have a sore neck. Her massage really sorted it out. 

The ending is never rushed. Credit where credit's due!

Good shop, I couldn't recommend it highly enough. The shop at Kedron has 3 rooms, as does the one at Chermside (from memory - I usually stick to Kedron). Rooms are all private. 

Cheers all.

I don't think so. It was Qian Jin Massage Centre before that business got busted by the fuzz.

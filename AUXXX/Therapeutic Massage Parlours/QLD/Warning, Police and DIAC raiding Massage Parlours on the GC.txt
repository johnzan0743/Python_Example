 Warning, Police and DIAC raiding Massage Parlours on the GC
				
Post Content: 
Hey guys, 

Just a quick warning amongst news reports that the Police Force and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship are raiding massage parlours for illegal activity and incorrect use of visas. The raids occurred today and reports say this will happen again. I personally don't visit these places for that very reason, but if you choose to do so, I'd suggest lying low for a few weeks till the commotion goes and visit a PML in the meantime. 

Wingman, reporting for duty!

Well from what I understood, the raids hold a three-fold purpose. 

1) Checking for links or association with Bikies and or money launderors. 

2) Checking the Status of Visa's 

3) Checking for evidence of prosititution.

I can tell you it is any shops which are known to have Bikie associations along with shops that have been opened recently and all shops that have had warrants to show their books for ATO Audits in the past five years. I am glad this is now out in the open. The best time to attend one of these shops is at least two days after the raid. These raids will be ongoing so best find a shop which has no staff turnover and is legit. I know there are a few like that but just heed the warning. With the new powers Qld Police have unfettered they can arrest you without charge and hold you so best be careful. Proceed with caution. Be civil if they ask you any questions but do not admit to engaging in any illegal actiivities no matter how friendly the cops appear to be. 

I would say stay away but that would be unfair on the commericial enterprise that these businesses are there for. Remember unless the premises is a proscribed premise then you are doing nothing illegal by attending the premises unless you admit you are a dickhead. In which case they will probably charge you accordingly.
If you are not a bikie I doubt they would be interested in you. Just remember to park your Harley Fatboy around the back. 


Biggus.

Every building, be it a rnt or any other sort of shop needs to comply with the local building and fire safety codes. But I would have thought that would be a job for Council building inspectors rather than Police.

Happy Dragon was raided on Wednesday and they photographed all the girls that were there and their sister shop in Miami was raided on Monday.  Same thing happened.

I hope they had a warrant to take the photos as identity checks for Visa puposes. They probably had an AFP officer in attendance along with an Immigration Officer to be legitimately able to take pictures. But unless you were there and read the warrant you would not know for sure. Qld coppers are plodders and not too sharp so I guess they will likely use whatever digital age devices they can get their hands on to assist so someone else can do their job for them.

Now as I said the only problem you will have in SEQld is if you are admitting to being a dickhead. Whilst those of us old enough to remember the corruption in the days of old Sir Joh and Russ Hinze his Police Minister and the conduct and behaviour of the Qld Police will be holding our breath waiting for a return to this style of fascist State and oppression of individuals and their rights to associate freely.
Just remember guys that the NSW border is very close and there will likely be an explosion in new establishments under the far less imposing regime of a Liberal Government than is in the state of NSW. 

A literal exit of establshments from SEQ will occur along with the tourist dollars unless these idiots learn that there are consequences for cracking down on businesses that have scant relative interactivity with Bikie gangs and the tenuous connections being used to extend a law and order crackdown to all businesses in the SEQld area will only lead to further erosion of business confidence in what is turning out to be one of the worst decisions made by Qld voters in the history of Qld democracy. The guy is clueless and busy running the state into a corrupt mess from which it may take decades to recover from. The legal fraternity will take stands against moronic laws and the magistracy has already been corrupted by an appointed Chief Madge who is obviously clueless about the doctrine of the separation of powers. 

The level of interference that is apparent in the meddling than CN is doing is raising eyebrows in all circles. 

The reality of which may lead to a targetted attempt to remove from office an idiot who fails to understand the nuances of a society which is diverse and multicultural.

 Yup he is a Redneck. He may becomes the victim of his own stupidity. I doubt whether he will be there much longer unless he curtails his ambitions to squash all individuals engaging in criminal enterprise. He is likely to bolster corruption in the ranks of the Police by issuing unfettered powers to Qld Police. Just look at our new Federal Health Minister and understand the level of IQ that exists amongst these at times hard working plodders.
I rest the case.

It may be best to see only privateers for a while. Avoiding the shops that have yet to be raided. As I said before the best shops are the ones who have already been raided. Just ask no questions. If you need to see someone at these shops.

Biggus.

Many reasons among them constantly reporting posts, ridiculing members, demands to mods that posts be deleted, abuse of reputation system (caning members such as angleangle &  shaunjohn because they posted stuff he didn't like), but mostly threatening to destroy the forum by inciting factionalism over moderators decisions - usually because the moderators judgement was different to his opinion.

Most of these activities were covert but people may remember how he responded to the Chrissy thread and why his rep was penalised.

He posted some good reviews so it seemed like he was a good member. He was not.

Well, after my session at Nucy massage I had to do something about the hard time Caybee Jr was giving me ,so I visited a couple of shops in the near vicinity of Nucy; had no luck, they were busy and I was running out of time, so off I went to 25' as it was on my way to where I had to be. Rocked in and was greeted by Lucia, she seemed like a nice enough girl ( this proved to be the case): let me say now, she is not an overly attractive girl but this didn't worry me (see reference to Caybee Jr above), so opted for a 1 Hr session. Also thought not so attractive girls tend to put a bit more effort into their work to gain repeat clients.
Into the room (clean, with floor to ceiling walls and lockable door,told to undress etc,did so and was joined a minute or two later by Lucia and on with the massage.Well my thoughts above(re effort) proved to be spot on,her massage turned out to be one of the better ones I've had on the coast (not as good as Nucy),but very good indeed ; she mainly used her forearms,a technique I'm beginning to enjoy, some soft accidental touching happened along the way during the back massage,but nothing serious until after she had wiped me down with the hot towels. WOW,she then started a very light teasing of my back and legs (and other regions) using just her finger tips and fingernails, incredible touch,she continued this for about 10 min with a lot of hand action on Jr. Just about finished me then and there but I managed to hold on. On turn over had a raging mongrel so she went straight to the business, she was extremely proficient in this part of the service as well.Anyway because of my excitement ,due to a combination of Nucy and Lucias excellent work, I'm afraid I didn't last as long as I would have liked . Was cleaned up and told there was still about 10 mins left and would I like a leg and head massage for the remainder, an option I took.Had a cool drink and left super relaxed.
Would I see Lucia again? Yes excellent massage/service.
BTW. was ok to rub legs and bum during,but didn't seem to like breasts touched.(the breasts looked to be about 'B's but could be 'A's due to padding.

Nice review Caybee, but was wondering what you paid for the extra service. I too appreciate a good massage and recently found a lady who uses her forearms too great advantage. Will be heading up that way in a couple of weeks and might pay this place a visit.

Hi Lethal. 
Prices are all inclusive, no extra cost. They also offer a dual massage, I think it's $90.00 hr. This establishment also has another shop at 23 Nind st Southport,(see other post) might also be worth a visit as I think the girls do shifts at both. Cheers..

Service.................................Massage HE. 

Value/Recommend..................In this instance. No, but generally it's a yes/yes.

I stopped into 25 massage again on the above date and was greeted by Angie. I have seen her before at 23 Nind st S'Port. where she was most satisfactory: I have posted a review on that visit (11/12/2013). Any way opted for half hour and was ushered into the room, got the usual instructions to undress etc. Whilst getting my gear off I noticed that the table was covered with a sheet of plastic, anyway I just stood there naked and waited for Angie to return , I was expecting her to bring fresh towels to cover the plastic; she didn't, when I pointed this out she informed me it (the plastic) was because it was for the gel massage,but said I could have oil if I wanted. I thought what the heck, I'll go with the gel. Bad move!! (For me anyway) The gel is very cold and after a couple of minutes I had to ask for the overhead fan to be turned off as I was freezing, on top of that I didn't find the gel anywhere near as pleasurable a sensation as oil. Eventually turn over and onto the business. To me not at all erotic with the gel. It was cold and also I was slipping all over the place on the plastic sheet. As a result I pulled the pin on the HE. A pity because Angie does a really good massage and HE (as I have reviewed). At the beginning she told me the gel wiped off easily. Not so!! I had to have a shower to remove all traces of the stuff. (Luckily they have a shower on the premises).
As I was still feeling toey I took myself off to 36 George st S'Port( I reviewed under- Lilly 36 George St Ph 0422658902) and had the job completed there.
I would return to 25 massage. But not for a gel massage. Others may find it enjoyable, but I certainly didn't.....  This(gel) massage is also offered at their sister shop at 23 Nind St.... It doesn't cost any more than the normal oil massage.

Person's Name : Julie 

Establishment : 25 Massage, 25 Brisbane Road, Biggera Waters, Qld

Date of Visit: 20 Aug 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 5679 8854 or 0447 418 795

Hours of Business: 10am to late,

Rates : Deluxe Massage 30 min - $50; 60 min - $80 (I had the 60 min massage)

Age: Mid 30s+

Size/shape : Nice figure, probably b cup
Nationality or Ethnicity: Korean

Services Provided : Massage with natural gel & HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes  not a bad rub and tug, probably more on offer..
Was on the Gold Coast for a golfing trip and noticed this place on my travels, what took my eye was the sign outside stating "natural gel" used for all massages.
Anyway walk in of the street about 3.00 o'clock in the afternoon and was met by an attractive Thai MILF who turned out to be the mamasan she gave me a menu, I chose my massage, paid the money and was taken to the room which was nice, bright & clean. Once in the room the mamasan told me to undress and then she squirted warm gel on the plastic sheet coated massage table. I get on the table enjoying the feeling of the warm gel on the front side of my body. After a few minutes Julie comes in, a Korean girl who would not win any beauty contests but has a nice figure. She covers my back with a towel cleans my feet with a warm towel and then starts with the firm massage come pummelling on my back, which was very good. After a while she moves the towel down so it covers half my arse and starts massaging with the gel, down the back to the top/ mid-way down my bum, again very enjoyable. Once completed this she removes the towel completely and starts on the legs moving up and down with the gel massage. And yes there were the occasional touches of the boys. At one stage she is massaging around the top of the leg getting right into the crouch area, again extremely enjoyable. She then come back to the back where I start to feel her legs running my hand to her clothed crouch area, she did not pull back. She then asks me to turn over, to be greeted by my fully stiff member. Julie starts massaging my front mainly my belly and lower belly, with the occasional touches to erect member, she then moves to the top of the legs and without asking pours gel on my cock and gives me a great hand job. Meanwhile I was feeling her tits and manage to get one out of the singlet top and bra exposing a very nice nipple.  Once my load has blown she gets a warm towel and thoroughly cleans me up, and then cleans the gel of my front and then does my back.. To finish she gives me a head massage. Please note there was no negotiation the head job was included, although I did tip her $20 as I left as it was a great massage experience.
I do believe there would be more on offer, but as I won't be going back for a while I will let another punter let us know where the limits finish.

Person's Name : Niko

Establishment :25 Brisbane Road Labrador/Biggera
Date of Visit: Early Sept 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 5679 8854 or 0447 418 795

Hours of Business: 10am to late

Rates : $80 for 1 hour

Age: early 30s?

Size/shape : Short, curvy, relatively attractive
Nationality or Ethnicity: Korean or Chinese, not sure

Services Provided : Gel massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Decent.  Pretty typical GC RnT, but don't go just for the gel...

Read with interest about a couple of people getting gel massages here, I've always wanted to try a Nuru Gel massage so figured I'd see what this was about.   Payed the mamasan at the desk for 1 hour with gel ($80), and shown to the room by Niko who was friendly and polite if not a little bit hard to understand with her accent.    Niko grabbed a bottle of gel from a little cabinet warmer on the way in.  
Stripped off and up onto the table to find a rubbery sort of mat which had been pre-covered with gel which is a little bit strange feeling because it was slightly cooler than body temp.  Kind of like laying down in a puddle of lube.  In fact if I had to describe what this massage was like with gel it would be like a massage with a high quality sex lube.  Really slippery and sort of warm feeling when moved around on your skin.
Won't go into super detail, the massage was nice with Niko giving plenty of firm attention to my back, shoulders, and legs.  She climbed on my back at one point and definitely knows how to work her elbows and really strong hands to get some kinks out.  This lady has proper massage skills.  Was hoping she'd climb up on the table naked for some slippery fun but that didn't happen and the atmosphere didn't feel right to ask.  When the turnover came her technique was ok and did the trick.. asked if she took any clothes off but she declined.  After the HJ she applied hot towels to the front and cleaned me up then it was a nice relaxing head massage to wind down followed by some more toweling off.  I didn't find the amount of gel left over afterwards to be too much problem, but I can see if you had to go to work or straight home etc that you might prefer a shower afterwards....

All in all a decent massage but nothing to write home about - this is a gel massage and quite nice, but not really any different from a standard oil massage.

Returned to the Gold Coast for a Christmas break, the ball and chain wanted to go shopping at Harbour Town so I indulged myself just down the road from the shopping complex. Could not resist the Gel massages I had experienced in August.

Anyway arrive mid-afternoon, Nicole was at reception, chose my poison, paid then taken to the room. Undress and wait, in comes Nicole and the massage commences, it is almost a copy of the previous visit. I asked how long Nicole had been working , she said about 4-5 months and she was trained by Julie the previous girl I had, who is the manager apparently. The massage progresses with the occasional touches to all the right areas, this girl is very good at getting all the knots out of your back and legs, she then starts to run her hands under my chest concentrating on my nipples and then heads south and get things good and hard, at which time she asks me to turn over. She then gets on the with normal massage and leave little pounded alone and deflated but alas she then turns her attention to the job in hand, with lots of rubbing in all the right areas to make for a joyful explosion.

I tried to touch Nicole’s legs in the course of the massage but you could see she was not comfortable with this so did not bother after that.

Had a shower after the massage to get rid of any surplus gel, dressed and tipped Nicole $20, which was not asked or requested. All in all a pleasant way to spend an hour…

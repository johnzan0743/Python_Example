Found this in the Courier-Mail under health/beauty services:

"AMAZING Young ladies provide different asian style massage. 80 Dudley St, Annerley  0421 159254"

Large signs outside for health care (not 'massage'), so looks legit. Took the 30 min option for $40 as this was a first time.

Young girl Elaine, Chinese, sz 10, 5'3", pretty face. She was fully rugged up as a cold day in Brisbane today (20 degrees). Says she is a marketing student. English ok, not great.

Took soft massage option, no erotic zones covered at all. So at end of 30 mins was still limp, so I asked about extras. Not from her, she said she would get another girl. I declined. That was it.  Disappointed as I enjoy an erotic massage.

i would like to know more about this place, I have walked in and enquired but got a shy 'no we dont do that' when asked about a sensual massage.

Maybe there is more going on here???

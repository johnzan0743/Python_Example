 My experience/comments : 

I have been a regular at Dominion Rd for a while now but have been getting bored due to lack of new blood/variety. The only other option in the area is the one in Bailey Cres and that's only if you're desperate so was happy when I saw the locanto ad for this new place. Apparently the shop's been open 2 months and pretty easy to find. For the self-conscious, the shop is sandwiched between a Dominos Pizza and a dance academy so may have a lot of foot traffic during the week but pretty quite on the Sunday I was there. The premises is fairly big-ish and clean with rooms with lockable doors although the walls don't go all the way to the ceiling. For today's punt I was allocated Jessica who I'd describe as an average looking MILF but I'm sweet with that. Pricing and service-wise, I'd say it's comparable to Dominion rd but with cleaner surroundings. Jessica's massage was average at best which was acceptable for the price. Despite being my first punt here, I was offered extras so opted for nude+hj and I found this lovely and got the load off satisfactory. All in all, not a bad punt. I found that it had potential and I'm happy for the extra variety of another rnt shop in the Ashmore area.

Nice one.  I saw this ad too, and was very tempted to try it out because it was new.  Among other reasons mentioned in my review, I took the lazy option of 45 Station St because Nerang is more convenient for me.  Good to see a review of this new shop so soon after opening :-)

Sorry, I've only been to this, Dominion and the one in Bailey Cres. I've not been to the Nerang one's as it's too out my commute route. I got a MILF when I was there but did notice younger girls there and Dominion's texted me that they have a new roster but I haven't been there to confirm it.

Both times I've been to Ellys at 31 Station St they've had nice pretty young girls on, but I'd recommend either of the two on Station St if you're just in the market for a very typical Asian massage parlour experience. Doubles are pretty good value too if that's your thing.

I haven't been to Dominions Rd for a while but that was always pretty good too. I've been offered more options there  but the ladies tended to be bit older... though not as old as at Baileys Crs.

Back out for another punt today after my lay off. I had seen this shop advertised somewhere a couple of months ago, I think they advertised as a new shop then. Anyway as I was out and about I thought I'd give them a go. When I first entered I was greeted by a young girl of about 24-25,(sorry, didn't get her name)ok build sporting a pair of 'C' or 'D' cups, face was ok but nothing to write home about. Got some details and said I would prob return a bit later. I checked out a couple of other places: nothing suited so I returned about 30 mins later. On entering this time I was greeted by a skinny older woman of about 40-45 Yrs. Asked about the 1st girl I had seen and was told I would have to wait 10 mans or so. I was contemplating this when out came Jessica, I thought she looked ok so I asked if she would do the massage, she said yes,so fixed her up for 1 hr ($50) and was taken into the room. They have 5 rooms in total, all with walls that don't quite reach the ceiling, they miss by about 1/2 a metre. She left me to get undressed and hop up onto the table,she returned about 2 mins later and the action began. She didn't ask what pressure I would like, just started in with a medium pressure which I was quite happy with, in fact I found her technique and pressure very enjoyable. During the proceedings she was kind of pushing her upper thighs against my elbows and arms; I found this to be somewhat erotic and and promised of more pleasure to come. I also took this as a sign to become a little more adventurous myself, so I then slid my hand up her leg and under her shorts(lovely soft legs), to my (pleasant)surprise I discovered she wash"t wearing any knickers underneath and was quite wet. She then started in on the tease,it was magic.She continued with the tease for another 3 or 4 mins, by which time I was sporting a bone a dog couldn't chew and was raring to go. I turned over, she put the question, as if it wasn't obvious. I started in rubbing her pussy under her shorts, she then asked if I wanted her nude...Yes..Yes..Yes...Cost an extra $50. but in my eyes, worth it. Gave a bit of a body to body, cuddling,kissing and lots of pussy play and tit sucking(by me). My God she was wet, she had to stop occasionally to wipe her pussy. Anyway after about 5 mins of this activity I was on my back for the finale;lasted only about 1min after all the foreplay, but well worth it.She got a wet towel and cleaned my mess up, then, to my surprise she got down and started wiping the floor where she had been standing. I can only think she was dripping wet and made a bit of a mess. It wouldn't surprise me as she seemed to be very turned on by the going ons.
All in all, a very satisfying experience. I would recommend her to all and sundry.
Would I return?? Yes...Yes...Yes.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage. HE

Value for money/recommend? : Yes/ yes not too bad

My experience/comments :......... Wanted to try an older Cauc lady whom I've had on my bucket list of a while. Unfortunately she wasn't responding to my calls,so, with little time left available to satisfy my desires I headed off to Miss Wongs where I knew I would leave having achieved the desired results . Candy responded to my ringing of the bell, (on counter) she informs me she is available immediately, so Into the room, got a hug and told to undress etc which I duly did. after a minute another girl knocks, enters and informs me Candy will be another 5mins; looks like she wasn't immediately available,didn't bother me too much so said ok and waited. After 5 mins she comes in, gives me another hug and thanks me for waiting she then starts the massage; after asking soft, med or light?(once again opted for med to light). the massage wasn't too bad, although I probably wouldn't call it a massage as such; more like a body rub leaning toward a massage; not unenjoyable at all.Anyway this proceeds for 30 mins or so with no sign of any tickle in the nether regions:. She completes the massage, wipes the excess oil off(not that there was an awful lot)then starts with a very erotic soft touch running of her fingertips over my entire back and,thankfully, the areas that matter most (I think this is what's called a butterfly massage). This went on for quite some time till I was hard as a rock.She then asked me to turn over and to my surprise continued the same treatment on my front. a little bit more of this then on with the business. I started rubbing her pussy outside her underwear. She then asked me if I would like them removed.(Silly question) Was informed it would cost an extra redback, I must have hesitated as she then came down to $10. Ok. So off with the knickers and on with the deed. She didn't mind my touching  the muff(hairy) or rubbing the clit (gently), but backed away a little if I tried to insert a digit. Eventually the deed was done. she cleaned me up and finished the massage till my hour was up. A pleasant touch at the end was, she covered my feet with what looked like a teatowel and gave me a 3or 4 min foot massage...I quite enjoyed this little touch.               
When asked, she told me that Jessica had left and no longer works there..

Person's Name : Elly

Establishment : Suzie Wongs Beauty Treatment

Date of Visit : 19/04/15

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 4/115 Currumburra Rd Ashmore. Ph.0405 125704

Hours of Business : 9am to late - 7 days

Rates : Std Gold Coast rates - $30/50 for 30/60mins. Dual option etc.

Age : Mid twenties?

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Not bad, had better

Pretty standard Asian RnT experience - not much to report.  Elly is a young HAB with a nice sexy demeanor.  I wasn't really in any doubt about whether a tug was going to be on offer.  Elly's English is very good which she used to make general conversation during the start of the massage.  To be honest I'm not really a fan of chit chat during a massage, but to her credit, the chit chat stopped after about 3-4 mins.

Massage was OK, but not outstanding.  She definitely has some massage skills, but I've had better, and it really felt like we were just going through the motions to get to the main event. Not much in the way of a tease while laying face down.  Rolled onto my back and the towel was very loosely laid over my dick, but it didn't stay there for long when she started lightly rubbing around my groin area.  With one hand on my dick and the other holding up 2 fingers, I gave the nod and she oiled me up and started the main event.  Pretty ordinary tug to be honest, but it did get me over the line.  Elly then went off to get a wet towel, did a pretty crappy cleanup , and it was all over.

While getting dressed I noticed I was still REALLY oily "down there".  I didn't want any baby oil smells on my undies, so I grabbed the towel off the table and used it to clean up properly.  I left the towel all scrunched up so it was obvious I'd used it, so hopefully it didn't just get adjusted for the next punter.  Either way, I'm sure we've all shared a towel or two in these places over the years - yuck!

So that's that.  Pretty average, so I doubt I'll be rushing back any time soon.  Can't complain too much for $50, but I am finding it hard to convince myself that it's great value compared to what you can get for a little extra at a private.  Actually just thinking about it now, I think the trick at these places is to go for an hour so there's enough time to get a fair amount of actual massage done before the HE - or have the HE done in the middle of the massage as is my favorite option, so I can lay back and relax fully after the "stress relief".  That said, I'm still a bit freaked out that I might get caught with my pants down in a police raid, so my preference is still for a pvt.

 My experience/comments : 

I’m starting to really like this place and I don’t think I’m the only one. Their aggressive price-points have made them pretty busy that the last couple of times I visited they had to down-grade my session to only 30 minutes because they were inundated with punters. Unlike Pacific Massage, they seem to have a lot of girls ranging from 20’s to 40’s and the overall quality of thier massage is also a little better. I’ve seen Isabella twice now and the service quality remained consistent. She’s got a nice MILF figure which is always a plus in my book. I would classify her technique more relaxing than therapeutic but it suited my purposes. The tease and second part of the session was ok, not the best but adequate and I got my rocks off. I did find this part a little detached and I think this is where it pays to build rapport with a regular ML. I would try her again.

My experience/comments : 
It's been over a year since I been to Suzie Wong's as I just been sticking to my regs in Hicks street. I really should have just gone with my regs but I wanted some variety. Too bad it was a dud this time around but that's punting for ya. I rocked up early in the arvo and the shop was pretty quiet and I was met by Candy who was the only one available. Candy wasn't the prettiest face but her figure was still decent and she was friendly. In my experience, I always allow some flexibility with a ML's looks as I'm more after good technique and experience. The mature one's can sometimes surprise but alas, Candy wasn't one of them. I think I've been spoilt from Hick St's Wendy with her firm hands that Candy's technique was well below baseline quality. It was ok, not great...mediocre. I did enjoy part 2 as she did spend some time teasing and getting me hot well before the turn-over which is something a lot of girls half-heartedly do. I should've gone with my instincts and had a HE as I think she would've been good at that. Alas, she offered BJ and I couldn't refuse and it was....just ok. How I miss a really skilled cock sucker. Maybe I just went to Suzie Wong's at a bad time or maybe the overall quality has dipped but the whole experience was a tad mediocre.

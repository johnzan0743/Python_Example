The SeaRay's are going to PORT DOUGLAS for some bonding (which will take about 3 minutes) after 34 years of blissful marriage, looking at the Tripadvisor, there appears to be many straight legit massage spas, but has any body visited any naughty sexy RnT's in Port Douglas I could sneak out to visit ???????????

Hey SR my neighbours (a couple of them) are currently in Port Douglas on holidays. Tell you what I'll give his Missus a ring and you can go and get some from her but I must warn you she is really mature. Hmm on second thoughts I'll ask her 40+ daughter to see if she cannot assist you they are on holidays with the family from all states of this Island. just a thought! . 


Biggus.

It's almost 6.30, the Taxi to take us to the Airport will be here at any tick now, I noticed Mrs SeaRay went to the Asian Beauty Shop yesterday to have her Finger & Toe Nails done and her 59 year Pussy waxed, so the Marital Bonding in Port Douglas should now take 5 minutes and with a week in the Sun, surely there will be some dodgy little Asian Massage place open up there....cheers SR

My experience/comments : I have visited Sammy many times at Pure Massage, and was relieved to get a text to say they were operating again after a recent move.  The shop is still needing some bits and pieces but I'm sure they will get there.  But I'm not there to visit the shop.  Sammy does a excellent massage, whether in the mood for hard or just a tickle, both styles have just the right amount of lead up action, so when time to flip, it is pretty much straight into the ending.  I find her techniques to be very good, with no rush.  She seems to like to keep you on the edge and she decides when you will finish.  Would I return, yes and have many times over the last 12 months

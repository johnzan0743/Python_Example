This is my second time lucky in a shopping centre, massages are so insanely rare to snag with extras inside shopping complexes.
I got a rough idea that this one might be dodge when I was seeing men going in looking over their shoulders, appearing slightly paranoid of who might be watching.
So I followed suite, went in and picked the only girl available Christine. I Requested a full body massage.
I got taken to the massage room and left alone to get ready, I quickly stripped down to my undies and laid down. She returned and the massage commenced as usual.. At around the 40 minute mark she had me roll over and said 'Anything make you happy?'
I gestured towards my soldier, she said '$50'. I paid.
She didn't have any oil or lube to use, so it was a little rough but she had a good technique. Her body wasn't that amazing so I didn't ask for anything else (touching etc).

I squirted and she cleaned me up with a towel that looked like it had been dragged out of a cum covered hell.. but otherwise a reasonable R&T.

My experience/comments :

Saw this add so thought I would take one for the team. Shop been open for 1 month , new fit out with walls to the ceiling with solid doors.

Name sort of looks familiar but claims owner does not have other shops and girls are new to industry here at least.

So took the 30 min relaxation option as it was cheaper than deep tissue and whole body. Thought I was going to get a sensual massage but no a nice sort version of a decent therapeutic. Skills were really good and thorough, a little touching of her legs with her permission was ok but no venturing.

Things were going good so she asked if I wanted more time so went to 45 min and everything was so thorough with no accidental touching and at about 30 min mark I was starting to wander if.............. I had been communicating with her all along so asked if I could turn over and she agreed and went and got a hot towel as I was getting oil as well.

Cleaned back and legs and turned over then she turned the light out. Okkkkkkkkkkk. She then oiled her hands and straight to the manly area with nice play around the area. At this point I asked if does anything more but no top off and really shy at this point. Now for a new girl she had a really good slow technique and even included a cork screw action just like Elly.

So very enjoyable and while talking to her all the time she asked me to come back so I suggested next time I take an hour and would like to massage her to which she seemed happy and not hesitant to accept.

So who knows !!!!!!!!. Not the best but a good first visit I say. Usually 4 girls on mainly from Taiwan and will check it out again.

My experience/comments : 

Out and about again yesterday, so decided to have a little relaxation therapy. I had seen this place reviewed so thought I would give it a go. Parking can be difficult; it's only 15min limit in front of the block of shops in which they are located. However parking can be found in the street behind (Surf Pde.),there is a walkway through to their area, so it's not a long walk.
When I called in there was only Miu on the desk, she informed me the other masseuse was busy but she was available..I thought, why not, as some of the less attractive girls can provide some of the best experiences. I opted for the 1/2 hr option to test the waters. She led me into the room to get ready then left for a couple of minutes whilst I was doing so. The room was a reasonable size,clean, with walls that go right to the ceiling and a lockable door;looking good
After I was undressed and on the table she reentered and began the massage. I had opted for the medium to soft treatment and she didn't disappoint, the massage was quite good and relaxing, unfortunately there was no grazing,touching or tease of any sort: either accidental or otherwise. she continued on till the turn over; where I hoped things might liven up a little, but, no go. We were about 25mins into proceedings when I was informed she only provided massage and another girl would finish off. Switcheroos are a no no for me, so I politely declined. As it turned out the other girl was busy again by this time. I don't know just how they would have worked it had I accepted. Maybe a back and forth shuffle between the girls and rooms..
Anyway, to finish off not a bad massage, so was happy with that. She did inform that there would be an extra girl working to-morrow(today), so it wouldn't be so difficult. she also told me (when asked) the tip for HE was $20.
I will probably try here again in the future (I'm not in the Broadbeach area that often.)
As for the unfinished business I headed of down the highway to try my luck elsewhere. More to follow.

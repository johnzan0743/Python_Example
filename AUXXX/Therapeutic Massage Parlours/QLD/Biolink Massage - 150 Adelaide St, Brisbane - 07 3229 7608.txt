My experience/comments : 
This place is behind the internet cafe.  You can pay for the massage using eftpos at the internet cafe after you have had the discussion on how long you want with the massure.

The first time i went the massage was pretty good and the girl did a great job.  However when i went back the massage was pretty ordinary and and the girl just did some weird moves on my back and then flipped me over for a quick rub of my legs.  She then spoke in chineese and left the room.  Another ladycame back and asked me if i wanted more and then said $50.  I said it was too much and the price was negotiated down to $40, but it was not worht that at all.

I was left to clean the oil off myself after she was done.

I think as with all of these places, it is pot luck if you get a decent massage.

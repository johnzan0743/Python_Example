My experience/comments :  Finally took the punt and visited Sunshine Massage after reading many reviews on other sites.  Was paired up with a cute little pocket rocket Kyoko.  Wow is all I have to say, it was not much about the massage but more about keeping me hard and on the edge for a good 45 minutes.  Price wise, cost a extra $100 but 1/2 an hour in if she said it was another 500 I would of happily paid.  Highly recommend.

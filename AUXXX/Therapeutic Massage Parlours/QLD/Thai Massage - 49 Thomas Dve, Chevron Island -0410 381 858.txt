My experience/comments: The parlour only had the 1 girl when I went and she appeared a bit snooty from the beginning however I did put this down to the fact the a massage parlour in Ferry Road (which is pretty close) was closed down recently after the Gold Coast Bulletin did a front page article that many of the massage parlours were a front for prostitution. I any event she showed no surprise when I got naked and proceeded to do a very legit massage. I asked her to get her tits out but she acted like she never understood English. I then gestured by tugging at her top but she then got offended and I was very pissed off.
I left feeling highly frustrated by this experience especially when they come up with a name like Thai massage ffs!!

Appears to have closed down now. 
I see that there is a Yes Massage Parlour on the ground floor and wondered if anyone has has any luck / info in regard to this place. I went in and tried to find out how far they are prepared to go but they gave away nothing so I left.

I can tell you all that Yes massage is completely legit. I go there for a proper massage. Been many times, and it's just not a RnT. Same as the shop in surfers. Actually, funny... Last time I was there getting a massage I heard some geezer come in and ask questions... Like "do you do stress relief" the answer was a very firm "NO"

My experience/comments : I satisfied my curiosity..

Headed out Wednesday with the intention of trying my luck at Thai Orchid; the shop I mentioned in my review of FantAsia..On my way I had to make a stop at Chevron Island..During this stop I decided to leave Thai Orchid for another day and try Yes Massage. I had seen them a while ago and put them on my "to try" list.. I had noticed they had been reviewed before (last time 19/11/2012.) where it was said they were a legit shop, but, as that was  two and a half years ago I was hoping things might have changed.. Anyway, when I entered I was met by Jai: I indicated I wanted the $50. 50 min whole body massage and was taken to the work area.( there is only three tables and these are separated only by curtains.) I was then told to undress but to leave my underwear  on..Oh well!! It was only a punt after all.. 
I went through with the massage, which was quite good, firm, but relaxing; no accidental brushes; nothing erotic at all...She did my neck,back, shoulders and legs for the duration of the massage: she then said the session was over...I felt somewhat ripped off, as on their price list they these areas listed as $40 40 mins and the $50 option as full body (back and front I would have imagined.)
Anyhow, in conclusion: I won't be returning as I can get a decent legit closer to home if I'm in need....Also, her attitude was somewhat cold and not very friendly... It was like she knew what I really wanted and just wanted to get me out of there...

$65 for half an hour is a lot. If you just wanted a massage, Amore is just around the corner and is $65 an hour. And I thought that was overpriced (mostly because of the extra $50 for the T).

So, I went past, because it's close. The place is called "Healing Hands Thai Massage". Their website is healinghandsthaimassage.com. It has a lot of stuff on it about the different types of massage they offer, spa treatments, etc. Everything about it suggests it's a legit massage place, not for "our type".

Prices on the website don't show for half an hour:

60/90/120 min      $89/$129/$178

$89 an hour, probably no pop. Definitely not my kind of place!

My experience/comments : 

Ok so was gonna have a punt at sunshine however felt lazy so decided to try this place since it's only a short drive. Rocked up no booking and I gotta say this shop looked really nice, saw a sign said come
Back in 30 mins. So I came back and was greeted by a young girl. Ask for her name and said " cara". Look wise I'd say she's a plain Jane, not attractive but not soo unattractive. Neways was desperate so I stayed for 30 mins. She took me on the room and told me she be back. She then was on the phone to another worker for about 6 mins then had another call 5 mins to a punter whom she told to come by in 20 mins. She finnaly came in and after an average massage it was obviously very rushed cause there was another punter waiting. No teasing and on the flip asked if I wanted extras I offered 30 which was a no go. I was gonna bail but felt desperate so settled with 40. Hj was ok got the job done a bit mechanical but good enough she also allowed me to touch her. I think she must of short timed me 10 mins. Neways on the way out saw a suss punter waiting in the car.

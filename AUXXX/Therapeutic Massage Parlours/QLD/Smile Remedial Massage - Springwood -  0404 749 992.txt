Saw the shop while driving past and went back a few days later, as it was close and i was short on time. This shop has a very ugly street front, in an older strip of shops. The Name is in big red and black lettering with just Remedial Massage showing. You enter into a large room with a big black L shape lounge with two Asian girls, probably late teens reading in the sunlight. I was shown a menu of services which included a Duo massage (don't remember the pricing) and a few other options but i didn't see it long enough to take it all in.

Went for an hour massage and was asked if i had been here before...the room had walls to the ceiling and door locks, a flat screen tv (not on) and a 2 seater couch. As i stripped down, i saw a big notice on the wall that they do not provide sexual services. Which on this occasion was very accurate. Sherri wasn't much of a talker but her english was ok. Nothing sensual , a couple of definate accidental scrotum touches on the clean up. A handtowel kept the bits covered on the turnover. The massage was pretty good  8/10

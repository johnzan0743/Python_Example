My experience/comments : First visit here and the girl i got was just new to industry. Beautiful looking girl with aubin hair in long plats. pleasant personality and chatty. Was going great guns with massage so extended to hr for $60. She is a student of thai massage from mamsan and started well. Asked for firm and finish with sensual. She got a little lost after half way mark and seems her routine only lasts 30 min so started repeating her routine at this point as if to be filling in time. At the 40 min mark after no hint of accidental touching was asked to turn over and she was hiding behind towel which she was holding up in front of her. Well that told a story and then whispered she would get some else in. OK so in came a young thai girls. Thin and was going to finish off. She asked if massage was ok and told her not experienced and had no massage on front and that thai massage was attempted but not so good. OK was the reply so she did the front part of massage for 15min or so which was very expert and led onto this finale. At this stage my previous disappointment was being over shadowed by a very enjoyable slow Hj. Took awhile to finish but this girl had good technique and finally unloaded. She explained best to book boss lady if want genuine thai massage and will certainly return for that. Was there for more than an hr and not time watching and will return. They hsve a collection of nationalities working here who are all new.

[COLOR=#333333]Value for money/recommend? : being a 2nd timer, ive learnt from reading on forums that saying that you've been there before definately helps, haha. I walked in and got greeted by the masaman (boss lady). and asked how are you, how many time you been now, i relplied with a few haha, and went with the half hour option. girl in her 20's walked out. alright on the eyes and looked to have nice set of real tits, took me to the room which was kinda clean.. undressed and she returned and gave me the usual bullshit rub on the back and asked me whether ive been with her before and i replied no (never say no) ive learnt that now. so then she asks me to turn over and the usual rub and then points to the little fella asking if i wanted that to be massaged too. i obviously replied yes and she said 30 dollar tip ok? and i gave in at my weakest point... nice hj, but then when i went to get a bit of tit action she said no and maybe next time... urrrgghhhh haha, blew within a few minutes and got cleaned up nd got out of dodge... 60 dollars for a hj with no tits or anything, duno if thats a good deal or not really?

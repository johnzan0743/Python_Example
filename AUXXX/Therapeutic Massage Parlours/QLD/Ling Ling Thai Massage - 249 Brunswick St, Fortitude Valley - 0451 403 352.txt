My experience/comments: I have been to see May twice, and had an excellent experience both times due to the quality of the massage and the attitude of the staff.  

She has a very good and firm massage technique that leaves me feeling invigorated.  The massage goes the full length of time, works all muscle groups (except the chest for some reason I dont know), and finishes with a warm towelling to remove the oil (it has a medium strength scent, so I recommend asking to get towelled off twice if that matters to you)

There are no extras available according to the website, which says:  "We are all professionally trained masseurs and do not offer sexual services so its not that sort of happy ending!"

This matches my experience with May.  She teases a little bit, but you get the clear sense that it wont go anywhere beyond her giving you a little hug or kiss at the end.  I was able to rub my hand along her arms and legs, but got a playful slap when my hand wandered to her butt....heh!

The parlour is one medium sized room with 3 cubicles separated by a couple layers of sheer curtains.  The ML's all walk between the cubicles if they go to get more towels or oil or whatever, and they do chatter a bit in Thai (I never know if they are commenting on my small pecker or not)  Anyway, this means there is no real privacy for anything more than a straight massage.

I would recommend a visit to see May if you are after a good quality massage and a friendly interaction with someone who enjoys their work.

My experience/comments:
There use to be a place up the stairs at 119 scarborough st advertised as "Chinese Massage", with pretty much just a single room and a single Chinese lady. Well they moved across to a bigger room, and they now have several thai-style cubicles. The place is run by both a Thai lady and the Chinese lady. From what I could gather, the Thai lady was legit and didn't do extras. So I was shown to a cubicle by Ms China and then she left, and came back while I was still undressing (I prefer them to stay in the room.. what is with girls who always leave the room?). She was pretty jovial from the get-go, asking if I had a lady back home, occasionally stroking the big boy in a not-so-subtle way. Flipped over, and asked if I wanted to pay for extras. Took her up on the offer of $20 (although for the benefit of fellow punters and keeping prices low in our local area I really should start trying to negotiate a $15 or even a $10).

Plus side: I like the establishment. As it's new, it has a kind of "fresh" feel to the linen and all. Although the room itself is your typical ageing two-storey Southport office block. Ms China isn't herself boasting in the attractiveness, but she does do reasonable business.

I noticed a few mobile phones on the desk, so they seem to have numbers setup. But I forgot to ask as I left. I'll keep your price in mind if I head there again.. don't know why I had $65..

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RNT(tip for relief)

My experience/comments : Decided to visit this place again as I enjoyed my previous session and $55 for an hour is a pretty sweet price. It had been a couple weeks since my previous visit and they finally sorted out their signage, contact details and business cards. Seemed to be a busy Sunday arvo and was told to wait for 10 minutes at the reception. All the pictures of Thai Royalty and other paraphernalia really gives the place a legit feel although I thought it bothering on overkill. Anyway, first one to finish was Lily so went with her once again. She's not a looker and has that plain housewife look to her but for me it's all about the service. Massage provided was very satisfactory with all the knots sorted out. Tickle tackle and bum tease was very nice and I especially enjoyed the happy ending with her playing with my nipple and balls while tugging me(strange that most girls don't put that little extra effort). I finished the session quite spent and relaxed. Lily may not be a looker but she's quite good at her job. Will return. Final damage was $80 for the whole session.

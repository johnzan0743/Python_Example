Size/shape: Size 12, busty, about 5'5

Nationality or Ethnicity: French (here for another couple of months then returning to Belgium)

Services Provided: Full body massage

Value for money/recommend?: Yes

My experience/comments: I found the ad for this place in the CM:  "Zorro massage center grand open. Relax full body pretty multinat duo eftpos a/c rear parking 7 days-late 571 Old Cleveland Rd 38433380"  However, the center does not have "Zorro" written anywhere that I could see.  Instead it is "I Love Massage/ Mo Zhi Massage"  Sandra told me that they have been open for a few years as far as she knew.  She said that she thinks they are opening another store in the city so maybe that is what the ad is referring to (on their business card they already have two other locations: 2/554 Lutwyche Road, Lutwyche and 1034 Logan Road, Holland Park)

Anyways.....  

The center has good parking at the rear, which is important in the hilly streets of Camp Hill where there are no parks on the street for miles.  The house is an old queenslander style that looks to be in very good condition, and the whole center was nice and clean throughout.  There is a rear entrance up the steps, where the sign says to ring the bell and come in.  I was met by Sandra, who is a young French girl with a very pretty face, ample bosom, and a nice curvy figure.  There was another girl there, an Asian girl that appeared to be Japanese.  Sandra told me that there are 3 girls that work there.  As I got a bit lost on the way to the center I was only able to take the 30 minute option for $40.  Sandra led me to the room and told me to take all my clothes off (I love it when girls say that to me  )

She came back a few minutes later to give me the massage.  I have to tell you guys, it was great!  She asked me if I wanted oil, asked me if I want soft, medium, or hard, and checked on me throughout the 30 minutes.  She struugled a little bit with english but tried very hard to understand what I was saying.  Her massage was a bit teasy and stirred me a little bit.  She did some lovely work on my inner thighs, so that when she told me to roll over I was semi rigid.  She gave my chest and nipples a lovely rub, and did the same on my lower belly and thighs again.  I was very tempted to ask her if she offered extras, and have a good feeling the answer would have been yes.  But for some reason I held back and didnt pluck up the courage to ask (maybe she was too pretty for me, or as I had already had a HJ at Arowana earlier that day I didnt think I could go again)

After the massage was over she asked me if I wanted to shower.  She led me to the clean bathroom, and I showered in great hot water and body wash.  After I had dressed again she gave me a card with her name written on it, and asked me to come again soon, and she had a very cute little smirk on her face.  I will be back.....for sure.....and this time I will be bolder!

Fingers crossed!

Indeed!

Excellent review Quivver, please do let us know if "extras" are on the table. 

I think the fact that they offer "duo" options makes this a good prospect....!

Brisbane really lacks the kind of R&T places Sydney has, I would love it if King's Court opened a franchise up here, but this might be a great alternative!

Dawn - French/Sri Lankan ML

Visited today. Had been told by phone that the French/Belgian girl Sandra was off today, but they had another French girl Dawn.

Large signs in the front yard of this Queenslander house, so easy to spot. Up the back stairs, there were 3 girls, 2 Asians and a dark Indian looking girl. This was the French lady Dawn, has Sri Lankan parentage. I thought I was in for a daily double - Indian looking girl and French accent. Way to go. She is I guess mid 20s, dark skin, size 8.

She took me to a room after I had paid the $40 for half hour. As reported, house and rooms clean. Told to strip off and then onto the massage table.

She starts a very professional massage (I guess she has done this in France) while we chat. She is backpacking with her girlfriend (who I guess is the other girl Sandra). She said she is finishing next week to start touring for 5 months.

Massage continued while I gained more intel, she works here Mon to Wed, and on Thurs at their Holland Park shop (says the boss has 3 shops, mentioned above).

Continued with a long back massage (can you guess what is going to happen here?), then plenty of time on the legs but no high inner thigh action - so no 'accidental' touching, nothing erotic, no tackle tickle.

After what I guess to be 30 minutes, she says "would you like a shower?"  I am a bit stunned, as there was no whate we always like to hear "turn over now", and I ask "are we finished?". Yes. Straight legit massage, with me lying on the front for the whole session.  

So into the shower to get off the oil. Then dress, say "au revoir" and out the back door.

So, what did I get for my $40?  A very good massage, no doubt, for I guess the full 30 minutes, with a nice girl. No eroticism, so I doubt this girl is into RnT.  I struck out here with extras.  Anyone else want to take up the challenge?

Thanks for the recon job Lightning, I was planning on a run myself but the job's got me out west for the next couple of weeks.

By the sounds of it this place probably runs as a legit massage joint but may cast a blind eye to any "extras" the girls get up to on their own. Hopefully Sandra is up for "extras" but if they are both going on tour in a couple I weeks I have probably missed the boat by the time I'm back. 

Still, would be great to get confirmation on Sandra if anyone else in the neighbourhood wants to continue the challenge...

@ lightning....
Thanks for TOFTT mate.  Sorry that it didn't work out with Dawn (and that Sandra was AWOL)  A question: when Dawn said she was Sandra's 'girlfriend', did you get the sense that this was platonic or sexual?  This might be an indicator on why no extras from her?  What do you think?

@ wolthelb....
I think your evaluation is fairly spot on, this being a legit massage joint with a blind eye turned if the ML does the occasional extra.  Hope you find some action out west while you are working

Well, there was a duo option mentioned earlier so perhaps things would get interesting if you had them both in the same room together. 

As for the western action... probably not likely. The nearest major would be a couple of hours to Longreach and I don't know if the action there is any good.

Matt, I think they are just backpackers and she did not explicitly say her girlfriend was Sandra - I am just assuming this, both being French.

As for any lesby-friend doubles, I think that would just be a figment of our imaginations - this place just looked too straight - but am willing to be proved wrong !!

Person's Name: Megan

Establishment : I love massage / zorro massage

Date of Visit: Sat 28 May 2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 571 Old Cleveland Road, Camp Hill QLD 4152 - 07 3843 3380

Hours of Business: 7 days till late

Rates: $40 for half hour or $60 for one hour

Age: early 20's

Size/shape: tall slim maybe b-cup

Nationality or Ethnicity: Asian

Services Provided: massage with R & T

Value for money/recommend?: yes

My experience/comments:  Rocked up last Sat night (I had earlier rand and made an appt) wondering if this place would deliver. Well I wasn't disappointed. Was greeted by Megan at the back door. Impressed straight off. Lovely young lady with a quirky sense of humour and attractive features. 

I said to her it was my first time here and straight up asked her if extras were on offer. I got a YES, but it's $50. (so all up $90) A bit steep compared to some other places. Luckily I had the extra $50. Lots of gentle touching plus she is afully qualified masseuse so if you want a therapeutic massage plus a R&T she's the right girl. I must say though she does provide an awesome R&T. It's a bit different to some girls who just make you spill ya load way too early. 

Anyway I will be back, and might even try asking some of the other girls in the establishment for extras.  MF

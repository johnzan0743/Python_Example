Establishment : Soung Nuii Thai Massage

Date of Visit : 23th May 2012

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 07 31133149 - 5/144 Adelaide St, Brisbane (Rear access via laneway from Anne St)

Hours: ?

Rates : $60 /hr

Name: Candy

Age : 22 she told me

Size/shape : short and slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : HJ & clothes off (paid extra $40)

Value for money/recommend? : yes

My experience/comments : 
Apparently only Candy's second day of work in this shop. Massage 5/10, looks 8/10, good English, body 8/10, HJ 6/10. Didn't object to external touching. Friendly girl who relaxes more as the massage goes on. Was very chatty by the time we finished. Shop struggles to keep staff and has been closed for periods for his reason according to ML. Candy currently working most days, but will reduce to 3 days a week if short on customers. Suspect that a lot more in the way of extras would be available from Candy if you became a regular. I will return simply to see what Candy will offer on a second visit.

This is in the wrong section, as it's a massage place. That said... $60 for a R&T in the city? With the one I liked gone legit this is pretty appealing.

I tried to pop in today around lunch time but it was not open. It is a public holiday today so thats fair enough. It looked open though with lights on but the door was locked. Maybe she was out to lunch.

Yes sure is. Someone also mentioned a rear entrance through a lane way as well for those who want to be discrete. However the arcade entrance is fine because there are a lot of other shops in the arcade.

Establishment : Soung Nuii Thai Massage

Date of Visit : yesterday

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 07 31133149 - 5/144 Adelaide St, Brisbane (Rear access via laneway from Anne St)

Hours: ?

Rates : $40 / 30min

Name: don't know, didn't ask

Age : 50's?

Size/shape : stout

Nationality or Ethnicity : Brazilian?

Services Provided : Massage only

Value for money/recommend? : no

My experience/comments : 
I walked in and was met by an attractive young maybe Brazilian girl. She led to the the table took my money and left the room, then in comes her much older and less attractive but not completely unattractive mum I'm guessing. At this point I was not even going to ask for anything other than massage.
Massage was ok except for interruptions and some back and forth banter in spanish? with people outside the room, I wasn't offered a towel either which was a bit odd, just laid there starkers on the table for back massage in a room that was just a bit cold for a massage then asked to roll over for a front massage and not erotic by any stretch of the imagination. I will not be back.
I dunno, maybe they thought I was a cop sporting a short haircut and brought in their anti-cop masseuse.

Establishment :As Tiltle

Date of Visit:Friday 15th June 2012

Hours of Business: 9am til 6pm

Rates: $60 hour + $40 extras

Age: early/mid 20s

Size/shape: 10

Nationality or Ethnicity: Australian

Services Provided:Massage Swedish

Value for money/recommend?: Massage yes, HJ no

My experience/comments: 

Went in, greeted by friendly australian girl.  Asked for one hour thai massage and was shown to room where she said she said strip down and get on table.  Started off well, I asked where she learnt to give thai massage and she said I give swedish only?  It was a good swedish massage then, no tackle tickle but she preferred me without towel on so toward end I asked if extras were on offer and she obliged with a oily tug declining to get her nice breasts out.  She said she works part time and there was someone else working that day with her but it is quiet.
Looks 6/10.  Massage 7/10.  HJ 5/10.  As I was getting dressed she walked in as I was getting money to give her, she saw me putting 10 away and she grabbed it making $40 most expensive handy anywhere in the world!  I'm not going to bemoan $10 but then i am a kiwi and that was a pretty average slippery service seeing others paid $40 for nude or box.  Guess results vary on the day and this is the beauty of punting

Hey tried this place on friday 17 th of Jan 2013.  Hot little Thai girl but no result.  I pointed and she said she doesn't do it but some girls will.

I will try again at $60 for an hour massage not too bad.

Don't get me wrong guys I thought the outcome was horse shit.  I ended up $60 poorer with a case of blue balls.  Nothing worse than shelling out cash then having to take matters into your own hands.  Just wanted to report back to everyone hence the message.

Girl: not sure but definitely Brazilian. 

Value for money: no. $60 I think.

Experience: 

The massage was well below average. I jumped on the table nude and maybe this scared the ML off? She didn't ask about type of massage.

I like firm and she gave a light massage. It finished early. It was probably the worse massage ever received and also had a case of blue balls. 

I will not be going back.

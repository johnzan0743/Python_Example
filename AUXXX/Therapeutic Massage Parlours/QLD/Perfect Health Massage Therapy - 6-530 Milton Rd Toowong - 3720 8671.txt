Emma is pretty hot. She's got that Korean look of slender and tall (for an Asian girl, but not really tall).


She's been well-trained in the massage trade, as she does deliver an excellent massage. Identified some tight knots and worked them hard.


Definitely left with a spring in my step.

I thinks a visit to one of these Asian RnT places is on the cards, been a while since I have partaken in such "not to sure what you get" massage.

 RNT in Southport
				
Post Content: 
Just wondering, does anyone have any other intel on other rnt places in southport? I know of/frequented 172 scarborough st, Amity thai and also seen privates Angel and Angel-li. I have also been to Sapa Massage(Railway st) and achinese lady who works in scarborough upstairs from the indian restaurant but they seem to legit and no fun time offered. There's a few more massage around the area but haven't been to them. Anyone else tried these places or have other recommendations?

Massage Centre, Shop 4, 106 Bundall Rd, Bundall  0424 071347

Bundall is not all that far away from Southport - just across Chevron Island.

I saw in The Bulletin an ad for a "new asian massage" place, no address but the phone number. I am looking out for "new" ads in case Ping opens up again, having sold out of 172 Scarborough.

Lady says 4 girls on, opened last week, $40 30mins, so I guess with tug at $20 that gives the going rate of $60.

Get around there, only one oldish ML on, 40s, not all that appealing. Went into a room, large and private, no shower. She says other ladies be 5 minutes (I noticed 2 doors were closed) - but then she says half an hour, do I want her? Trying to be polite, I replied that as it is new place I really should meet all the ladies, and left.

May go back again to see who else is on. Took one of their cards, which gives two phone numbers, the one above and 0407 433981. Open 7 days, 8am to 8pm.

Also having initially rung, I did get an sms giving the address, and that came from number 0447 009345.

Looked around Chevron Island with no success, then went to Southport and saw Rose, the tiny Thai lady again.

@lightning...thanks for the info on the bundall place. Will have to check it out. You can't go wrong with Rose. She's not the prettiest but good firm massage and relief is good-o. Just had a wonderful session with Miranda and post a review soon.

My experience/comments : 
Had some business to attend to up in Brisvegas last Wed. so I found myself in the big smoke for the best part of the day. I got the nescessary out of the way in good time, as a result I found I had a couple of idle hours to fill...So, naturally my mind turned to some therapeutic pleasures. Not knowing the massage scene in the Bris. CBD, I wandered around for a bit sussing a few places out. The few I checked seemed a bit pricey($70.+ Hr) considering the reviews I had read indicated there was not much on offer.
I had passad "Mystyle" a little earlier,  as I hadn't seen any reviews (negative or otherwise) and I was starting to run out of time (I was traveling by train, and wanted to beat the peak hr) I ventured up to their establishment. I was informed the price for a full body oil massage would be $60. I agreed and was escorted to the room, told to undress and  await my masseuse. I did so, and climbed onto the table. After a minute or so A-lan entered,said hello and as she did placed a hand on my butt....Hummm..I thought things just might be looking up. She then started the massage. She didm't cover me with a towel at all, so I thought that was another positive indication.
Her massage was very good; med to light ,as I like it, very relaxing.The massage progressed on my back,neck and legs. when she got up to my thighs and buttocks things got interesting. She stayed in this area for a very long time and her technique changed from pure massage to a light tickling/tease. She was very good at this, I couldn't tell for sure if she was actually brushing my bits or not

....Any way the session continued along these lines until I was asked to turn over where my plight was on view for her to see. She continued the tease on the tops of my legs and inner thighs. I was actually squirming to try to get her to get a positive touch on my norty bits...To no avail I even at one stage held her hand and tried to guide it onto the area in the most need; this didn't work either She then said it was ok if I did the deed myself...Now this isn't my go at all, but, I thought if I did it might encourage her to become a little more involved, and maybe fondle my balls etc and help out. Alas it didn't....So I gave up and decided to get the problem seen to when I got back to the Coast. During all the goings on she was indicating there might be more on offer during any further visits. I don't know if this would be the case or if it is just an attempt to get me to return. In any case I quite enjoyed my time there so will probably try them(her) again when I'm next in Brisbane.

On my return to the Coast I headed to Nerang to try out No45 Station st. Unfortunately there was only the one girl working and she was busy; so I ended up down the hill (about 4 doors) at Ellys ___I have reviewed this place in the past.___Who should end up massaging me? ___None other than Candy, from Suzie Wongs at Ashmore. I have reviewed her before, and as her massage hasn't changed I won't do so again.

Just a thought ( I may be completely wrong), the ladies are usually trying to pronounce a Western name that's been given to them. Throw in accents and what not, I often have to ask a few times before getting it right. 

Having said that, are you sure she wasn't trying to say "Elaine" :-)

Hi Doc.
No, it's A-lan. I checked the spelling with her as I was unsure if I had heard it right..

caybee I have added the second section to the original Review and deleted your advice of the content. Also changed the name to A-lan which should sort out the pronunciation difference to Alan.

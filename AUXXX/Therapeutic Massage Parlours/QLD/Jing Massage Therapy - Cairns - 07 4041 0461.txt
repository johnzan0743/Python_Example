Size/shape : Size 10, tall, curvy, and quite attractive 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Taiwanese 

Services Provided : Massage 

Value for money/recommend? : Yes 

My experience/comments : Decided to check out this new place. Its a short 3-5min drive from the CBD and on a busy intersection. Entrance is not so discrete. Arrived and the girl on reception seemed friendly. I asked who would be doing the massage and she said that she would be. She was quite attractive so that was fine with me. Apparently two girls were available. Paid using a card and she took me to the room. Good set up with very clean and tidy separate walled rooms with doors. But no shower facilities. The girl made no mention of leaving underpants on so I stripped off, lay face down on the table and waited for her to return. She came back in and asked if I would like a towel over me. I said its fine without. So far so good... The massage commenced and the girl was chatty and friendly. Good English. Her massage skills were excellent. I did notice some certificates behind the wall at reception so I figure at least some of the girls here might have been properly trained and know what they are doing. As the massage progressed its became quite sensual with plenty of rubbing on my butt and inner thigh area. I didn't ask about extras and she never offered. I might drop a hint next time. But even without extras the massage was excellent and sensual. I would rate this as the best massage I've had in Cairns. On departing there was a very pretty Japanese girl on reception. Apparently she only works about two days a week. I booked her for my second visit and I'll be posting the review.

Person's Name : Rose

Establishment : Jing Massage Therapy Cairns 

Date of Visit : 21 August 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 203 Mulgrave Road (on intersection with Aumuller street). ph.40410461.

Hours of Business : 9am-6pm, 7 days

Rates : $70 for 60mins 

Age : 25

Size/shape : Size 6, B cups, nice legs, fair, long black hair

Nationality or Ethnicity : Hong Kong Chinese

Services Provided : Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Nice girl but prices on the high side

My experience/comments : Looks like at least some girls here will provide a HJ... Dropped in for a massage and Rose was available. Quite a pretty HK Chinese girl. Dressed in a short skirt that showed off her nice legs. Massage started well and in no time Rose was giving plenty of attention to my inner thighs and brushing my cock. I responded in an appreciative manner and Rose continual to provide plenty of sensual stimulation in the right places. I popped the question and asked if she would do a HJ. Rose said sure and that it would be $50. I offered $30 but she said no. Rose also offered a nude HJ for a further $50, which I declined. At that point I flipped over and Rose start to work my cock. Nice technique and she seemed to enjoy what she was doing. She took things slow and steady and worked me to a great climax and then cleaned me up with tissues and a wet cloth. I think $50 for a HJ is a bit steep but there is essentially no real competition in Cairns. An extra $50 for nude seems high. I'm sure Rose would have looked great nude but at $170 all up I think that's too much (ie $70+$50+$50). Even $70 for a basic 60min massage plus $50 for a straight HJ is on the high side. But that's the current Cairns market I guess. At the moment this is perhaps the only place in town where you can receive a HJ from a young Asian girl.

Also had a massage here with a pretty 25 year old Japanese girl (Yukko), but she won't do a HJ. Will be posting a review.

Person's Name : Yukko 

Establishment : Jing Massage Therapy Cairns 

Date of Visit : 16 August 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 203 Mulgrave Road (on intersection with Aumuller street). ph.40410461.

Hours of Business : 9am-6pm, 7 days

Rates : $70 for 60mins

Age : 25

Size/shape : Slim, taller, very nice legs (she looked great in her short shorts), quite pretty and attractive

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

Services Provided : Massage only

Value for money/recommend? : Not really but decent massage

My experience/comments : If you're after a very good firm massage Yukko is pretty good and definitely knows her stuff. But if you're after extras or at least a massage that's a little sensual this is not the girl for you. Booked Yukko and arrived at the appointed time. Paid my money and was shown to the room. Undressed and hopped on the table face down and waited for Yukko to arrive. Once back Yukko asked if I wanted the towel as to cover. I said it was fine without. I was nude so seemed a hopeful sign. She asked if there were any particular areas to concentrate on. I said my lower body. The massage commenced and felt pretty good. Very firm and relaxing but not the slightest hint of anything more on offer. Yukko kept well away from the sensitive areas. Once the flip came I decided to ask if she would massage my cock, thinking there was nothing to lose by asking. The response was "sorry, I don't" and a firm shake of the head. She didn't seem at all bothered by my question and continued to provide a good massage as we engaged in some casual chit-chat. All up a professional massage from a friendly girl. So far it looks like Rose and Elly are the only girls here who will do extra. Though I have noticed a couple of other Asian girls, who I'm yet to try. At least this shop seems to only hire young and pretty girls

Person's Name : Bunny

Establishment : Jing massage

Date of Visit : 2 August

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 203 Mulgrave Road (on intersection with Aumuller street). ph.40410461

Hours of Business : 9am-6pm, 7 days

Rates : $40 for 30mins

Age : 25-30

Size/shape : Size 10, nice legs, tan skin

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean

Services Provided : erotic massage

Value for money/recommend? : Decent tug for Cairns

My experience/comments : This place is very very low key about offering extras and you'll need to be discreet if you make a visit. Definitely don't ask about or hint at extras at reception or if you phone as you'll get a firm and direct no. Basically they don't want publicity or to be seen as a rnt shop. But that also means its the perfect cover for getting a rnt as it doesn't necessarily look like one. Not all girls will offer extras.  Rose was the best but has now departed (and who got much better in terms of extras offered and price from my earlier view above). The shop is a professional and very clean and tidy set up. 10/10 for cleanliness and presentation. At the least you'll get a great massage. Private specious rooms and all clean and tidy. Fresh towels on the table. Only downsides would perhaps be no showers and an entrance that's no so private if that's a concern. Its a very short drive or taxi ride from the cbd (around 5mins). Bunny is relatively new. I phoned up and made a 30 min booking and arrived at the appointed time. This was my first time with Bunny so I wasn't sure if she offered extras. She did a pretty decent massage and on the flip I hinted at extras and after some initial hesitation she said she would. But the price was $50 and she wouldn't budge so I declined (thinking if I politely held the line for $30 she would agree, but no joy). Though she did allow DIY. Anyway, she was young and attractive with a pretty face and temptation got the better of me. Booked a second session with Bunny and handed over the $50 for a 30min erotic massage. All up it was a nice slow and erotic tug. Plenty of ball and cock play before I blew my load towards the end of the session. This girl seemed to know what she was doing and enjoyed the process. Plenty of eye contact and chit chat as she played. Only limited touching allowed though. Perhaps she'll loosen up as I visit more. Very expensive considering that $50 will get you full nude and possibility more in Sydney. But hey this is Cairns and the options are very limited. So in the context of Bunny being young and cute and doing a decent tug the value was fine for Cairns.

I also made another visit and had another new girl, Gill (or Jill?). She's Taiwanese and I guess around 25-30. Attractive, warm and friendly and did a decent massage. But gave a definite no when it came to extras. But she did seem suspicious of who I might be so perhaps after a few more visits she might ease up and offer more.

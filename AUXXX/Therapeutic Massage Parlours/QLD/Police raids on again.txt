Ooft, and I was only just thinking about when my next punt would be there...do we know why they are raiding this time? or is it just the licensing issues?

1     Happened to be walking down Hicks street yesterday at 11.30 am and Police were at our popular shop. One cop on walkway greeted me with sort of a sheepish look as I walked past almost a little embarrassed at situation. I returned a comment and continued on my way to pick up my car and return to do some stalking. Approx 10 minutes later three cops including a female cop left the building all with huge smiles on there faces and in a light mood full of chatter. They gathered at there vehicle across road chatting for awhile then when 2 male overstayer prospects came along Hicks street they did the big ID check and were taking notes. 
Summary: didn't appear too serious about visit to angel.
2     Out socially last night and learned they also visited Abadi in Davenport st. New owners here and just interested in licencing and visas. No problems to report. By the way any one visited this shop recently. Things may have changed here re services.
Funny radio report as I right this!!!!!

bjelke Newman is in strife - see he would lose his seat if there were an election today - so desperate for distractions. A campaign against sex is an old favourite for those of his ilk.

“There is also no guarantee that the girls are even adults.”

Hmmm... yeah right, that's a real problem... more like there's no guarantee the ML will be under 45 (claiming to be 21 of course)!  I doubt very much we have a problem with under aged girls working in Gold Coast massage parlours.  If there's anything illegal going on (besides the obvious "special" massages) it's far more likely we have ladies claiming pension and pulling in a second income as well!

"Pulling in a second income" - they sure are, and they do a lot of pulling to get it.

My experience/comments : Went here twice over xmas as I was in the area and it was the only place I could find locally that was open and looked like it did extras. There was a Thai place down the road that looked far more interesting but it was shut for the week. 

The shop is in a converted house painted bright yellow, massage is upstairs. they say they do haircuts but I saw no evidence of that. There's a couple of bedrooms upstairs with tables in it, and a shower which is usefull. Both times the ladies looked at me strangely when I asked for a shower up-front. Which I thought was weird considering the climate of this place, I would have though they'd encourage it.

Anyway, extras were offered, either HJ or nude HJ. The extra's were cheap, I think $30 but I can't be sure.
It was weird, I got a total FS is on offer vibe, but all I got was "maybe" when asking. Maybe they want you to be a regular first.

Anway, I recall the massage was decent but not great, the HJ's were OK but nothing to write home about.

I know it's not a greatly detailed review but I figure an entry on here saying that extras are on offer is better than no review at all.

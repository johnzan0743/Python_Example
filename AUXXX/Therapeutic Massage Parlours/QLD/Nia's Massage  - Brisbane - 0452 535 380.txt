Dropped in to try this place on spec....there are not many massage shops that have great reviews in Brisbane.....Nia is very friendly and welcoming. Stripped off, face down on the table....what followed is the best deep tissue massage I have ever had....a few suggestive touches but mostly very hard work to give an excellent massage.

On the flip, the massage and various stretches continued....then came the classic gesture for extras and more money. She is a beautiful person so I won't detail them or what followed....but I can say she is THE BEST....take it easy and be generous and you will not be disappointed.

I will be back

 My experience/comments : 

I had seen Nia a month or so before but I never got around to writing up a review. As previously mentioned, Nia's message is pretty strong, going into remedial territory. I was at my tolerance level's upper limit and was pretty sore a couple of days afterward. She's a very acquired taste but I did like her extras and she is a friendly lady. I had planned to try the shop next door today but it was busy so I ended up a Nia's. The premises is fairly spacious with multiple rooms(which are cramp) but it seems that she's the only one working there. This time around, I told her that I found the last massage too strong and she proceeded to give me a more relaxing session. Nia's massage is split between dry and oiled with wipe down afterward. Her hands were still firm but not excruciating this time around and I quite enjoyed it that I was drifting to sleep. I wish there was more tickle tackle before turnover as she excels at teasing as well. This time around, I didn't have 50 for nude+daty but opted for 30 HE but she liked me enough offer partial nudity at least. No licky this time.. Now that I know that she can adjust her massage strength, I can certainly recommend Nia and will be back.

My experience/comments : So after my previous evening debacle (see Maymay private massage Brisbane) I decided I would go for a hard massage and finish myself off if I had to - I didn't have to 

I found Nia here on AUXXX... so thanks to the two previous reviewers. Fortunately I also googled her after reading about her here and found her on Facebook - search Nia's Massage Centre. She did ask how I found her and I went with "lucky search on Facebook" which she seemed happy with.

Nia gave me a sensationally hard massage through the shoulders, back, glutes and hamstrings! I love a hard to the point of being quite painful massage but this was almost too much. She can tone it down but I just let her do her job and felt better for it later. When she was doing my glutes she allowed her hands to slide right along my bum crack with a little extra downward pressure on my happy little bum hole and then down over my cock so I knew I wasn't going to have to worry about the end of this massage. The majority of the massage was done without oil and then she did about five minutes with oil which was nice. After cleaning my back and legs with a hot towel it was onto the front.

I had a flight to catch so we were both aware of the time and I really only had about ten minutes more to spend here so she asked what extras I would like. I opted for being able to touch her naked body and she gave me a nice happy ending with her hands. Had I had more time Nia probably would have spent some time massaging my front before the happy ending - she certainly isn't a clock watcher.

The happy ending was really very good partly because of the previous night's fail, partly because I do get off on a bit of pain but mostly because Nia is a beautiful person on the inside and it comes out as loving and caring. I really enjoyed my time with Nia and next time I am in Brisbane I will see her for a longer period without doubt.

Summary: Absolute Gem!

Out of curiosity I rocked up wanting to see what this old bird looked like. One word of advice... don't walk.. Run!! This lady looks like something from a 60's Chinese horror flick!!  She was just freaky with Very Heavy make up.  however I don't know what her service is like but I admit she seemed like a nice lady. I made an excuse and left as fast as possible!!

This isn't a case of your mileage may vary as the only mileage was under your runners - you are on a review site telling other punters that this is a definite no go and yet you didn't even sample the services on offer? Not very helpful to the provider or the punter and based on nothing really.

My experience/comments : Not a lot has changed since my review in December so I will just touch on the basics.

Nia does an exceptionally hard pressure point massage.

If you don't want hard then opt for her oil massage which is still quite firm but won't make your eyes water.

On the flip there are a number of options you can discuss with Nia - or discuss at the beginning so things flow.

Mainly this review is to put Nia out there again as, by her own admission, she is struggling for clients in a saturated market. After the massage, whilst we were chatting she asked if I would review her on Facebook and Google - I said that I would. I did not mention reviewing her here.

Anyone know where Nia's new base of operations are? I remember her telling me was moving in my last session. She gave me her new work address but I unfortunately lost the note.

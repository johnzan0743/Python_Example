Sup Guys, was walkin past the black coffee lyrics shop upstairs where that asian arcade is (wit noodle shops etc) and I saw a Thai massage place next to a Japanese Student visa agent place, walked in n noticed its curtain floor room styles but the girls i saw were really sexy.  Has anyone had a chance to scope this place out? Its a bit hard for me as my girlfriend goes to the VISA place a few times n they might recognise me lol

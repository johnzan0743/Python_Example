My experience/comments : 

After my experience at TTR. Burleigh I once again was in need of pressure release of the carnal variety, so I headed North up the highway toward Mermaid Beach to check on the Parlours in that area. As I was driving through Nobbys I saw a large yellow 'massage' sign on the South bound side of the road, so as soon as I could,I did a 'U' turn and headed back to check them out. I found a park off the highway, proceeded to and entered the shop. I was met inside the door by a young, very thin 20 something yo. Chinese? girl who showed me the pricing structure, she told me they had a $50. special on the 1hr massage, so I opted for that. She took me down a hallway, off which were about 7 or 8 rooms. The first one or two had walls which didn't quite reach the ceiling, the rest were fully enclosed and had solid, lockable doors. Although the one I was shown into had a frosted glass panel in the upper portion... I was told to strip off completely and lie face down on the table. I thought the girl who met me would be the one doing the massage, after a couple of minutes came a knock on the door and in came Emily; very small and cute. I thought....Ok...she said to me she just had to go to the bathroom and would be right back..She was a little hard to understand,but I figured she just didn't have a lot of English: no great problem...After what seemed to be 5 or more minutes she returned (I was beginning to wonder what was going on by this time). ..She started by throwing a towel over me (she had quite a few attempts at doing this)and started with the worst and poorest excuse for a massage I have experienced thus far in all my years of massage punting.Anyway 20 seconds of this and she climbed up onto the table between my legs.. She had only been there half a second when she slipped and nearly fell off. She kept mumbling...I'm ok...I'm ok....She then proceeded to lay on me like she was going to sleep. WTF.. I then turned around, took one look at her and asked...Are you on drugs??...To which she answered yes, but I'm ok..I'm ok, I can do it. I was not very happy at this turn of events so I told her to tell the girl at the front to shorten my session to half hour. Which she did and came back with $20. change from my $50. I decided to persevere with Emily to see how things paned out; in hindsight maybe I shouldn't have,as the session progressed along the same lines as the beginning, pushing,pulling and having brief naps along my back. With about 10mins to go she asked me if I wanted .I declined, Not that I didn't need one, but I wasn't keen on letting a drugged up space cadet get any thing like a death grip on my punting equipment......She must have needed the extra dollars (probably to pay for her latest hit. Which she probably had in the toilet while I was waiting for her) as she kept asking and at times rubbing my old fella.(this did get me hard) But as I said I wasn't going there. I had already decided to head out to Nerang and try my luck at 45 Station St again.
I haven't seen any reports at all on this establishment, so I don't know if anyone else has had similar experiences here.
Having said all the above I am in no way canning the shop, their service or the other girls. It's just on this occasion I happened to get a very 'high' Emily, which resulted in an experience that left(for me)a lot to be desired.
I would have to think long and hard before I would contemplate a return. And.......Just to round out a disastrous day...When I got to 45 Station St..Once again they were all busy(2nd time for me).I didn't have time to waste hanging around, so I guess I'll just have to wait till tomorrow to get my itch scratched.............
Funny, I don't remember breaking any mirrors lately.

You definitely drew the short straw there. You should have complained to the receptionist and asked for your money back.

The thought did cross my mind. But the three girls that were there were all in a similar age group(late teens, very early 20's). I didn't want to cause a scene, as you just don't know which way someone effected by drugs will jump. I don't think there was a mamasan /boss on the premises to sort things out; otherwise there probably would have been no drug taking taking place. Also there was another punter in one of the rooms who had arrived 15mins after me...At the end of the day it was only 30 bucks, a loss but not a huge one....But, still and all, you're probably right.

Thank you for your review Caybee.

Good review.

It's hard to underestimate the value of posting reviews,especially of disappointing results.

Most often it's cases like this, Saved me $500, where you or another member are alerted to a dud with attractive ads that they were just on the point of visiting.

But the act of recording the unsatisfactory event also makes it clearer to you what were the tell tale signs that you noticed right from the start and were confirmed as it went on.

This ultimately helps my 'starfish detector' become more sensitive to words, situations and lying ads. It also probably helps confirm
what works for me and what doesn't.

My experience/comments : I saw the crazy review above and thought that I needed to experience this craziness for myself. Dropped $30 to the lady at the counter and was taken in to a very small room with a lockable door, was told to hop on the table and she exited, followed closely by an entrance of Cathy asking what type of massage I was after, I said medium hard, and she hopped up and straddled me and got to work on my back, arse and legs for a good 15 minutes. She was dressed in a modest top, and a short skirt and on the turn asked the Question and made the $20 gesture, which was a resounding yes!

She moved a long way down the table and wasn't keen on any access, but she did look good.  Her hand technique was good and within a few minutes I was a little lighter, and missed out on anything interesting report unlike Caybee above.  Cheap and cheerful, a thumbs up from me.

Hi, gcmale.
I am happy to hear about your punt, which seemed to be most satisfactory and to your liking. It just goes to show; no two punts are exactly alike.
As I said in my review, I was in no way tipping a bucket on the shop, the girls or the service provided overall. Unfortunately, on my visit I was unlucky to have Emily as my masseuse, who, by her own admission, was high on some substance.(not pot.)I would have been able to smell it if that was the case.
Anyway, at the end of the day I have only myself to blame for persevering with the session and not demanding another ML.
I'm glad that your review shed a more positive light on 'Miki's' as I didn't think my experience was the norm for this shop. If I'm ever in the area again(happens rarely) and in need, I could be tempted to revisit.
Once again. Thanks for your post.

So true caybee that is why everyone should make honest reviews of their own experiences as they can vary immensly based on many different factors.

My experience/comments 
Hit this place after work. Put me off a bit with the sign on the door offering health fund rebates. Walked in and paid and shown to the room, asked if I'd been there before... yes! haha. nuded up and got on the table. A pretty little thing started the massage and there was nothing really going on. The massage was pretty good actually. About half way through another girl swapped over. She pulled no punched squeezing between my hands up the top pf the table letting me feel those smooth legs and tight ass, this got the juices flowing. On the turn over things quickly went from there. $20 the tug, $50 topless, $100 BJ. Didn;t have the hungy!! Spewin! so went the topless. Access all areas except internal. Great little bod with B titties. Had me blowing in no time. Even a kiss at the end. She spoke good english so I'm thinking uni student.

My experience/comments 
Called past here again. Was greeted by an older bird dressed to the 9's. she was sort of attractive. Got to the room and got ready. She come back and started the massage. Some small talk and it wasn't long before some tackle tickle. She laughed and giggled as my hands slipped up her skirt. Not much of an ass to speak of. In the roll over things quickly progressed. She kissed my cock and then asked if I wanted a hand job. I motioned blow job and she held up 10 fingers. So a $100. It was agreed. She took her clothes off and got into it. She didn't take much of it in as she was bobbing up and down. So the old hand in the back of the head to get a bit deeper was in order. She slipped her finger up my ass which I've never had before and fuck me I had an absolute raging hard on. Trying to keep my cool as I was ready to blow hoping she take the load, she popped up and smiled as she milked me by hand to completion. Was a good experience, I'd probably not go for the blow job again unless the girl was a bit prettier.

My Experience/comments: The shop has rooms with doors (but not proper rooms) with 1 shower in the entire shop. Very Clean.

I got a Japanese girl forgot her name. Her massage was fantastic. Nice and strong. If you want a strong massage let the reception know when you book. Her massage was so good I never asked for the extra.

But I was told they do provide it if you ask in the room.

This is not a private massage joint its a shop

Went there unfortunately they lock the door so it was a long uncomfortable wait before I was let in 
clean shop nice colour scheme walls don't go up to the ceiling so can her conversations easily like the traveller trying to date the jap chick in the next room
had yessi  Korean 30 year old who did a good professional massage  (a little to hard for me ) and was wearing a hot cock tail dress so I figured more was on offer
and yes a hand job $30 topless $50 with playing with her tits ok 
get the feeling this is a legit massage shop moving into the realms of extras

Overall a good deal

I've had massage with yessi before.

If you are after super hard massage proper massage shes really good. Her stylish is thai based but mixed with everything else. 
If your after thai massage shes good for this unless you intend to fly to thailand or go proper thai massage shop.

I have requested a move to Theraputic Massage Parlours WA.

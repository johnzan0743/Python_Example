Value for money/recommend? : 5/10

My experience/comments : Looks : petit girl with a really tight body . 7/10
Massage: on the professional side it was really good, very relaxing. On  the erotic side it was , sorry to say, sub-par. Very little massaging  the ass, and nothing between the legs. I ain't even hard when she told  me to roll over. 
Extra: HJ, clothes off, BJ. I took the HJ for $50 cause I liked the girl  . Good technique but once again only focused on my cock, no play with  the rest of the body at at all. Se also stopped me to say times up.  Apparently there was a bit of confusion between the receptionist and the  girl cause I asked for 1 hour and she thought it was only half.  Needless to say, it was a mood killer and I just ended the massage  there. 4/10

My experience/comments :
Decided to give this place another go as i believe in 2nd chances. Went in and I was lead into a very large room (walls to the ceiling which was  nice) and paid the $70 for the massage.  A nice looking, young Asian  woman came in for the massage (Nancy.)  Personally, I much prefer a  massage that has good, hard pressure rather than a more sensual massage.   And holy crap, Nancy's massage for me was absolute perfection - great  amount of pressure and what I really enjoyed was if she felt a knot, she  would work that area rather than just continue with the rest of the  massage.  There was a bit of teasing when I was on my front.  Asked to  roll over and there wasn't much massaging going on but there was plenty  of teasing.  I put my hand out as if to touch her but she pushed my hand  away almost immediately - didn't really like the vibe there.  That  being said, the massage was a 10/10.  
 Extras - HR for $30, topless for $50, naked for $80.  I was just  going to go for topless but decided to have her naked (why the hell not,  right?)  Very nice and tight body, great ass, small boobs, very hairy  (for those interested.)  


 Because of what happened earlier, I was keeping my hands to myself.   However as I'd paid, that must have been her signal for all systems go  as she grabbed my hand and put it on her ass. That was awesome!   Continued with HR as I was mostly rubbing her back and grabbing her ass  - she must have seen me looking at her boobs as she then took my hand  and put it on her boob.  



 HR was nice and slow and GREAT - made me finish a lot quicker than  normal.  I could have sworn that would be the end of the massage and the  45 minutes but she was more than happy to continue the massage and rub  my legs.


 Very, very happy with the establishment and the experience this time and will definitely be going back

Mate.  You are paying way too much for extras.  Try going in with only a small amount of money in your wallet.  Eg $40 and say that's all you have (keep and extra $20 in your pockets).  When they give their prices say you only $30 and bargain from there.   Works 95% of the time for me.

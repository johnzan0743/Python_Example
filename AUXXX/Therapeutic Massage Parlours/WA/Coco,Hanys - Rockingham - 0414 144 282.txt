[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments :

2nd punt at Hanys is as many weeks. Had 4 girls available, all similar height weight and age, picked Coco from the line because she looked like she had nicer boobs than the rest.

off to the room, strip off then back out to the shower which is in the hallway.

I always start off by warming the girl up, I tend not to do DATY at low end Asian places so just let my fingers do the walking all the while exchanging kisses and licking her beautiful c cup boobs, within a minute or two I could see and feel the effects with her breathing increasing, the hips started bucking and she moistened up nicely. 

Next was my turn she started the blowjob bareback but slipped a com on midway through which bought me down from the edge, it had been pretty good up to that point.

Next was the sex and this was pretty average, started in missionary unfortunately her groans sounded like she was getting hurt so we switched to doggy her sounds did not change kept going until I came. 

After a a bit of a massage we went into round 2, she started with a CBJ then she jumped on in cowboy but again she was sounding more like I was hurting her, tried a few different positions however her sounds put me off and could not finish.

Overall this was my first average punt at Hanys.

My experience/comments :

Saturday arvo punt to escape the heat, they Had 4 girls available, picked Nancy from the line, she had a sensational looking body and was smiling

off to the room, strip off then back out to the shower which is in the hallway, shower had shocking water hammer.

Started with a little kissing and fondling on the bed, her tits were real and the nipples hardened when I gave them a lick.

I moved down to DATY she loved the DATY and I love it as you feel them start bucking those hips of push your head back down if you come up for air.

After I got her to orgasm we swapped and we went into a fairly routine CBJ, asked about BBBJ but was told no - against the rules

Sex was good but the massage in between rounds was sensational, she really knew how to give a good massage.

I let the massage go on too long so round 2 felt like a rush but I got there in good time 

Overall this was a great punt, probably one of the best I have had in Aus

You only appear to have posted one review that I can find of this place way back in February 2013. I have obviously missed some so could you please post the links to all your others of this place Prawnstar?

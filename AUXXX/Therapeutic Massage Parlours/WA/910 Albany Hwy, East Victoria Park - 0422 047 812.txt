When she asked for 50 I said I only had 30 sorry and it was okay. There are 2 girls one old and one young. Always ask if there are other girls available when the old one is handling the main desk

yeah i went a few weeks ago. I came in and it seem like only one person was there working. I asked how much for a massage and if there are any extras and unfortunately she said no. Which was a real bummer. So i bailed. I was thinking maybe not all the girls provide it.

Poor MP... they leave their chinese serials playing on the TV quite loud and the music is sort of just a light whisper in the background.  The massage itself was alright depending on who you get... if you get the heffer who is there everyday... I don't think she offers anything... but the other girls who rotate in and out typically will offer extras.  Hit and miss... I'd give it a miss... been there thrice... not anymore.

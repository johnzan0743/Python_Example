My experience/comments : Got a backlog of posts to make so may as well start here.
Was on a working holiday to the West Coast so thought I would explore a little. It is on a quiet-ish street.
Nhi answered the door in heels and invited me in. Timber floor-boards so her steps echoed like no tomorrow. Led to the room and she asked the standard how long and extras. 
Tried negotiating but she stood firm with her pricing, $80 for topless HJ!!!, $50 HJ. 
Was outrageously horny so thought fine. Also there were no reviews and thought someone had to get one in to say yay or nay. Oh what a mistake.
The ad stated young girls, however she was the only one on. Massage table was a portable jobbie that rocked during the massage. No music either which means you hear her every step on the floorboards, any traffic passing, people on the street etc.
Standard massage, nothing special, then flipped over. She raised her top but didn't take it off, played with her small tits and finally got off. It was exceptionally mechanical.

Would not recommend... there is another place in perth in osborne park here for the same price you get alot better value for the same price.

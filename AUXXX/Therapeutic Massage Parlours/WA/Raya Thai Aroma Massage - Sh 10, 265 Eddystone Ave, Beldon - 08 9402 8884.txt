My experience/comments : Came here for a massage without expecting anything, and was half way through a nice rub down when offerered "extra" thought that would be nice and agreed but had to bargain for the price of the xtra. Susi (? still not so sure of the ladies name) did and excellent job and I was very delighted with the result. Overall was an enjoyable time but was it worth $100? Call me old fashioned but I don't think so...Stiil felt good, its just the value for money that is a worry..

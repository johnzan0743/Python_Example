Centrally located, opposite to Duxton Hotel.  Anyone had experience of any extras?  I have been twice and had 2 very professional therapeutic massages by two different attractive mid-20's Asian masseuse but no extras offered.  Anyone with any other experiences?

Hi Tonster,
The only thing that you'll get from this massage place is a very, very, good massage. Clean joint with excellent massage. That's it.

Yeah, not very "Thai" though is it?  Even the music sounds Chinese.  

They have nice colour brochures listing 10 different treatments - it's pretty much exactly the same spiel as the brochures at VIP and Lily's and goodness knows how many others (special offer at the printers?).  But when you ask, as at those other places, chances are you won't be able to choose.  They didn't even offer "Thai"...

Anyhow I went in for a massage today - wasn't looking for extras and they weren't offered.  I saw Susie - she was tired, but she put in a great effort.  

I've had a lot of disappointing massages and I've become a bit fussy, but this was a good massage so this place is going on my list.  

Incidentally - it's at #22, more like opposite the Concert Hall than the Duxton.

Sorry all, my bad... I think that I have these MP's mixed up.  The one that is being referred to in this thread is NOT a "Thai MP"... rather it is same owner as the one just north in East Perth.  The thai one... is somewhere else in the city... might be along Barrack... and if you want a relaxing, strong massage, then that's the place to get it... 100% clean though.

Thanks nverg for setting the record straight.  There is a Chinese girl there who is quite pretty.  The 2nd time I went, I was naked with the Korean girl but still no mention of extras.

NB the place at 22 St Georges Tce says "Thai Traditional Massage", and the name on the credit card slip sounds Thai, but that's about the extent of Thai influence I saw there.

I went again tonight.  The place is ruined by the Chinese ladies from VIP health massage from East Perth.  I had a young Chinese girl who was very polite but she declined any extra services which are only available from the older masseuse.

I went here few weeks ago. Lady in charge was tall Korean girl covering reception as well. I asked her about extras but was said "not provided". Massage was pretty avarrage (at least nothing to remember in few weeks). She got another booking from regular in a middle of session so the rest was "hurry up". Meanwhile 10 minutes to the final ring she ask me "would you like special"??? Price - $50 RnT and $100 to see her boobs... Negotiating took 5 minutes so I decided 100 hard earn bucks it's too much for 5 minutes to see her A boobs and (may be) touch her pussy. The show was over and I 've been  asked to dress up and go. 
Come back? Are you kidding. 
The only pros was - it's in a city (corner of Barrack) so as a CBD dweller I could combine long walk with relax and enjoy. Which doesn't happened anyway.

Person's Name : Amy

Establishment : Shen's Massage

Date of Visit : Sep 12

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 22 St George Terrace. Open place open til 10pm. Blacked out windows

Hours of Business : 10am-10pm

Rates : 60mins / $60

Age : 25..ish

Size/shape : 6 ... B cups...Hot body!!!

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Not for just RnT

My experience/comments : 
After long days' work, I was just wanting a normal massage to fix my shoulders and back. This was the only place open late and near the hotel. Blacked out windows always a sign that something else could be on offer.
Waiting downstairs when I see another girl walking a punter out and this place has got some cute talent working. I was hoping I got this girl in the tiny shorts and not some old mamasan.

2 mins later the same girl comes down to get me. Upstairs, get a view of the other girls who all look quite cute, so someone is doing a good job in HR recruiting, lol.

The rooms are curtained off with paper thin walls, so not sure at this stage how much extra could go on but wait for the girl to come back into room. Massage is actually not bad.  Good pressure and right technique to fix my knots and sore muscles. Towel stays on the whole time, so I'm thinkign at this stage nothing else on offer, which was fine. No brushing of anything but not staying well clear like the usual legit places.
Plenty of chat, banter, laughs and time for the flip. Hands move around a bit more freely and then she leans over and whispers those famous words "would you like extra massage" pointing . "Sure" I say, "how much" $50 was the reply. Shit it's just not the hotels which are expensive in Perth. I couldn't talk her into clothes coming off and only allowed touching of her bum (which at least was one of the best I've seen on an asian chick).
On goes the oil, one hand, two handed. She is using every technique been taught to her. At least they put some effort in.
She rubs the genie lamp too many times and gets to make a wish. Comes back with some towels to wipe clean up and wipe off oil.

Hmmm would I return: Not yet. Have some other places to try first thanks to some contacts but would be interesting to see if repeat business open up some more extras.
Like so

 Thai Massage Perth
				
Post Content: 
name: Maggie

establishment: thai massage, 22 St Georges Tce Perth

visit: 12pm, 3 Jan 2012

opening hours: open at 9am - not sure about closing

rates: $35 for 30min massage, $50 for happy ending

age early 20s

size: slim, nice perky tits

nationality: chinese

services: massage with handjob

recommendation: I will definitely be going again!

To be honest I was a bit nervous as this was my first time going looking for a "happy ending", but Maggie at thai massage did not disappoint! I didnt make an appointment and just popped down on my lunch break, a young girl on the counter asked me how long I wanted (she must just assume I want a full body massage) and then said it would be a 5 min wait.

As soon as Maggie came out I thought I might be in luck - she was a hot young chinese girl in a skimpy singlet top and tiny hotpants shorts. Maggie was pretty shy and very giggly (which I found cute) and she took me to a room and told me the drill about undressing etc.

The massage was very nice, and she focussed mainly on my buttocks and upper thigh which got me pretty hard! She also kept brushing her hands against my cock at every opportunity so I started to think there was a fair chance of my first happy ending. After around 20 mins she pointed to my cock and asked if I wanted it massaged - hell yes!

She made some sort of signal which I didnt understand but then we finally sorted out that it would cost an extra $50 which was fine - money paid and away we go. Her handjob was amazing - she used both hands and lots of lube so it was quite different to home if you get my drift  She was happy enough to let my lightly grope her ass, legs and round the front of her shorts while she wanked me off, but she did pull away when I moved my hand up to her tits. I apologised and she giggled, moved my hand back to her ass and then went back to work. She was pretty hot so between the nice view of her tits jiggling up and down and the feel of her ass I came all over the joint, but she cleaned it all up very carefully and then gave me a hot towel all over.

When it was over she thanked me for coming, and got me a cold water while I got my clothes on. All in all it was a great lunchbreak (hard to go back to work though) very nice and relaxing. I'm not sure how the prices compare to other places but I thought it was much better value than the extras on offer at the strip joints I had been to.

I can't wait to go back so I can do review number two - hopefully I get a different girl so I can see whether the service differs!

Anyone know what time they close on a Sat night? I rang the number with no answer, so I suspect they're already closed.

Can you offer any alternative RNT in the city, prefer eastern end, that is open late on a Sat night?

Thanks.

name: Maggie

establishment: 22 St Georges Tce Perth - the only dodgy looking massage place in the building ;-)

visit: 9 Jan 2012

opening hours: 9am-11pm

rates: $65-60mins massage. $50 on top for rnt (not the cheapest, but she's a cutie)

Age : 20-something

size: 6 i'd say... skinny :-)

nationality: PRC

services: full body massage with optional RNT at the end.

recommendation: She is a real cutie. Very skinny and a nice tight, short dress. The massage was a normal therapeutic massage from start until just about the end. She uses good technique and pressure. At the end after the flip, she 'gets slack' covering you up with the towel. Its kinda hot actually, as i watched her massage my legs, she was copping an eyeful of mini me and smiled. 

At the end, she asks very quietly if it ok to massage (points to my rock hard fella) and then says $50. I get the feeling its not really negotiable. I asked to remove her dress/cop a feel of her boobs etc, but she said it was ok to feel her butt as she jerked me off. her technique was amazing. She slowly builds the tension, not like a race, and then at the end she manages some sort of hand gymnastics and catches the whole load in her hands (an art i am yet to master). 

She then does a little clean up followed by a hot towel rub down.

I left feeling like i'd been to heaven.

Hey afterarnt, glad to see you enjoyed Maggie as well! It was my first time with her, although I'm hoping that she might offer a little more on a return visit, at least taking the top off or something like that.

I've heard that some girls will progressively offer more on return visits - has anyone had any luck with that at this place?

Hi, been here 3 times and have noticed if you ask for the "Thai" massage they will always offer HJ at the end. Went my second time I ask for a normal pressure massage and at the end no HJ was offered, still a very good massage tho.

Person's Name : I can't even say it let alone spell it (German) Sorry!

Establishment : Thai Massage 

Date of Visit : Apr13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 22 St Georges Terrace Perth CBD

Hours of Business :
10-8

Rates : 60mins / $70 + $50 HJ

Age : 30ish

Size/shape : 12-14, natural D cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : German

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Yep

My experience/comments :

Walked in and was welcomed buy a cute German girl.

After the usual intro she asked how long... I said an hour and she escorted me to a room upstairs and told me to get undressed. I followed with the usual do you want my underwear on or off and I got the cheeky smile saying she doesn't mind and it was up to me. Taking that as a YES, she left the room and I proceeded to set myself up on the table.

She came back and asked about pressure to which I responded Medium and the massage was great. She also asked about focus areas which I advised her of and it was perfect.

Throughout there was no hint of extras but thought I would ask anyway. She mentioned she does not usually do this but only for me and it was $50. I accepted because I was randy as hell and she proceeded to perform an beautiful HJ with her allow me to play with her tits and pussy through her clothes.

I could feel her getting wet through her underwear and her slight moaning was enough to get me over the line. She continued to pump ever so slowly to keep me hard and told me to not stop rubbing her as she was close also and she came straight afterwards with shuddering and squeak like moans so no one could here.

With a clean up and a nice pash (very unexpected) I walked out a happy man vowing to return very soon.

Dropped by today and the German girl is indeed long gone, as you said for quite a while too. I did get a passable massage from a young Asian girl but didn't bother asking for extras. Was a little disappointed to miss a German girl spotting a D cup, lol.

Went to this place yesterday.
Paid $65 / hr massage to the receptionist, just when other quite cute Asian girl came out.
Went in the room, expecting cutie to appear, but to my slight disappointment, 'receptionist' came in and started massage.
She was not ugly, but nothing special 4-5/10, not quite my type, but did quite good massage. 
I asked for extras early on, but my girl does not do it, but other girk will for $50.
I accepted hoping for cutie to appear, however ti my bigger disappointment  a middle aged lady, that I haven't seen earlier,  came in.
HJ was bad, only minimal touching was sort of tolerated, full clothing.
Will not be going back.

Two ladyboys alternate between this shop and another shop (don't know where exactly)... if you want the ladyboys... go later in the night.. after 9pm... I believe that they are rostered on during the later hours as the boss seems to think that somehow they would have less clientele so pushes them to work the graveyard shift.

I am definitely not a ladyboy fan but I think I might have had a BBBJ CIM from one when I visited recently. Was rather suspicious when I saw 'her' from the start but she was very pretty. Name of Emily. Gave me a decent massage for 10 minutes or so and then on turnover asker for $50 for clothed HJ. Outrageous rip off but I thought this might be Perth prices. My suspicions were further raised when she refused to let me go near her breasts even over her clothes.it was obvious nothing was going to happen without touching and the next thing I know she blows on little MB and whispers in my ear about a BJ. I offered $70 and she countered with $80 which I accepted. I assumed it would with  be a condom so was surprised when she got straight into it without. Even more surprised when she happily accepted the load I dumped in her mouth. She had been pretty distant but loosened up towards the end and as I left she gave with a card with her mobile on and asked me to book her directly next time and gave me a cuddle and a light kiss. Happy to pass on her number via PM but not in the public forum. All in all a strange experience but I can't say it was not pleasant but I doubt I will be seeking out other ladyboys. An unexpected box ticked I guess but definitely not my usual scene.

 Lack of knowledge about the NOR regions.

Hi 

I have decided I'm getting abit old to be galavanting around looking for women to screw, I know i can hear you all screaming at me now. 

It has become apparent having been in Australia for 4 months there is a distinct lack of information about any services up here in the northern suburbs. There simply must be parlours/day spas which the girls offer abit of RnT they all seem to be situated around the city which is good but abit of a mare if I fancy a bit of relief after work. Having spent the day yesterday looking on line there are hundreds of places up here but no reviews i know most of them are going to be legit but the odd one must be good. To that end I'm going to find one I will of course post reviews as and when i have visited and keep people in the north upto date you never know there may well be a little gold mine up here.........

If anybody knows of the odd place post here and I can go check it out.

look forward to my first review hopefully it will be a positive one after i have visited my first establishment this afternoon.

Kieronlines,
They tend to come and go quite regularly up this way. You could try the Amanda Massage at Clarkson, Greenwood Oriental Massage near the Greenwood hotel, Selvia in Hillarys is reviewed in here, and I saw an ad for a new massage place in Yanchep the other day which is in the light industrial area up there, so may be worth a try. 
There is a legit Thai massage place in Clarkson that has started advertising External Prostate Massages...As soon as I get time I will try that out and post a review.
Keep us all up to date on your adventures ya?

Enjoy the search...

Recommend............yes going to go back again.

I feel really bad i didn't ask the girls name or engage in small talk but once the massage began i honestly felt like nodding off it was so relaxing.

I decided to try this place on the way home as i thought there had to be a few little gems hidden around. I rang before to make sure they were open and had somebody availiable the girl on the phone was very pleasant. When I pulled up out side I thought it was going to go bad it looked to legit but i was there if anything I get a good massage out of it. I entered the premesis and was greated by a 4 foot something young Thai in skimpy shorts and top . I paid 40 as i thought 1/2 hour is enough to see what happens. She leads me to the room and shows me in elling me i can hang my clothes on the pegs at the end. Heres where I show my stupidity....... I strip to my boxers I have no idea what i am doing do i go full naked and offend or do i look like a tit. In comes my Massuse not the same girl  but nice enough  she looks at me and tells me to remove my pants.... onto the table i get the towel which i assumed was to cover my arse is discarded on the floor and she starts the massage.

I am a little tense as i am slightly nervous i don't know why but i am so she slaps my ass check telling me to relax relax...... so i do just go with the flow. what a rub greaqt massage nice and firm with cheeky glances of my sack as she is doing my legs. Like i said I am drifting away with how relaxed she is making me feel if she doesn't do extra i don't care....... so we come to the flip i think well the towel will come in handy here as i am now standing to attention. Nope no towel massage continues with glances to my ever hardening cock. she leans over and asks do i want hand job and topless..... $50 for hand job $100 for top off shit thats pricey i say no thanks i don't have $50 in my wallet i didn't realise this was on offer it's my first time.... she giggled not quite knowing what to do i barter for $40 cause im an idiot and only have $20's in my wallet should have offered $20 but i went $40 and hell it was worth it she did things i have never felt before. She allowed touching and was willing to let me in her short to her pussy.

I will return as it looks good and i rekon you could get different extras with different girls and i want to try the little one at the front.

Not sure where i will try next.

kieronlines can you concentrate on getting and remembering the name of the provider. As you have realised, without this detail a review in meaningless.

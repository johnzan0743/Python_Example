Person's Name : Kelly

Establishment : Paradise Massage

Date of Visit : 2/1/14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 3/1 Irwin Rd Wangara, 0431 318 142...6406 1294

Hours of Business : 9:30 - 9

Rates : The usual : half hour $40, 1 hour $70 (HJ $30)

Age : 20's

Size/shape : Curvy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Yep, worth the time.

My experience/comments : This is a new AMP that has opened in Wangara in the Northern Suburbs of Perth, very close to the Wanneroo Markets. It is nice and fresh inside, and the girls are quite cute and very friendly. They have only been open a couple of weeks and tell me that its been very quiet up until now.
After working hard in the backyard every waking minute for the last couple of weeks, my body was screaming out for a massage, so I dropped in earlyish in the morning to try to soothe the muscles. I tried ringing a few times with no answer, so I just dropped in on the off chance that I could get in. A pleasant welcome was given and Kelly took me to the room, which was very clean and fresh with a new massage table.
There wasn't anywhere to hang my clothes so I just placed them on the stool and the massage begun.
Kelly gave a very soothing and relaxing massage until she began the top of my legs and buttocks, at that stage I would have to say the soothing dropped away and the stimulating began. She was so very very good at what she was doing.
Kelly uses some interesting body positions to ensure that she works on all of the muscles that need manipulating and overall it was a rather enjoyable time.
Will definitely be back for more.

Highly recommended.

Thank you for your good review brudr12.

An excellent way of putting it, "uses some interesting body positions to ensure that she works on all of the muscles that need manipulating ..".

Person's Name : Christine

Establishment : Paradise Massage Wangara

Date of Visit : 29th Jan 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : as per above

Hours of Business : as above

Rates : $70 massage per hour, ++ as negotiated

Age : 30's

Size/shape : very sexy, trim, taut and smooth

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chnese

Services Provided : RnT, BBBj, DATY, Body to body

Value for money/recommend? : Definitely!!

My experience/comments : Had a return visit, but Kelly was not working so I was lucky enough to have Christine to do my massage. Christine told me that he shop had become very busy since opening, and after having a massage with her I can understand why! Absolutely sensational massage with almost everything included (no FS) for a discounted extra charge "since it was my first massage with her". Fifty bucks for all those extras was wonderful value, especially when I compare it to some of the times I have been ripped off in the past.
My recommendation only gets higher and higher for this great new place.

Nice looking place, good private rooms
$50 for 30 mins, $85 hour
HJ $30 extra
Nude $20 extra
Anna at reception, blond dyed hair, looks caucasian but must be asian.
was in hurry so went with her, even though average and no curves.
Friendly enough but the best of the day was the cool glass of water.
Wouldn't go back for the rest if it was free

My experience/comments:

I decided to pay this place a visit because it's very close to my house...I guess my curiosity got the better of me. When I came in through the front door, the VERY young thai lady behind the front desk didn't look too happy as I approached. The way she looked at me and treated me with suspicion...it just seemed as though she'd had bad experiences with men before. Anyway, after I pay up, she takes me into a room and tells me to take off my clothes and lay down (there was a towel set up on the ground for me to lay on), and then exited the room. She came back into the room a few minutes later wearing only knickers and a brah. She massaged my back, neck, arms, shoulders and legs. The massage itself was quite pleasant because it was smooth and soft -- not like a chinese massage where they have a tendency to dig their elbows and forearms into your back and cause pain. After the massage, she tells me to turn over, looks at my cock to see if it's hard (which it was) and asks me if I want extra service. She then runs through the prices for the extra services on offer. I can't remember the exact prices, but she wanted extra money to take her bra off, and more cash on top of that for a handjob. I agreed to all of it. The handjob was crap and I didn't even get off. I think this girl was just too young and inexperienced because she didn't seem to know how to stimulate the head of my penis properly. The way she stroked my cock was just way too gentle and lacking in vigour. I told her I couldn't cum because I was just tired. The only good thing about it was that she had a good body and let me feel her tits while she was jerking me off.    

In a nutshell: the girl I dealt with was definately good looking and had a good body but didn't seem too happy or enthusiastic, and gave an ordinary handjob (I didn't even cum). The customer service was crap because they weren't very friendly and treated me with suspicion from the word go. Oh, and their prices are a rip-off!

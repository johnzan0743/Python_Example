My experience/comments:

Hi all here is my first review on this site. Been here a couple of times and seen the same girl. This place is near the TAFE and Claisebrook Train St so quite discrete. No need to ring for appt, I never have and only had to wait briefly once. Very pleasant establishment. Unrushed service. They give HJ only but i like a nice firm massage they give so happy with everything. Backy is a student cos I've seen her study there. She charges $30 for HJ but i offer $20 and she OK with this. Her HJ is slow and builds up but not very sensual. She uses microwave wet towel before and after massage and HR and very good at removing oil which i find great.

Triester... no, not the same Maggie from Bodywell.  Don't think Maggie from Bodywell is still in the biz... or at least, I've not seen her in other MP's.... recently.  Then again, she only worked 2~3 days a week when she was at Bodywell.

Dick's reference to Maggie is spot on... she's got a cute bum IMO...

Person's Name : Helen

Establishment : VIP Health Massage

Date of Visit : Feb 2012

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 25/38 Fielder St East Perth  92219887

Hours of Business :  9am-9pm 7 days

Rates : Massage $65/hr  Extras $30+

Age : 28

Size/shape : short not too skinny

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, HR 

Value for money/recommend? : yes and no

My experience/comments : VIP is a clean and pleasant enough place, but the cubicles are small, walls thin, and they don't go to the ceiling, so it didn't feel very private at first.  Went ahead anyway, and the extras were delivered very discreetly and very well I must say, with some nice teasing beforehand and a nice slow build-up, and scarcely a sound, even the negotiations were silent...  Sadly I didn't enjoy the massage much, it started with that Chinese style (I wasn't given a choice) which consists mostly of shoving, followed by oil massage which was slightly better but much too jagged and fast for my liking.  The extras were rather good, but next time I would opt for a shorter massage.

Been there twice... only looker is a very young Chinese called Kathy (or Ka Ka). Unfortunately she does not do extras and her massage is terrible. I asked her if the others do extras and she pointed out two ladies who are way past their use by date. Hell... one of them was even talking to the other about her son who is 23 this year....

Date of Visit : 1/11/12

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 25/38 Fielder St, East Perth - 08 9221 9887

Hours of Business : 10am Â– 9pm 7 days

Rates : $65/hr

Age : Mid thirties

Size/Shape : C Cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : RnT with promise

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : I like this place as it is a short (two station) train ride from town and it has an no frills, no pretense feel. Skanky, in a good way.
Helen is very good at the massage with a hint of something extra to follow. She was wearing tight shorts showing as much leg as possible. Once I had broken the ice by giving those legs some stroking she started the tackle tickle. She had the little fella not so little just before half time oranges.

On the turn she set the price ($50, everything is expensive in Perth) and I tried to get her top discarded in the deal. No go, but she allowed bra undone, lifted, and mams exposed. Good set for the PRC.
She really enjoyed the work and I made her work hard, stopping her a couple of times. It was an enjoyable time for both of us with her trying to get me over the line and me trying not to. I was too busy seeing how far my hands could stray. She promised more next time. Eventually I took pity on her and relented. Great fun.
Not sure if this is normal for her but she wrote her mobile on a card. I guess she does take away. For a fun time she is the pick of the 4 girls I've seen there but others will disagree.

 Maggie - VIP

Person's Name : Maggie

Establishment : VIP Health

Date of Visit : 03/10/12

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 08 9221 9887

Hours of Business : Open til late

Rates : 60mins / $65

Age : 30's

Size/shape : 12ish

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Was okay

My experience/comments : Finished work early so decided to head down. Paid my $65 and got ushered into the back room. Face down with clothes off, Maggie comes in and says she's training some new girls and wants to bring them in and I don't mind. She starts with a really strong massage (that I had requested) through the towel then eventually takes the towel off and continues to massage, every now and then focussing on the groin area. She applies the oil and keeps the massage strong, then tells the newbies to leave as she flips me over. She motions for HE @ $30 and I agree. She takes her time and doesn't rush, and knows how to build up nicely, and by the end of it I was one happy chappy! She cleans my body with a towel, then let's me know she'll be away for a month, but the new girls will be up and running by then. Overall not a bad experience...

Chalk, upped the pricing for what?  I was there the other day and business must be pretty bad... because it looked to me as if the girls were trying to cut each other off to get anyone who walks in the door.  I quite rightly stood my ground with the older lady and chose the younger girl on my visit... but I think the older lady is winning as she seems to be turning clients over whereas the other two seem to be languishing on the couch.

Was here over the weekend... some poor bastard got taken for a ride by the older lady; Helen... and my god... what a raving rant she gave... I was having my massage by one of the other girls and I overheard some guy come in for a massage... he was mentioning his shoulders and back being sore and went in for his massage... then when I heard Helen go into the room, she started commenting on what a nice arse the guy had and heard her slap him (presumably on said bum)... then through out the massage, I kept hearing conversation about nice skin, nice bum, blah blah... oh for the love of god... just be quiet... anyway, as I was in there for an hour and the other guy was only there for 30 minutes... about halfway through his massage, Helen asked him if he wanted any extra services... to which I heard him say "No, thank you."... the guy replied nicely and was very courteous... but geez, next thing you know, Helen starts to push him about "Why not?", "Why don't you want a HJ?"... then the poor guy said "Errr, perhaps next time?"... then the barrage got worse... Helen then started shouting "You won't be back, you only SAY next time!"... then she progressed on to that if he didn't want extras, then don't bother going to their shop!!  She went on about how hard it was to work as a massage lady and that they make their money from providing extra services and that if the guy wasn't going to partake in the extras, he should not have bothered to come to the shop!  Wow... I'm in the other room and she's going off at a customer like this!!  Then after about a 5 minute rant and rave.... she then tells the guy... "You owe me $10".... the poor guy then asks "Why?"... to which she replied something about because I was so nice and slapped your bum and rubbed your bum.... HOLY CRAP!... then I heard Helen go out of the room... the guy got changed and next thing I hear... Helen was blocking the guy from leaving the massage room and she said "Where's my $10?"... Poor guy asked "Do I really have to give you $10?".... Of course the reply was "YES!".... I presume he handed over the $10 because Helen's attitude changed... she then chirpily said "Thank you" and ushered the customer out the door.  OH MY GOD!!!! Has customer service in this shop turned into a shakedown of clients?  Poor guy only got about 15 minutes of his massage followed by about 10 minutes of being lectured and shouted at... and he took his last 5 minutes to get the hell out of Dodge.

I'm not a competing massage shop operator.... I'm purely a punter providing a recount of the events that occurred over the weekend.

I'm not returning to this shop, but I just provide the rest of you with a heads up if you do go.

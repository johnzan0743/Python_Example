My experience/comments : I highly recommend Jessica. 

Located next to the Woolworths Petrol Station with a big Massage Sign. You can't miss it. There is disable parking and a few parking bays behind the house/shop. 

I didn't make a booking and walked in. Was really quiet. I spoke to a lady at first and she didn't have good English and then I saw Jessica. I was so relieved someone could speak good English that I booked Jessica for 1 and half hours. For me I have to have a good massage too and its impossible if you can't communicate what you want done. 

The room I was shown was reasonable new. I believe it was the master bedroom because it has a shower and toilet. Got ready for my massage and only then noticed Jessica was a very beautiful lady. D Cup melons and amazing hands. Beautiful too. 

Most of the time I discount the massage at these places but she had a fantastic massage. Very strong and professional. At the end I was so relaxed all my stresses were gone before any funny business. Finished up with hj.

I would highly recommend her. I think most girls at this place are Chinese. You can't miss her. My only regret was to not ask for more extra. Has anyone else seen her or had other extras?

It would be great if we can find out if she is still in or if we can book her in.

Thanks, nice post.

Value for money/recommend? : If your after strong massage with no extras this is the place to go to. They usually do traditional thai massage or mixture of massage with oil. I recommend doing a oil thai massage or aromatherapy. Traditional thai massage is a dry massage and is more stretching type massage. As for the others they combined a range of massages which is very good. Its cheaper per hour if you do an hour and a half massage. The massage shop is not equip with bars so they can't do Back-stepping massage properly (for those who like super strong massage).

This place has all people trained in full thai style massage

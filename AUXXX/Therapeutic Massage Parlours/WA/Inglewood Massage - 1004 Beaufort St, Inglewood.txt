Nope, "milking" was another $30, as usual.

I visited this place a few weeks back. The woman who massaged me was a malaysian probably in her twenties, very friendly but not the greatest looking and a bit overweight. I asked for a half hour massage. The massage was okay but she didn't offer any extras, so I left very dissapointed. I guess you have to ask for extras here if you want them.

My experience/comments : This place is almost opposite the Perth concert hall and has large advertising on the front window. Arrived shortly before closing time. Mamasan seemed pleased to have a customer on a coolish evening. Paid $40 and was shown to a room. Got naked and lay on the massage table. There were good signs as there are tissues on the shelves containing the oils.

The massuese then arrives. She is is about 165cm, dark hair in a pony tail. Fills out her size 8 jeans beautifully and has a reasonable rack. Very nice body! On with the oil on my back followed by legs and she gives a good strong thai massage. Plenty of use of the forearms and elbows from on top of the table as well for more leverage. She worked my muscles really well. Unfortunately there has been no brushing of the boys during the leg massage so when I flip there is no hardon. This all changes as she gently massages my abs and works down to the inner thigh. I am picturing her in the nude and I am standing at attention. She smiles and mimmicks a tug with her hand, I smile and ask how much. She says $50, I respond that I normally pay $20. Well she would not budge. It took all my willpower not to think with my dick. So the finish did not happen. 

At the end she got nice warm towels and removed all the oil from the massage. As I left they also closed up shop and drover off. Obviously the final customer for the night. 

So, in summary a good massage, a hot massuese but in my opinion overpriced. As a result I left with big balls. Time to get a root    Fifteen minutes later I had this lined up. See next review.

Cheers

Is this the Rose Moon Day Spa ?

Your location near the Perth concert hall seems right in the guts of Corporate and Professional (chic) Perth.

Perhaps that's why the rates were non-negotiable.

Hey Fartichoke 

That address sounds about right. Not too much immediate competition nearby and ir is in the chic area which as you said may explain the non negotiable. Was just on a couple of days stop over there so cannot easily pop back and confirm.

Cheers

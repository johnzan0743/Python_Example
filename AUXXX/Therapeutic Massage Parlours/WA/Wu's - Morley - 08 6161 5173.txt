Person's Name : Chloe

Establishment : Wu's Massage 

Date of Visit : 2/10/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : corner of Russell street opposite the servo station (park in front of Bankwest, 5 or so doors down)

Hours of Business : 10 am til late

Rates : 50 p/h before 2pm special - confirmed!

Age : late 20's



Size/shape : average size 10

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai i think

Services Provided : massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend? : sort of

My experience/comments :

I walked in and enquired about the special.  "yes, yes, $50 for 1 hour"  i accepted and was lead to a room down the hall.  The walls are plastic and you can hear every bit of adventure in the neighbouring rooms.  I nudded up and waited for amonst 10 mins listening to the bloke in the next room completing his checklist for a website like this i reckon.  All the right questions.  

Chloe walks in, throws a towel over me and we get started... the massage itself was quite good but there was not one sign of anything else on offer.  come the last 15 mins i'm asked to turn over and she offers and montion of a HJ for $50, i say no, and offer $30... she accepts.  the HJ itself was ok but as she'd done zero teasing, it just wasn't as good as it could have been.  i was offered a shower or a towel.  cleaned up and left at the 60 minute mark.  Perhaps other ladies there will show a better time but based on Chloe, I doubt i will return.  

Can however confirm that the special is on!

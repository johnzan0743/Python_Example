Services Provided : massage/HE

Value for money/recommend? : A bit pricey but friendly and I would recommend. But stick with the massage/HJ. 

My experience/comments : The phone call was a bit of an adventure on its own getting thru the language barrier which was eventually sorted when the girl on the phone passed it to a dude who spoke reasonable English. When I arrived at the shop no dude was in sight and Angela who met me at the entry and did the massage was definitely not the girl who answered the phone. Angela spoke pretty good English. 

Angela was very friendly and gave me a hug and a little 'sisterly' kiss. I asked if she did 'extras' and she agreed to a HE for an additional $30. On the table and the massage was a very ordinary rub. She had the annoying habit of answering the phone during the service. But she did do plenty of tackle tickle and was very friendly giving me the occasional kiss on the back of my neck. She allowed me to touch her through her dress and she was very firm and trim underneath. 

On roll over she played with my nipples as well as gently kissing me as she was wanking my cock nicely. Again she allowed touching and with a bit more negotiating she was soon naked for a further $30. I played with and kissed her pert boobs and she let me touch the rest of her body but only on the outside. Angela knows what she's about and she soon had the desired outcome. 

A friendly lady Angela is also available in their other shop in Belmont so call to check when.

My experience/comments : 

Went in for half an hour, which cost me $65 all up if I remember correctly
Have been here a couple times before to see Lulu and Sarah on seperate occasions.
Summer is way definitely outgoing than the other girls at this establishment, although some of the other girls definitely have charms in their own way.

She has trained in massage and this shows as she worked her magic to get the day's tensions out of my muscles. Really good on my shoulders in particular.

When it was time to turn over she started talking a bit dirty which surprised me but also helped to get the old fella to start taking notice. She has a way with her hands, a bit of balls stroking and the feeling of her fingers and palms running over me made me get to the finish line a bit quicker than Im used to.
All in all a great time

Just to clarify, the = massage was $45 for half an hour and $20 tip for the happy ending =$65 
This is what i paid so Im not actually sure what the hourly rate. i think the $130 i qouted might be a bit much. I will check and get back with correct hourly rate.

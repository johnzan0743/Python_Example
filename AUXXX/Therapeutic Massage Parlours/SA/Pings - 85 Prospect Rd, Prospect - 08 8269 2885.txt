For my second session of the day I also found this shop in the Advertiser under Adult Relaxation Services and decided to try them as their prices were low.I don't know if this is a new shop but I had trouble getting through to them as the line was engaged for a long time and there were also a lot of calls taken while I was in the shop.
When I walked in there was a young one and an old one sitting on a couch and I was disappointed that the old one was first to jump up and greet me.My second disappointment came when I saw the massage cubicles,they were all just curtains and would have made any noise making activities either quite public or not possible at all.I still thought that possibly the lady who escorted me to a cubicle may have only been the money collector and that I may still have ended up with a young one but just to be safe I only booked a 30 minute session.Paid my $30,assumed the position and the same lady came back and started the massage.There was nothing remarkable about the first 15 odd minutes until I was given a pat on the sack and told to turn over.
Upon turning over the lady grabbed my dick and made the universal sign for oral sex and held up 4 fingers,which I declined.She then made the universal sign for hand relief and held up 2 fingers.I then countered with $30 for oral,to which she agreed.She then took my $30 and made the universal sign for keep it quiet and produced a condom,which I told her I didn't want and she agreed to do it without.The oral was not bad but was more her just putting her mouth over the head and then wanking me.With a few breathers in between she eventually took a load in her mouth and then deposited it into a tissue and she also allowed some wandering hands.The funny thing was that while I was getting my dick sucked I could hear another lady on the phone telling some bloke "No,just massage here"!
There was also a bloke in the next cubicle who turned up after me and got the young one and I'm pretty sure I heard her tell him that nothing else was on the menu so maybe I got lucky.Not bad for $60 all up-in Melbourne we are expected to believe that a tug on it's own should start at $30.
So far two loads away over 70 minutes for only $100.The day is going well.

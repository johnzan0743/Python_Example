 Can a master class massage lady make some quick cash in Adelaide ??
				
Post Content: 
This is a question for all you in the know brothers about the Adelaide RnT scene :

A friend of mind due to personal reasons has to depart Sydney to return home shortly. She has just got an offer to work in a RnT shop in Adelaide to make some quick cash before leaving Australia for good, according to the shop owner, ml like my friend with her skills and experiences, could easily make $500 a day just doing massage and RnT !

Comments please ?

Could it be the same friend. If so I met her for a late lunch today, she did mention areas like Newcastle but with her skills she could make a lot of money anywhere if she had some good advertising or promotion. I am happy that she has other friends who like me do really care about her. Thanks gentlemen, kindness is still alive with some!!!
Given her situation I would be happy for her if she decided to take up the offer

It all depends on whether she can continue to lease the house and work, if yes, she would much prefer to stay in Burwood and services all her regulars and new clients until she has to depart. But if she can't stay in the house, then she will take up the offer to go to Adelaide and work there as accommodation will be provided by the shop owner.

Yes I had my session cut short to accommodate your luncheon engagement. I was a bit pissed off but I know she appreciates your support so I didn't say anything but I would like to spend some quality time with her before she leaves our shores.

Sorry mate, she did not tell me that she was busy and I had told her that if she was busy I would wait as I had to see my dental surgeon on Saturday. Her mind is a bit all over the place at present, understandible, I would not intentionally impinge on your quality time with her.

OK our Burwood friend may be OK in Adelaide as the prices are a little higher but it would not be at a typical Chinese shop as they don't do B to B. More likely an illegal brothel where she may be able to choose what she does but would probably be pressured into doing FS. If accomodation is available it will typically be the room she is allocated to work in from what I know of that scene from a reliable source. Tell her to be careful as I would have assumed she is already making that in Burwood out of the comfort and safety of her own abode.

Yes she appears pretty busy at the moment which is great for her but unlucky for those of us who miss out. I am going to try and book her tomorrow afternoon about 4.00pm so to all you other fans: stay away!

Actually we are now meeting for lunch and then I am helping her with some paperwork and then, I hope, some fun. Should be all done by about 4 ish for anyone who wants a late afternoon booking! Please 'Do not Disturb'.

Driving along Payneham Rd last week, I noticed a massage shop, which I initially thought was probably legit. I'd been sitting on my arse for most of the day, so my lower back was killing me. I'd also unloaded a few hours prior so it would not have bothered me if I got just a straight massage. 

I was initially told to wait  2 mins, then 5 mins later I was told to wait another 5  mins. Just before I was about to walk out after waiting nearly 20mins, I was ushured into a cubicle. There are 5 or 6 cubicles with walls that don't go all the way up to the ceiling, so you can hear what is going on next door. There is just a curtain at the front of the cubicles.

During the time I was waiting, 4 guys came in and were also told to wait, so this place is super busy! I wasn't told the name of the lady who ended up massaging me, nor did I ask, but she was over 50 and unattractive. At least she gave a decent massage.

She did a lot of nice stroking between the legs which made the old fella stiffen up, so was standing to attention on the flip. She had little to no English, but got the message to me clearly enough by performing a wanking motion in the air with her wrist and pointing to my dick with her other hand. I said ok and away she went. Unfortunately, I was unable to blow a load, possibly because I had done so a few hours prior or possibly because I overdid the Prozac back in the mid 90's .

Having blokes either side within ear shot may have been another reason... 

Total damage was just $30 for the half hour, including the HJ so this must be the cheapest place around for a wristy and good massage. Don't think I will be returning though, even if I get a more attractive lady because of the lack of privacy. Hearing the sound of the bloke next door being jerked off is a bit of a turn off to say the least, but each to his own. As I said, this place is really buzzing so the lack of privacy obviously isn't an issue for everyone.

Had to go to Adelaide for work and after doing some prior research on this forum I was not expecting to find much in the way of happy ending massages.To my surprise I found nearly a page worth of ads for "Adult Relaxation Services" in the Advertsier so I tried this one first.
I parked in the deserted public car park around the back and used the rear entrance.There were 2 older asian ladies at the back door,both wearing casual clothes and one of them showed me inside while the other tried to get some sort of large flying insect to leave the shop.
This shop is set up with cubicles which have timber dividing walls that do not reach the ceiling and curtains for doors,so privacy is not great although at the time I was the only customer.I chose a 40 minute session,paid my $40,got naked and assumed the position.The lady asked what pressure I wanted,which is always good as some of them just start pounding away.
About 5 minutes into the session another customer walks in the front door and asks in a loud,heavily accented voice if they only do massage.The other lady tells him the prices and he keeps asking if they do anything else.She either doesn't understand him or doesn't want to and tries to convince him to stay for a 30 minute session.He then says "I don't want a massage,I want something else" and I think he was probably trying to get her to understand with hand gestures.She continued to try to get him to stay but then he started asking about other any ladies to be told "other lady busy".He eventually gave up and said he would come back another day-I wish him all the best.
Meanwhile I continued to enjoy a very good massage with no incidental touching or hint of any extras and after about 25 minutes I was asked to turn over.To my surprise,as soon as I turned over the lady started oiling up my dick and it was clear that we were off to the races.I got a nice tug that got me over the line but she wasn't keen on me touching anywhere but her back and legs so I respected her wishes.I still wasn't sure if I had to pay any extra for the tug but after cleaning me up she left the cubicle and didn't return so by that stage I was pretty sure we were settled and that was indeed correct.All up I don't think I got the full 40 minutes but when you get a good massage from a nice lady and a tug is included,who really cares?

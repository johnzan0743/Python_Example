    Value for money/recommend?: o/k but thought Blue room was better. read my review for that.

    My experience/comments: This is a duplex house . I did not make a booking and was told after calling there were a few girls available turned up met the lady in charge, an older Aussie woman and was told only lexi was available unless I wanted to wait. Chose Lexi. After paying for an hour was asked to lay face down on the table. Lexi stripped down to nude and then started to massage. Not bad, not great nothing real sensual . Was o/k. After about 25 minutes was asked to turn over. she would rub my legs and chest , go to my rude bits and then back to the legs and chest. Every time I tried to touch her she moved out of arms length. After about 10-15 minutes she finished the job on my rude bits . I have better and I have had worse. We still had about 20 minutes so she continued on a basic massage.
    There is a decent shower and the rooms are privatebedrooms. Did see a real cutie on the way out so there is talent there.

Great playing with those boobs, no problems with some pussy play and a great finish.
Indicated that she was open to an exchange massage. Will definitely look forward to paying her another visit.

[COLOR=#333333]This chick was awesome! Actually gave a good massage! She stripped down to nothing as soon as she came back from doing the cash thing. My god are those some Norks!!!!

Massage was firm yet sensual and she got right into my arae which I love. She allowed ample touching which is always a great bonus.

Extras not offered but I think they may be on the cards next time. After I turned over she hopped on top and gave a wicked bodyskide using those tits to perfection. When tug time came she jerked my weiner all over her tits which was a damn good site.

Definately recommend as she is just a really cool chick with massive natural hooters![/COLOR]

 Purple Sofa - March 2013 - Holly
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Holly
Establishment : Purple Sofa 
Date of Visit : March 2013
Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Adult Content Warning 
Rates : $180/hour, plus extras
Age : late 20s
Size/shape : 10DD, 5'10
Nationality or Ethnicity : aussie
Services Provided : massage, HE, spanish, pussy play, body slides, DATY
Value for money/recommend? : Yes

First, the admin. My booking was arranged by simple exchange of email two weeks in advance, based on the detailed roster on their website. (I was keen for this girl and I knew when I was going to be in town). I got a prompt reply, and all was good save for being quoted stupid rate for a 90 minute booking. So I stuck to 60 minutes. 

Purple Sofa is a house on South Road, about half way between Henley Beach Road and Don Bradman Drive. There's a tall fence across the front yard that provides reasonably private off-street parking. You enter via a discrete door down the far side of the house. (The house is old, and looks run-down from the outside, but it's just camouflage. The interior is much nicer.)

I was shown through to a room with a leather sofa (not purple) and a massage table with a centrepiece of a towel arranged decoratively with a spray of flowers to top it off. Ah, the little touches! High ceilings, deep ochre red walls, and large mirrors on three walls gave the room a good feel. And a portable air-conditioning unit in one corner kept everything pleasant given the furnace-like weather outside.

Holly came in and we discussed what was on offer. She told me some girls do extras. When I asked if she did, she told me it depends on the punter. We left the possibility open, to be revisited later. She took my basic hour charge and left me to get undressed. 

Now the girl. Holly is tall, slim, and pretty. Holly was also 6 months pregnant. This has its pluses and minuses. Yes, she has some stretch marks on her belly. But she is still tall and slim and pretty, and pregnancy has done great things for her wonderfully firm breasts. DD things. And her pregnancy was a major turn-on for me. CASG. YMMV.

Holly is no shrinking violet. If you want demure, you'll be disappointed. She talked quite a bit through the session, but it was friendly banter, and it added to the GFE from my perspective. 

She gave me a pretty thorough massage, with opportunity to feel her up as she was working, followed by a superb body slide. The mirrors came into their own here; the view was remarkable. Holly told me her body sliding technique was something she had to reassess every week given her condition, but she had certainly worked it out this week.

After the flip, she pretty quickly moved to working on my cock and balls, while placing her aforementioned breasts in easy reach. After some light kissing, she moved into classic female superior 69 position, but with her pussy at a distance from my face. She was happy to be thoroughly felt up, and it was at this point I opened the negotiations for DATY.

"I want to lick you."
"Maybe," she replied.
"How about $50"
"Ok"

So maybe the optimal technique for haggling is to start low, and I might have secured dining privileges for less, but at that stage the point was just to get her neat twat in contact with my mouth as soon as possible. She backed up the critical 30cm. She seemed to enjoy my efforts. I certainly did. And before long it was mission accomplished.

Afterwards she led me down the hall to a shared bathroom for a shower (to be expected given the age of the building), and they called me a taxi. 

All in all, I left very satisfied with Holly. She was great fun. WIR? Yes, although I didn't have the opportunity. She is now off the menu for a while.

CASG? Chacun à son goût. Each to their own taste.

 Massage - The Purple Sofa (Chanel)

Person's Name : Chanel

Establishment : The Purple Sofa

Date of Visit : June 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : thepurplesofa.com.au

Rates : $175 an hour

Age : 21-25

Size/shape : C to D, slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Caucasian

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : not really

My experience/comments :
Decided to give Purple Sofa a go, was impressed by some reviews and the photos on their websites. Made a booking and turned up to play pot luck - well was impressed by both Chanel and Tia. Both seemed friendly and were attractive. Decided to go with Chanel.

Well she came back and got undressed, wow, what a great body and as others have stated she has a great set of tits. Brief chit chat but then silence....the massage seemed a bit half hearted, felt good but she just seemed a bit more interested at looking at herself in the mirror, not surprising with the large mirrors I was enjoying the via as well.

On the flip she did a bit of a body slide and then some light teasing before finishing me off with a good tug, not great but I wasn't complaining.

Offered a shower but not sponge down, just given a couple of wipes to wipe off the oil...no sponge down's at purple sofa ?

The disappointing thing was once we were getting dressed we had a chat and laugh and I though where was that personality during the session ?

I wouldn't say I'd go back, but if you just want to enjoy looking at a beautiful, tanned woman who gives a reasonable tug then go for it and see how you go. However I've since read a couple of reviews that had similar experiences.

Happy punting !

Age : 21-25

Size/shape : B, slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : not really

My experience/comments :

Decided on the need for a good massage and some relief, found myself near the purple sofa so made a call, couple of girls available so come on in for intro. On entering found the waiting room interesting, not sure how you go with another punter turning up....anyway intro to Jenny, cute little asian (and I mean little) and bigger blonde with some tatts, her name escapes me. Jenny was my first choice so upstairs we go for the business.

Jenny speaks well and really enjoys herself. Being tiny she really can work the table well, spent most of her time on top and provides plenty of relaxing strokes and gives the boys are few cheeky gropes for good measure. The body slides are great and she seems to enjoy teasing you into thinking she would offer more, almost GFE foreplay. On the flip and she's happy on top, a few more body slides and it's time to finish. She was happy to stay on top for the finish, almost a bit of mish but using the hand, quite erotic and certainly enjoyed and appreciated.

Good eye contact and a happy, cheeky nature.

Overally a good exprience and you couldn't go wrong enjoying her talents.

My experience/comments : Tia is a friendly girl who offers a 15min lapdance before a 30min massage and tug. $160 was the damage.
Unfortunately, I found the lapdance to be not much different from a standard lappy that you can get at clubs like Goldfingers in Melbourne or at the Crazy Horse in Adelaide, with probably more rules! It didn't flow and certainly didn't get me going.  This meant that the mood for the massage wasn't great and an ordinary finish.
My experience wasn't great but YMMV!

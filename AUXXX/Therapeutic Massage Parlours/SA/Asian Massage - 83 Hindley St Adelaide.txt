My experience/comments : 

On a business trip and walking back to the hotel after dinner, I thought I'd walk along the infamous massage joints along Hindley St. I decided to give 103 a miss due to crap reviews, and 128 was closed by this stage.

I walked into no 83 and a pretty little thing with nice c or d cups asked me to sit down for a few minutes. She then ushered me into a private cubicle and asked me to take my clothes of and place them in the washing basket on the floor. Given that there were no signs about leaving underwear on, I took her quite literally and lay face down on the table. In she comes and asks if I want soft or hard  hard I say.
Her massage is quite good, and she explains that my back is quite tense. I think she is probably right, but wonder if this is a ploy to get me to return for 'more work'. Anyway, she does not come close to the tackle, and at the 20 min mark or so she starts on my neck. I ask her if I can turn over  'no, because I am still doing your neck', ok then. Few minutes later and she goes out to get the towel to dry off the oil  'OK' I think. Once that's done.. she says 'time's up'! Not what I had expected, but it was clear enough that nothing was on the cards. She did ask I wanted to extend my time another $60 for 30 min? No thanks.

Nice enough girl and a quite good massage, but value for money?.probably not this time.

 Asian Massage - 188 Morphett St, Adelaide - 0469 913 323

G'day all.

After the relative disappointment of the Hindley St premises I knew there had to be somewhere better in the Adelaide CBD.

Well I found one - 188 Morphett St.   (Ph 0469 913323).   It is a normal looking massage place and the owner told me they have only been open a month or so.

I got a massage for $95/hr including a HJ at the end.  The owner was a Chinese lady  named Mary/Maree.  Premises is very new and nice, 3 good sized and private massage rooms.  Mary's massage was very good as I needed a firm lower back massage.   The HJ was so-so but did the job.  Not very erotic, no build up - quite mechanical - I had to prompt her to not forget to give the ballbags some attention!   However, warm towels at the end ensured a nice, relaxing clean-up before departure!

Mary is about 35-40yo, roughly size 10-12, and reasonable looking.   She spoke English ok and does not do 'outcalls' to hotels but possibly would if she knew you well after a few visits.   She even mentioned (when I asked) she could even take her gear off if I was very nice to her and she got to know me but for the time being she doesn't!  She mentioned there were 2 other ladies working there, one from Laos/Thailand also but I didn't get to see them but the way she described them they sounded nice!

The shop opens at 9:30 and closes late, actual time depends on how busy they are, but Mary mentioned when they were busy the other night they closed at 2am.

Will definetly go back and try and see a different lady but the premises is about the best I've seen for a rnt.   Enjoy!!!

Gday again.   Went back on Sunday night and found the shop still open at 10pm.   Maree again the only lady on.   I asked about the girl from Laos and she said that she's on holidays until around the 25th.   Think she said her name is Karen or something like that and she was around 25yo.   So I give her my money anyway as I needed a good firm massage with extras!

The time with her was similar to last time - very good massage but only a fair RnT.   She doesn't even touch your cock or balls until it's time to 'rollover' which is a shame as I like a bit of a build up and tease.

So I'll go again -perhaps next month and try and give a review of the other girl(s).

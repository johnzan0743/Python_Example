I have learned that the legal status of RnT joints is different in SA to NSW.  Does anyone know the exact law on this?

Anyway, saw this place advertised in the paper ages ago.  Keen to go there but does anyone know where it is?  They seem to have stopped advertising and I can't find them on the web, which makes me wonder if it is illegal in SA and they were closed down.

Adelaide comes under an ancient law - the 1956 Summary offences act

This covers full service r&t escorting

Basically whilst it's not illegal to "sell" sexual services, it is illegal to be on premises without good reason

So this essentially means the industry including r&t is illegal

Having said that though, it is tolerated to an extent by police and few raids happen, mostly only if they suspect drugs, immigration issues, underage, links to organized crime

Experience - Zoe was the only lady available with 4 others busy as per the receptionist. Intro and thought average however I was horny so decided to stay.  I had been here years before for an average session however was willing to give another go - not my best decision as you will read below. 

Waited 15 minutes for Zoe to appear - WTF ? 1st indication of now expected average service. 

Go to room - it was freezing and spend 5 minutes getting heat going. Then she wants to go to the toilet - 5 minutes more wasted !! 

Finally she comes in and invites me to unzip her - ahh, maybe now will get better!! Slight grope of tits and I offer to finish undressing her - she moved away and did a slow strip finally removing G string 

Onto the table and massage begins - oil up my body and oils herself - maybe all will be ok?!?

Massage then for 35 minutes (I had only booked45 minutes!)- a bit if tease and lots if her looking at herself in the mirror wih nothing stirring for me yet. Turn over and more massage now of neck - please, please go for my cock!  

Eventually goes there but just quick rubs and difficult to get to stir as just no real tug. I get a feel of her tits and go for her pussy but hand pushed aside. 

Take my cock into my own hand and she starts to masturbate herself - ahh, now hard and offer her my cock - more teasing but no real rub. 

I had asked if anything else on offer however time just too short and I am not willing to fork out more anyway - she did suggest maybe for next time. 

Knock on door - with only 5 minutes left, I tug myself again until near completion and then finally she properly rubs me off.  

Showered to remove oil - she joins me in the shower but doesn't offer to wash me. I complete the job, dry off, dress and leave. 

I will not return

Value for money/recommend? : too expensive


My experience/comments : Was visiting Adelaide on business and feeling very toey. There are no decent AMPs in central Adelaide so tried this joint that came up on google. Its a high-end legit sort of place that openly advertises R&T (but no more) as part of its service. It advertises a range of girls of various types and ethnicities. I popped in without appointment about 11pm and Arianna was only one available. BBW not my type, but it didn't put me off, I will try anything once.

The room was large, very classy and clean with mirrors all around. Arianna tried to be friendly but nevertheless a bit cold. Her massage was quite routine with lots of teasing. Because I could see her in the mirror I could see she wan't into it. This sort of ruined it for me.

On the flip, she proceed with mechanical HJ and allowed me to feel her snatch. But I wasn't getting into it, because she wasn't. But I got over the line in the end.

All in all, for what you pay, this is not value for money.

My experience/comments : Had a few hours before the plane so i walked Hindley St and decided on Sakura Massage as i could see the girls thru the window just sitting there. Tutu jumped up and offered an oil massage and i said full body? she smiled and said yes. Had barely got my clothes off and onto the table and she was back in the room. Her english is okay and we had a reasonable conversation as she gave me a very hard massage that had me groaning. The shop has several rooms all in a row, with doors, and 3/4 high walls. She put a towel over me and exposed the bits she needed as she went along, at one stage she was on the table digging her knees into my back. As each section was completed the oil was wiped off with some paper towel. While her personality was warm and her hands were experienced there was never any stray touches even when i flipped. She did however get a good look at my throbbing member as she worked my left leg. Must say i was a little disappointed but also glad to get a very good massage.

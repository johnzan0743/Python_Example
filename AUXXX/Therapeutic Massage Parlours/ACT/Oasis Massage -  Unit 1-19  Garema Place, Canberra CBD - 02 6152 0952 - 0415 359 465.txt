I decided to sample Kenny's again and in particular Annie's "soft / relaxation" massage.  Phoned Kennys ahead to make a booking and was advised that Annie was currently shopping in the Canberra Centre and I could either meet her at Kenny's or at the new premises above the TAB in Garema Place.  I opted to meet at the new premises as I wanted to have a look around. Waited outside, trying not to be too conspicuous (it really is rather exposed with a few coffee shops all within close proximity plus restaurants and of course the TAB).  

Annie recognised me and greeted me warmly and proudly showed me around.  The insides are quite nicely furnished especially the reception. She left me to nude up in the room and FMD knocks on the door just when I had only removed my shirt and shoes.  She went away for a few minutes (even though I asked her to stay) whilst I removed the rest of my clothes and lay on my stomach with a towel covering my butt.

"Hard, medium or soft massage?" I was asked.  I replied "Soft / Relaxation".  Annie commenced with a very good massage of my neck and shoulder whilst standing at the head of the massage table with her belly pressing onto my head.  When she moved to the side of the table to massage my back I felt her pussy rubbing lightly against my arm which was hanging down the table.  Hmmm, this immediately got little ABC's attention and he started to swell.  She moved around to the other side of the table and did the same.  Annie then commenced a teasing massage of my butt with brushes around my anal area and light touches of my sack and the head of little ABC who was fully erect.  "You like, you ok?" Annie asked in a sensuous voice.  "Oh yeah, you have great massage skills" I replied with a laugh.   "Just relax and enjoy" said Annie in a knowing voice.  From then on, I got one of the most sensuous RnT massages I have had for a very long time, each stroke of massage ending with a massage of little ABC through my legs, a brushing on and around the rim of my anus or light squeezing of my balls.  She even gave special attention to my perineum.  I was glad I had emptied my balls the night before or I reckon I would have cum within 30 minutes of the massage beginning with this amount of TT.

After the wipe down of my back with hot towels I was asked to turnover and Annie commenced a light teasing of little ABC whilst quoting rates for extras.  Her HJ on my cock was very measured and light enough to keep me on the brink for a very long time whilst I lightly caressed her butt.  Eventually she increased the intensity of her HJ and  I shot a load on my stomach and chest.

Annie cleaned me up with more hot towels, I paid her in the room and she gave me a Kenny's Massage card with both the Northbourne Ave and Garema Place address on it.  At this stage, a name for the new premises has not been worked out. I think she mentioned she is opening her Garema Place shop officially next week but is happy to massage clients there now.  She will be going to Sydney next week sometime to train up a few girls.  She is quite enthusiastic and excited about more people visiting her at these premises.

I was on my way to Kenny's but knew only Gina and Kelly was on duty and wanted to try someone different so I made a detour to pass by Oasis Massage.  Surprisingly, there was not many people hanging around the coffee shops etc so I ducked in.

Michelle greeted me at the desk looking particularly sexy in her abbreviated black shorts (the style that shows a hint of ass cheek :P ) and a tight T-shirt showing a bit of bust.  I was led into one of the rooms and noticed it was pretty warm in there even though the air-cond was on.  I guess as it was a pretty hot day and they were on the first floor.  I also noticed whilst the fit out was very nice and modern, the walls did not go right up to the ceiling in each of the rooms.  (I hadn't noticed this the last time I was there but I guess because I was the only one in there at the time).  I could clearly hear a conversation going on in the room next door and it turned out it was Lisa with a client.

I undressed and lay on my stomach with a towel draped modestly over me.  Michelle came back into the room and I commented that I had remembered her when she was still in training during October last year.  It became obvious that her English was not that good as she had trouble grasping what I was prattling on about.  A bit of a pity as she was quite attractive and curvy and I do like to have a little conversation during the massage.

Michelle removed the towel but  did not start with the usual pressure point massage that most gals at Kenny's seem to do but sloshed a fair amount of oil on my back and commenced a pretty good massage of my neck, shoulders with the occasional longer strokes down to my butt.  It was relaxing as I had asked for a soft / medium massage but when she was massaging my neck I could feel she seem to have a lightly calloused finger on one of her hands.  

After finishing my back, Michelle climbed on top of the table and knelt behind me with one knee between my thighs and I could feel her knee pressing lightly against the head of little ABC which was quite sensual whilst she was moving slightly with the massage.   She then commenced a fairly extensive massage of my butt without any further TT beside the slight touching of her knee against me.  She then hopped off and massaged each of my legs, with lots of TT thrown in.  It wasn't the light subtle TT that one normally gets but quite obvious, I almost came there and then!  Upon the flip, she massaged my chest and upper thighs before asking if I wanted a happy ending which I accepted.  She oiled little ABC up and gave quite a competent HJ and I was relieved I didn't actually feel any of the calloused fingers on my shaft (maybe it was on her other hand ).

After finishing up, was wiped down with hot towels and made my way to the desk to pay and greeted by the ever jolly Lily.  

As I made my way downstairs, I noticed the lunch time crowd had gathered around the entrance so put my sunnies on, put my head down and walked quickly through the crowd .

I tried booking a massage with a couple of independents advertising on Cracker today but both were busy so decided to visit Oasis and see who I would be lucky enough to get.  Surprisingly, not too many people around the entrance so I ducked quickly in.

Lily was the only one in this morning and guided me to the last room down the corridor - this was promising! 

As I was left on my own to undress, I noticed the walls that previously had went up 7/8th to the ceilings in each room have now all been extended right up to the ceiling so that is good from a privacy aspect.

I lay on my stomach in the nude as the towel was on a table at the end of the room and it was a hot day anyway.  Lily came back in and I noticed she had dispensed with the baggy long sleeve shirt and was now in a sexy pair of shorts and a fairly tight fitting T-shirt all of which showed she had trimmed down considerably from the last time I have had a massage from her.

After a short pressure massage on my back, butt and legs with the towel covering me, Lily commenced her usual high quality medium strength oil massage on my shoulders, neck, back, butt and legs.  Whilst massaging my legs there was a fair bit of TT which had little ABC showing interest.  

Interestingly, when Lily went out to prepare a hot towel for the wipedown, she closed the door fully, even though I was the only client in the premises.  Maybe feedback from BK has been taken into account!

After the wipe down and another short pressure point massage,  I was asked to turn over and a pillow was placed under my head.  Lily commenced a nice massage of my chest, leaning over my face as she was at the head of the table and I could feel her breasts lightly brushing past me.  Gradually she worked her way to my stomach and groin and I was now standing to attention.  Lily commenced a slow teasingly HJ no further prompting required from me and increased the tempo slightly until I shot my load.

For me, Lily still gives the best full body oil massage, whether sensual or therapeutic at Kenny's / Oasis and also gives an excellent head massage too.  She gave me a 5 minute scalp massage before my time was up and I almost fell asleep - it was that relaxing! 

The crowd had gathered outside for their coffee break etc as I left and these two bozo's sitting on a bench directly in front of the door gave me the evil eye as I exited the building

Nice one ABC, Lily told me she goes to the gym above Kennys massage daily to keep shape. She gives really good therapeutic massage, I sometimes go for massage only. She is a smart independent lady, single with multiple properties in Sydney.

Asked one of the ladies, whether they provide RnT to female clients, the answer is no, since they are not sexually attracted to females, they found it awkward to perform. Asked whether any female clients requested, answer is not common in Canberra, more often in Sydney. They had female clients asking for full sex, they often dresssed very well and professionally. Interesting.

My experience/comments: 

After some discussion with ABC_Bonker we decided a team visit was in order to more properly assess this shop .  With this in mind, ABC booked both of us in for 1 hour massages at the appointed date/time.  I hasten to add, not in the couples room .

Met up with ABC at a nearby rendezvous and proceeded to the target shop, donning sunglasses and hat enroute – too hot for the trench coat .

As previously described this shop is easy to find, centrally located with plenty of nearby shopping centre parking and an easy walk from the Civic bus interchange.  I agree with ABC re the rather public entrance door facing one of the main social areas in Civic – certainly not ideal.

We ascended the stairway to level 1 to be met at the top of the stairs by Lisa.  Introductions were made and Lisa was most welcoming, I found her outgoing, vivacious and quite attractive.    I had been booked with Lily and ABC with Lisa, no sign of Lily and leaving ABC behind, Lisa showed me through to one of the rear rooms.  Nice new shop fit-out – very clean.  Lisa pointed to the table and told me to take all clothes off, Lily be along in a minute.  I followed instructions and Lily came in after several minutes.  Like Lisa, Lily is a mature age PRC girl, I also found her quite attractive.  I made the point at the beginning by showing Lily the $110 with the $30 being a tip for HJ.  Big smile and thank you from Lily.  

Massage starts dry through a towel for a couple of minutes then towel folded over my knees and oil massage on back/bum/legs.  Pretty good therapeutic massage, similar to Katy’s at CPM.  During the early part of the massage I try to strike up a conversation with Lily but it turns out her English language skills are not the best and we ultimately lapsed into silence.   Speaking of silence, what I was able to hear was Lisa chattering away – I assume to ABC, with the occasional silence followed by much girlish giggling. What was ABC up to with Lisa in the next room?   My imagination was running overtime .  Only ABC can tell us I guess.

By the time we have got to the 30 min mark, while Lily’s massage was quite enjoyable and therapeutic, it was somewhat lacking in the sensual/erotic side.  Ultimately with about 15 min to go Lily went and got a hot towel to clean the oil off my back and then asked me to roll over.  She gave a token massage of my legs and then put her hand on little Ant and asked if I wanted HJ.  At this stage I realised Lily had not understood me at the beginning of the massage WRT tip and HJ.  Given little Ant was still half asleep, I would have thought Lily would have commenced with some teasing first to wake him up ………… nope, what appeared to be a whole litre of oil was applied and straight into fairly mechanical HJ.  In the end this just wasn’t doing it for me and as out time was up, I indicated to her not to worry about it, this caused Lily a little concern which she very quickly got over.  Final cleanup with hot towel and Lily leaves me to get dressed.

Once I am dressed, back to reception where ABC is busy chatting up both girls.  I managed to extract him from Lisa’s clutches  and out we go back to reality, a reviving coffee and comparing of notes.

This visit, I really didn’t “click” with Lily (I have been spoilt at CPM).  Based on other reviews I suspect with repeat visits Lily might prove to be a winner as her general massage skills are excellent. Perhaps she was just having an off day.

In closing a big thank you to ABC for organizing this event. 

Summary
•	Excellent new/clean premises.
•	Very public entrance
•	WIR?  Yes, probably try one of the other girls – Lisa for preference.

My experience/comments : Yoko is a new girl.....much younger and prettier than some of her colleagues. On my first visit to her a few days back she was sensational. Provided a better than average hard massage, with an increasing amount of sensual contact from both of us as the massage progressed.

On the flip there was virtually unrestricted touching from both of us while she administered a fabulous HE.  I think she is heading back to Asia in June....there may be more services available if you get to know her.

Braved the cold and foggy morning and made my way up the stairs of Oasis Massage.  The pros of making a relatively early start on such a wintery morning was there was hardly anyone around sipping on their Latte's 

I decided I wouldn't make a booking and just have a take a chance on who I get but was secretly hoping for Michelle.  Met by Lily #2 descending the stairs as I was ascending.  She had a new shorter hairstyle which gave her a more youthful appearance and looked trimmer :P  Upstairs was greeted by two new faces (Susan and Amy) and was led by Amy into the first room.  Susan looked a bit more attractive and aged mid 40's however Amy, whilst not overweight, was heavier looking and looked around the mid to late 40's but fairly attractive looking.  I asked for an hour medium massage and was left alone to undress.

Amy came in promptly after I had draped myself on the table and commenced a fairly good oil massage after pulling down the towel to cover my legs but exposing my buttocks.  Initially there was some light TT as she massaged my legs but this gradually intensified as the massage when on, especially when she was massaging my legs and focussing on massaging my groin muscles.

Amy has had a stint massaging on the Gold Coast and her English is quite good compared to some of the others at Oasis / Kenny's.

Towards the end of massaging me whilst I was on my tummy there was a fair bit of focus on the the groin muscles which didn't do much for me but did allow Amy to give lots of TT, at one point mercilessly teasing the head of not so little ABC  with light touches with the tips of her fingers.

Just after the halfway mark, she asked me to turn over and commenced a fairly light one hand massage of my chest and upper legs, all the while lightly stroking a rather rampard little ABC.

We continued our conversation with Amy lightly stroking little ABC until I couldn't hold on any longer and she picked up the pace with her stroking to facilitate emptying my balls for me.

After wiping me down with warm towels, Amy gave me a nice scalp and foot massage before my time was up. She is going back to the Gold Coast for two weeks next week so I look forward to seeing her upon her return 

PS: 

I have been back several times since and have tried Susan too but Amy has not returned as yet - significantly longer than the said two weeks.

Gina use to work mostly at Kenny's  but has recently moved to Oasis. Both shops are owned by the same person anyway. There are reviews of her in there and i thought she was the "pregnant " lady that turmed you down for a 30min massage the last time you were in town? 🤔

Age : Around mid to late 30s, possibly even older

Size/shape : Petite, 155 cm, size 4 with B's

Services Provided : Nude RnT, FIV, body slide (more action = >$)

Value for money/recommend? : On par with some of the girls there

My experience/comments: 

Apologies for the delay in reviewing. Following up on other punter's reviews, I decided to try out Yoko for myself. 

Being gestured into the first room right near the counter, I requested a room further from the prying ears of that location. That twigged to Yoko that I wanted something more. Upon accepting the new room location, I was left to my own devices to undress, to which I did. Yoko knocks and enters shortly afterwards and gestures to the table.

Explaining to her that I only had 30 mins to play, she quickly asks me what I would like. I get off the table and pull out a pineapple from my wallet. Upon accepting said money, Yoko undresses to show me a petite size 4 frame with just approaching B breasts with very erect nipples and a not quite trimmed bush. Noticing that I manscape, she comments that she prefers a more hairy undercarriage. Each to their own.

A little bit of oil and the body slide commences. Didn't last too long along the back but that was expected for only a 30 minute ride. Upon the flip and another body slide continues, as before only briefly again. Conversations about how she's only on a tourist visa and taking money offshore starts, and what was alluded before in previous posts, that she intends to return to Malaysia with her newly acquired loot. I digress.

Body slide over, and with mini me saluting, she commences the tug with some lotion for added measure. I get to run my hands all over; seems like no part is out of bounds, which is tested when my hands go south to deal with the man in the canoe... quite moist down there and soon after a finger, then another goes in for the kill. My fingering is in rhythm with her stroking/nipple play and as she gets closer to (seemingly) climax, she bends forward to muffle a moan and quiver.

Recovering, she attacks mini me with gusto and commences a vigorous stroke in double quick time. Her head is quite close to where the action is and as I approach I let her know; a week's worth of celibacy shoots out, smacking me in the chest. She comments that she would have copped it square in the face if I was less gentlemanly, so to speak.

She puts on her clothes after cleaning me up, exits to get some towels and finishes the protein removal process. She mentions that she does offer more; but with exponential price increases that unbalances the costs benefit and return on investment. Perhaps if she was here for longer I would take her up on it, purely out of curiosity and personal gratification.

Don't think I'll be able to make it back before she leaves - it was worth it, which others have attested to.

Services Provided : Massage, RnT plus extras

Value for money/recommend? : Outstanding Service

My experience/comments: 

All I can say is wow. I had seen Youko quite a while ago at Kennys, but then she dropped off the radar for quite a while. After seeing some “Youko” reviews I wondered is was he same person so went and checked it out myself. When I arrived at Oasis I was pleasantly surprised that it was the same Youki so booked an hour with her.

The initial massage was awesome, almost unchanged from the last time I saw her, but where there was immense improvement was in the erotic stakes with plenty of tackle play an rubbing while on my stomach with lots of reciprocated touching and playing.

Soon it was time to turn over where the touching and playing (by me) continued followed by a quick offer to strip down for $50. Hell yes and off the clothes came. This was new territory with Youko and she didn’t disappoint with lots of passionate kissing, body slides, a bit of Spanish and generally lots of teasing.

Needless to say I was in heaven and took no time to get over the line.

After the clean up, Youko used the remaining time to provide a very relaxing head and shoulder massage.

Once time was up, as she has done in the past, she dressed me, gave me a huge kiss and hug goodbye and out the door I was.

Absolutely outstanding.

My experience/comments:

Offline for a little while and once back in the ACT went back to Old Faithful.

Hadn't seen Michelle in a while so decided to give her a return punt to see whether anything had changed. 

Sandpaper hands aside, the massage was it's usual self - once I asked for less oil. I did notice that there are now A4 printed signs in the rooms in Chinese saying 'no sexual services offered' or words to the effect of. Yeah right. 15 mins of massage ended up in 45 mins of nakedness from her as well as DATY, FIV, but sadly nothing more. She's lot a bit of weight since I last saw her, and commenting about that got mini me a little bit more attention.

She actually doesn't like FIV, so I maintained my composure and started to play with the man in the canoe. A passing comment from her was that she preferred the disco stick rather than the finger in her. Don't know what that insinuated but I don't think she's up for FS in the MP. It did possibly mean that if you saw her away from the MP and decided to spend some time in a room away from there, you may get more. 

Time spent with the right result and I got myself cleaned up. Is there more on offer? Perhaps. Depends on how far you're willing to go (and how much you're willing to spend!)

Services Provided: Tits out RnT, Spanish, cock tease

Value for money/recommend?: Meh

My experience/comments:

Trying to get Michelle a second time without a booking resulted in a strikeout. Mona offered herself to me and a decided to take a punt. Only had 30 mins to spare so decided for a quick one.

If you're looking for a decent massage then Mona is not for you. Pretty much as I walked into one of the rooms I was manhandled, stripped and put onto the table. Lots of TT and nipple caressing/sucking followed toplessness from her, and a bit of Spanish. Her tongue waggled as she played with me - she wanted $100 for a CBJ. No thanks. Kept with the Spanish and eventually got access down below, flicking the bean getting her pretty wet.

The 'no sexual services' photocopy was still there; moreso a cover-your-arse measure for the business rather than enforcement of the rule. 

Continuous slapping of mini-me across her breasts and pseudo Spanish resulted in a quick result. The tub of water was produced and I was expertly cleaned up. Somewhat afterthought head massage finished off the rather quick session.

WIR: Felt sort of mechanical. Perhaps it may be different if I had longer to indulge.

Value for money/recommend?: So so

My experience/comments:

I walked into without booking, most ladies were available, Mona took me to the first room, asked me to take everything off.

Her massage is actually really good, quite therapeutic and firm, a bit of accidental touch here and there. On the flip, did a nice foot massage for me with my feet in hot water, it was nice. The RnT part was ok, she let me play with her tits and access down below, it was quite wet, not long before I blew the load.

Overall, Mona is not very attractive, service is quite mechanical, RnT part was just standard without much enthusiasm. 

I won't go with her again in the future.

My experience/comments: After a long absence, I dropped in this week....still a bit put off by the very public entrance from Garema Place.....but running short of options on a busy afternoon.

Three quite good looking ML's sitting behind the desk....obviously Mona's turn....firstly she tried to up-sell me to a 
"4-hands" massage....which I declined. She is quite pretty/attractive....curvy with a slight amount of beef. I like her.

Massage was good....with a bit of TT later in the piece.....on the flip she allowed touching all over.....in fact, I think she had an orgasm not long before me.....during last 15 minutes she gave me a hot foot-bath and a head massage....which was good.

I will see her again some time.

Age : early 40's here on visa with her sister

Size/shape : Petite, average for Chinese, I found her good looking

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : R&T naked, BBBJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Popped in here on a Friday with no appointment about 10.30am. Susan ushered me into a room. I also saw another AMP which I was glad I didn't get as she was 2/10 in looks and body. She has a tight body with C cup breasts. Once she left the room I got changed, leaned on the table when she came back in to give her the message im up for it.

As soon as she returned, she spent the first 15 minutes getting me hard by playing with my tackle after doing a good back massage. The massage was great as well. 

Before the flip, she pulled my hips up in the air and started massaging my cock, ass and balls with oil. She flipped me over and asked what I wanted. I said BBBJ. She said $100 extra and I said no way extra $50.  She hesitated for a while and countered with $70, I accepted and she proceeded to get her boobs out of her bra which I started to suck on and dropped her pants as she had boots on.   I proceed to put two fingers in her pussy and give her clit a workout which she seemed to enjoy.  She didn't have much vacuum but was enjoyable enough.  After 5-10 minutes of sucking and HJ I was getting ready to come.  So I held her head and gave her some encouragement and she took a load in her mouth which was very enjoyable.  Then she says - I am not very good ; I replied I can come back and give you some more practice which she laughed.  She has a good sense of humour and speaks good English.

She was a great punt!

My experience: made appt to see new young Japanese girl suggested by Lily.....when I arrived I was told she would be another 10 mins....BUGGER....so I took Susan.....seen her many times before ....she is very good.

BUT on this occasion she was interrupted 3 times to deal with matters at the front desk....BUGGER.....I decided that I would get dressed and walk if it happened again.

Every cloud has a silver lining....after the flip she administered the best BBBJ I have had in a very long time 

Then she went to get the hot towel and was away for a long time...I was half dressed when she returned.

Caught sight of the new young girl....she looked sexy...but not very buxom.

Age : early 20's 

Size/shape : Petite, pretty, sweet, sexy A/B cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese (Beijing)

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience: Got a chance to see the "new young girl" this week and she did not disappoint.

Nana is very pretty and sexy. English not great. Part 1 = massage was very good....not much TT nor much touching from me....but did get the odd groin push into my elbow.

Part 2: There was not much time after the flip before a HE was offered.....I asked for full naked but she said top off only.....she uses her fairly smallish boobs to maximum advantage....a fair bit of licking, nibbling and kissing too. Not to keen on me playing with her fanny, but I made a bit of gentle progress and familiarity on future occasions might pay dividends.

She went to a lot of trouble to make sure I had a happy time (Maybe intro from Mama-san, Lily, helped).

I will return and happy to recommend.

My experience: Rocked up unannounced again this week and was offered Nana again.....she gave me a very competent massage....although she was called away once.....and and sniffled a fair bit which was a bit off-puting.

On the flip she was very sensuous and gave a good happy ending, but nothing that was mind-blowing.

On my was out Gina was behind the desk....had not seen her for quite a while....bought back some pleasant memories.....she was slim and pretty.....unlike last time I saw her (at Kenny's) she looked like she was pregnant, but I think she had some serious medical problem which has now been resolved.....will try her again soon.

My experience/comments: Needed a good strong massage yesterday so I tried to line up Lily 2# (the largish lady who normally worked at Kenny Massage on Northbourne.... Lily the Mamasan said she was away in China/Sydney? and was going back to being a cook when she returns....not an entirely convincing story.....and a pity because she was the best deep-tissue masseuse in Canberra.

Was told to come and see new girl called Vivi (pronounced Wee Wee???).

She was young, fit and pretty. She gave me an above average massage....but not in the same league as Lily 2#

Just before the flip she started some intensive TT which was nice.....we then negotiated what I thought was a naked RNT.....but she kept her heavily padded bra and skimpy panties on. She allowed some limited touch but I could not understand what she was saying so I backed-off a fair bit.

H.E. was very well administered.

Would be willing to see her again, but will try a few others first (I am enjoying punting in Sydney much more than Canberra at present)

My experience: took a punt and walked up the stairs....saw Gina (and Mona)....decided to try Gina....who has been away for a long time....I think she had some fairly serious health problem, but looks fit now.

Massage was very good....in fact, better than most.....increasing TT after 30 minutes led to an early flip and a very good HE.....she is competent and pretty.....encouraged some touching upstairs and actively discouraged anything else. After HE she gave me more massage and I fell asleep...I left happy!!!

Gina has good english and is a wealth of information....among other things, she mentioned that Michelle (with the sandpaper hands) has returned and is now working on Mondays and Tuesdays....Note to self, I must try her again soon

My experience/comments: Got messed around at City Walk Massage so walked over to Oasis and took a punt.....did not think much of the one on the desk, so asked who else was there....out comes Michelle.....who I had seen a few months ago at Dickson Massage.....but seems she is back here full time.

Last time I saw her I gave here a largish tip after the end....she danced around and hugged and kissed me with much glee....Message to self: give tip before massage...it might make a difference.

Into the room...hand over largish tip and she starts hugging etc ...I then lay on the table and got one of the best deep tissue massages I have had in a long time.

On the flip I have imagined a BBBJ or some other special service....but alas I got a very sensual naked HE with lots of touching but no cigar 

I think she is great, despite he limited english....will see her again for sure.

Person's Name : Sara(?)

Establishment : Oasis Massage 

Date of Visit : December 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Unit 1/19 Garema Place, Canberra City

Phone : (02) 6152 0952

Hours of Business : 10:00 - 21:00, 7 days

Rates : $80/hr + $30 tip

Age : mid-20s

Size/shape : 6-8, 5’3”, petite

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Not really

My experience/comments : I rocked up without a booking and Gina was at reception. She summoned a youngish girl, sporting the long straight shiny hair that I am especially fond of, whom I had not seen before and sounded like she might’ve been called Sara. I was shown to a vacant room and left to disrobe.

Sara gave a (very) firm massage, unfortunately relying quite heavily on her forearms and did not check how I liked it until I emitted an audible grunt of discomfort. She eased up slightly but in the latter stages didn’t hesitate to use her feet on my back. It wasn’t my favourite style of massage but I appreciated the effort at providing a proper therapeutic massage. Unfortunately, there was no sensual component built in at all.

However, after asking if I wanted to extend for another half-hour (no thanks), the second part was a bit mechanical and she was quite particular about where she allowed touching (external only, of course). Sara failed to lay the groundwork for the grand finale and had to work at generating arousal. She wasn’t too keen at me trying anything different either, like sitting up, for too long. She seemed to have an SOP and was determined to stick to it. Anyway, I got there in the end but can’t say I was particularly satisfied.

Unlike a Wei Wei (sp?) I saw there once a few months ago, at least Sara didn’t try and charge me $50 for this mediocre level of service. The younger ones may be more visually appealing but I generally find the MILF types like Mona are usually more enthusiastic and fun.

Hours of Business : 10:00-21:00 7 days 

Rates : $80/hr + $30 tip

Age : late 30s / early 40s

Size/shape : size 10, 5’4”, C cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : I took advantage of the post-New Year lull, when Canberra gives its best impression of a ghost town (where all the ghosts have chucked a sickie), to visit Oasis since there were no gawkers lurking at the cafes out the front. There was a petite MILF type with dyed red hair in shorts and a tight top at reception and she beamed at me and ushered me to a room. I hadn’t seen her before but she looked promising. Just as I began to take off my shirt, Sara (see review above) came in, her face buried in a phone. I asked if the other lady was free which seemed to shock her: I wanted to see the older bird instead of her?! I guess it must’ve been her turn, but she recovered and didn’t seem too put out, yelling at the MILF and returning to her phone on the way back to whence she came. She didn’t seem to recognise me from last month either. 

The smiling MILF seemed pleased I had requested her, presumably unaware my previous suboptimal experience with Sara was why she was there (otherwise I would not have switched!). She would later give me a card with KT on it so that’s what I’ll call her. After starting the massage, she asked if it was OK — a small gesture I always appreciate and usually indicative of the quality to come — and I confirmed it was to my liking. KT took on board my request for a soft/medium relaxation massage and avoided the heavy duty stuff. I think it suited her as well because I suspected she may have just finished with another client shortly before my arrival and I had not let her rest. 

There were little hints of sensuality here and there when KT did my legs, though nothing too obvious. Eventually her touch transitioned from massage to caress and I waited in eager anticipation for the main event. She offered NHJ for $50 but I didn’t have the extra cash so we agreed on the usual $30. To my surprise, she removed her shorts anyway saying it was too hot and I was nice (um, ok), but kept her top on. 

KT was happy for me to caress her thighs and bottom over her skimpy panties while she gave a very competent HJ. We canoodled a bit, me being careful not to overstep any boundaries down below, and she seemed to like the attention my lips paid to her neck. I ended up standing while she stroked me to completion over the table (I don’t think there was a disposable cover, just a light towel). KT cleaned up the evidence and came back to finish the session with a relaxing head massage. 

On my way out, she gave me a card with her name/initials on it and seemed keen for me to visit again. I probably will, just have to pick a day when the gawker count is low again.

On this occasion she was happy to see me and commenced a really good firm massage....after a while it became a bit more erotic and I realised that she had removed most of her kit and was rubbing her breasts up and down my body.

After the flip we rolled around and generally enjoyed erotic body slides and plenty of touching.....in fact, it was so good, I might see her again soon.

But nothing much has changed....she is pretty, she is sexy and she is a competent masseuse.

On the flip I sat up and hoped to help her disrobe, but her bra was like a Chinese puzzle.....and she said it was the wrong time of the month to play downstairs. This is irritating when you find it out very late it the piece....and many times it is bullshit.....in fact I once had "four hand massage where both girls claim the same!!!).....anyway Nana administered a very good HE and allowed me to slide hand under her bra.....I left happy.

I would see her again but doubt that her routine will change.

My experience/comments: After walking into the place in City Walk, Canberra...and finding a fairly average looking lady behind the desk with very limited communication skills, I decided to bail and walked over to Oasis, about 80 metres away.

KT was at the desk and she greeted me warmly.....massage was great and almost naked HE followed.....I enjoyed every bit of it except for two things: she took a phone call mid way through the massage (which put me off a bit) and she promised a BJ when I come along next time, which made me wonder why not this time.

Overall very friendly and I would see her again

Guys, just curious whether anyone has attended this establishment for a rub? Stuck my head in the door one afternoon, it had a couple of women who had just had a massage and were paying their bill at the front desk and claiming medical benefits. So I assumed its a legit place, offering no "extras". 
Any first hand "sorry about that" knowledge would be appreciated.

Value for money/recommend? : Indeed, there is great potential here.

My experience/comments : So I was given a voucher to use for an hour's massage at Foot&Thai Belconnen, hence the question earlier as to whether or not this place provided RnT.  Rather than waste the voucher, I booked myself a massage, and researched the place heavily.  There was one website (word of mouth online) that had 6 reviews, the latest of which (Mar 2013) said that most of the ladies will provide something extra.  So, I decided to play it like an RnT with the lovely lady I was provided, and TOFTT at the same time.

I walked in and mentioned I had a booking, then sat on the couch in reception until I was called in.  While I was waiting, a number of others came in for their massage, and it seems as though at least 5 women in addition to Lynette the receptionist were working.  Met finally came out and ushered me into the first room on the left - it had a sliding door with no lock, pity...  It was just big enough for a large massage table, giving about half a metres space to walk around the table.  She asked if I was going to use the sauna afterwards, to which I responded "yes".  She then asked me to remove my top and pants (this was my first warning sign that she may not provide what I was after).  She left, and I stripped off what she asked, leaving me naked - who wears boxers on a punt?  I looked around the room, found the little side table that contained a very used box of tissues, and thought things were looking up.

She knocked on the door to ask if I was ready, so grunted in affirmation once I was on the table.  She made no comment to my being naked, but put a sheet over my bottom half and handed me a disposable pair of underpants and asked me to wear them (second warning sign).  I did as she asked, and she then placed the sheet over my whole body, followed by a little face washer over my head.  She switched off the lamp in the room and what proceeded was a brilliant massage of my whole body, in the style I remember from when I was in Thailand, and great strong pressure as I asked.  She started on my back, then my neck, then each of my legs, then back to my back and neck before I was asked to turn over.  During this I mentioned how soft her hands were, and how great the massage was, she wasn't much of a talker though. Each time she worked on a new area, she moved the sheet away, and tucked it into the underpants.  She did, however, make it feel like she was caressing my arse each time that happened, and she pulled them at least three quarters the way down when she was working on my back.

Once on my back, I was given the chance to move my arms about, and made a few motions to caress her legs.  I gave it a go three times, and each time she moved away from my touch (this was the point when I figured I would just have to lay back and enjoy the amazing massage she was providing).  By this time, I had created a tent in the sheet that was fairly visible - those disposable undies are quite stretchy! She finished massaging my arms, and had another go on the neck.  After this she asked if I was interested in a face massage.  This sounded nice, so I replied "yes", but also thought to use this opportunity, as one last feeble attempt, and directly asked if she provided any extras.  She replied "no", but it didn't sound like she was being very forceful about it.  I said "that's a shame :P" and she said she had to go wash her hands, and left the room.  I got all excited that it might happen, that she could be asking someone else about my request, but then got scared she might be reporting me for my question.  Once she returned, it was obvious all she had done was wash her hands.  The face massage was very different to the rest of the massage, much more light and sensual, and created the tent once more.  I swear I heard her giggle at this point....  but nothing came of it.  Oh well.

I had a wonderful massage, and it was definitely worth the $80 I spent.  Would I return?  See, it just seems to me that I didn't get the right lady.  I love a good massage as much as I love a good RnT and the end, it just so happened that there wasn't one provided this time, but I bet that should I return, I may have better luck! From the way she reacted, it's even possible that the girl I had could be corrupted into giving a little 'extra' on the side.  All in all, a punt is a punt, and this time I fell short - still a great time though

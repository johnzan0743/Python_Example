My experience/comments :.

Having previously lived around the area and did a lot of shopping around Cooleman Court, I had spotted this massage shop but never gave it much thought.  I had some business to attend to around the area so I thought I would give them a try.

Phoned up and spoke to a mature sounding Thai lady called Wan who was a bit pushy for me to make an appointment. She quoted $65 per hour for a full body Thai oil massage.  I asked her if I could be in the nude or do they require me to wear underpants to which she replied "discuss when you are here" so that sounded promising.

I rolled up just during the lunch period and noticed a fair bit of foot traffic passing by, the front door / window is not curtained or tinted so it is fairly exposed to the foot traffic.  I was met at the counter by Wan, she looked late 40's early 50's, is tanned, chubby about 168cm tall.  Wan gave me a short grilling about where I was from etc etc. A younger but equally chubby girl popped her head around the corner and led me to the first of the six massage rooms.  My room was right at the front, with the large window facing the footpath, whilst it had a light curtain and some more patch curtains applied, it did not dim the brightness coming in nor the shadows of people walking by.  The massage room walls did not quite reach the ceiling either.

I stripped off and was nude under the towel when Ploy entered the room again. I was slightly disappointed as I was looking forward to a massage from Wan, whilst she was older looking, she had a knowing look in her eyes.  Ploy covered my back and legs with the towel and lent her considerable weight into elbowing my back before I gasped out for a relaxing massage only haha. She immediately eased off, removed the towel and applied heaps of oil onto my back and massaged my back and butt with lots of little tickles on my sack.  

I asked Ploy about her experience as a masseuse, how old was she, how many rooms were there etc.  She replied she was 25yo, had a total of 13 years massage, 10 in Thailand and 3 in Australia and this massage shop had 6 rooms. That would imply she was 12yo when she started massaging which didn't sound right.  Wan called out something in Thai which Ploy translated as "Are you interested in opening a massage shop?"  LOL  Wan then said something else in Thai whcih Ploy translated to ask if I wanted a 4 hands massage.  Turns out Wan is her Mum!  It was a tempting offer but both ladies did not do anything for me and I declined.  It would have cost $130.

After massaging my balls lightly and stroking my shaft (little ABC was not rising to the occasion) Ploy whispered in my ear would I like a HE.  I asked how much and she replied $200 (not sure if that was for a HJ only or in total for massage and HJ either way I wasn't paying that.)  We then went through an extended negotiation period before finally settling on $100 for massage / HE but massage for 45 mins only which was fine by me as I have had much better massages than this.

After finishing off on the back of my body I was asked to turn over where Ploy massaged my chest and arms before removing the towel and lightly fondling little ABC and then asking me to pay up - WTF!  I got her to pass me my wallet and paid her but this broke whatever lustful thoughts little ABC was working up to and he went back to sleep. Ploy then commenced a pretty mechanical HJ with little ABC stubbornly refusing to wake up - I think it was the lack of ambiance of the room, brightly lit, shadows of people walking by, a towel blocking the hole where the air cond was, crappy music and a lack of connection with the ML.  Little ABC finally spurted, Ploy after wiping me down with a warm towel, then gave me a pretty good face / head massage before advising massage finished.  I still had a fair bit of oil on my body but decided not to shower (shower facilities were available) and dressed to go.  

Ploy did have a green tea waiting for me when I left the room which was a nice touch but WIR - probably not unless I was in the area again and only to give Wan a go.

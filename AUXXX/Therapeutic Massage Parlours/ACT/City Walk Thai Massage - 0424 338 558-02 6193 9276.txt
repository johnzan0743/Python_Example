Hey all, 

I TOFTT on this one, 

City Walk Thai Massage,

purely legit, small joint, both ladies on the day are in their 50s, and not attractive by any measurement. Even extras were offered, I wouldn't have entertained.

Anyway, if you are after extras, not this one.

Happy to write a review using the template, but not sure if there is any point.

Person's Name : Wi

Establishment : City Walk Thai Massage

Date of Visit : 12 January 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0424 338 558

Hours of Business : 9.00-6.00

Rates : $95 ph for very serious deep tissue massage...less for other varieties of massage

Age : 45

Size/shape : Average...nice personality but looks are nothing special

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : 1hr deep tissue massage

Value for money/recommend? : Yes for massage....doubtful that other services are available

My experience/comments : Suffering from sore back on a Saturday arvo and not really in need go HE, I decided to take one for the team and try a new place.

Made a phone booking and turned up. My expectation was that HE would be available, simply because of its location (halfway between two notorious RNT massage places in Garema Place and City Walk!).

Met by Mamasan, who is no oil painting, and she commenced a fairly reasonable massage....she had asked me to leave my undies on, but I took them off as I always do and rarely have a problem.

After about 20 minutes there was a change of lady and Wi took over......what followed was the best/most intense deep tissue massage that I have ever had = brilliant. But no suggestion of any HE being available....i didn't ask or hint and neither did Wi.

I will return and find out for sure some time soon

With your mentioning of a $70 massage, what did they offer? I'm just confused - would that lower end package necessitate or prompt the ML to offer extras?

Just a quick one. Went today to see if things have changed and to TOFTT if necessary. Went up the stairs and asked what was on offer. The receptionist straight out said to me: "massage only - if want extra go to shop top of TAB". Wow. 

If they know what goes on there, how much longer before Oasis gets raided, a-la Chok Dee/Pink Girls style?

On the way out I did notice a sign for a new Thai massage place near Shogun Japanese restaurant. May have a look to TOFTT on that one too.

that Thai massage has been there for a few months, legit only, though $59 for a good 1 hour legit massage is VFM.

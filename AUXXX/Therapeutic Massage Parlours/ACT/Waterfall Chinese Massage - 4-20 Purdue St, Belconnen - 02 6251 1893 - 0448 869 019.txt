My experience/comments :

I decided to give this shop a try, another one part of the Oasis chain, however they have decided to call it WCM.  I went during business hours and it is located within a courtyard of businesses.  Most have tinted windows, so I suspect all eyes are upon you as you walk into the courtyard and then up to the not so subtle signage of the shop’s entrance.

 Lily (Mamasan of Oasis CBD) was behind the counter and greeted me enthusiastically with “long time no see my friend”.  Well sort of true, I have been avoiding the rather open entrance of the CBD shop of late, usually only venturing in on days where the conditions have forced all the coffee drinkers from loitering around the outside hahahaha.  I haven’t seen Lily at the counter the last few visits.   I checked with Lily who was on duty today and was told Michelle (with hands that feel like sandpaper ) or new girl Lisa.  I chose Lisa and was advised there was a 10 minute wait, so Lily accompanied me into the room for a catch-up chat whilst I undressed and assumed the position on the table.  The shop is quite nicely fitted out, I think I saw 3 rooms (not 100% soundproof) and there is a toilet inside the shop as well.  The rooms are of an adequate size, pretty  sparsely fitted out but quite warm on this cold day.

 Soon there was a knock on the door and Lisa entered.  She has a very pretty face with thickly applied lipstick on.  Medium build with enough curves to be interesting and dressed in some sort of massage uniform with long silky pants.  Unfortunately, her English was not very good and my Mandarin even worse so conversation was almost non existent except for me providing feedback when asked about the pressure etc.

 Lisa gave a pretty good massage, I had asked for a soft relaxing massage but I can feel the strength in her fingers and have no doubt she can deliver a hard therapeutic massage if asked.  There was increasing TT leading up to the flip and she didn’t mind me lightly fondling her legs and butt.  On the flip, after massaging around my upper thighs, I chose the NHJ option for a reasonable $50 (unlike recent sessions at the Oasis branches where the PYT’s seem to be demanding rather outrageous prices for the same service and where the “N” does not mean full Nude either!).  Lisa gave a pretty good unrushed HJ, didn’t mind some breast play (has nice perky breasts with long responsive nipples BTW) and developed the coup de grace by sucking sensuously on my nipple whilst giving the final few strokes.  I mentioned about her thick lipstick, because that lipstick was around my nipple when we finished and proved hard to clean off entirely whilst in the shop and I managed to only get it off in the shower hahahaha.

Well, I was quite happy with the shop’s fit-out, just felt I was very exposed whilst walking in during business hours.  I have checked the place out after hours and it is much quieter with not many of the businesses open.  The Oasis girls are rotated through the 3 different locations so it might pay to check who is on roster before attending.

Tried today. English was an issue and the lady had no idea what she was doing. Lucky another punter can even in and took the hit. Walked away. Maybe I’ll try again later.

My experience/comments :

I had been meaning to visit this place for a while and finally had the opportunity on a Sunday afternoon. I had driven past the place earlier in the week and baulked how busy the ‘court’ they were in was – many watching eyes, but perfect for a weekend punt being out of the way and very quiet.

Rocked up without a booking and was greeted by a good looking middle aged lady called CiCi. She was dressed nicely with just enough cleavage showing to know what was on offer.

Into the room for a pretty good medium pressure massage hitting all the right spots. Annoyingly though, she left the room every time the phone rand or someone entered the reception – I hate it when they do this, especially when you can here another lady in the premises. Anyway, back to the massage which continued very nicely with just the right amount of tackle play and reach through. 

Time to turn over and I was as hard as a rock. I always find it hilarious that, when they have been playing with your cock and balls for the last ten minutes with obvious results when turned over, they feel compelled to ask if you want a happy ending.

Needless to say, the answer was in the affirmative and off she went, starting with some nice slow stroking, balls rubbing and anus play. At a point shortly after CiCi it seemed that CiCi felt compelled to get the job finished ASAP and all eroticism was out the window by increasing the tug to 100mph. Although after some pointed instructions she understood and went back the ‘slow and sensual’

Shot a decent load shortly after and was pretty happy with the session.

Would I return? Yes, but not in a hurry based on the talent Oasis in Phillip currently has.

My experience/comments :

I haven’t visited for a while and received an SMS answering a question I had asked months ago (the question was already answered by my initial visit anyway).  I took the opportunity to ask who was on roster and advised Yuki and Michelle (of “hands of sandpaper” fame lol).  I made the appointment for the next day to see Yuki.

I had to walk past the Physiotherapy business on my way through the courtyard and the two men waiting inside for their appointments looked sharply at me and I have no doubt observed me walking into WFM – probably wishing they were following my footsteps instead of being where they were.    Met Yuki at the counter, she was the only one in for the moment as Michelle was starting a bit later. She asked how I knew about her and I said she was recommended by friends (but she looked vaguely familiar).  As described in the Oasis Phillip review, she has a largish build, but has a young and attractive face and was wearing a short massage style dress which showed off her voluptuous curves. Turns out through our conversation that I did get a massage by her about 1.5 years ago in JMM (Phillip)  when she was known as May and gave me a fairly crap massage and overcharged me for the extras with quite a few restrictions thrown in as well. 

Yuki left me in the room to undress and returned to find me in the “flying Superman” position on the table.  She checked with me what sort of massage I wanted and giggled slightly when I said “Soft and sensual”.  What a difference a year and a half has made, her massage was now very relaxing and sensual and in answer to my question, she said she has had training by the various Massage shop owners.  Very subtle TT was going on and whilst she did not actually grab little ABC, she was adept at keeping him interested.  After the wipe down and flip, she only offered two options – CHJ and NHJ at standard RnT prices.  I went with the NHJ option and Yuki listed her restrictions again – no licking or sucking on her erogenous zones, external only touching allowed.  She has a nice lasered pussy but I mainly focussed on caressing her boobs and curvy butt whilst she delivered an unrushed and sensual HJ along with some dirty talk which got me over the line.  At one point during the HJ, she took a query and booking over the phone, speaking business like over the phone whilst slowly stroking little ABC which was titillating for me knowing the caller had no idea what Yuki was doing whilst she was talking to him .

Finished up and did the walk of shame to the car, conscious I was probably being viewed by all the business hiding behind the tinted windows. If it wasn’t so exposed, I would be over more regularly as this business is quite close to home.

Yuki currently works Mon, Wed, Thur & Fri at WFM and I presume weekends at Oasis Phillip.

Massage was one of the best I have had in Canberra (I like "hard").

After hot towels and a flip she turned on a fabulous HE....without crossing any of her lines.....she is a serious MILF but I am not sure that she will go that extra mile of BBBJ etc.

I like her and I will see her again.....Waterfall as a venue is good too.

My experience/comments : Dropped in for a punt, hoping to jag Yuki again....but Lisa was in foyer and ready to go....she is an excellent masseuse and gave me a very good firm massage for about 35 minutes. She has an interesting technique where she walks round and round the table, massaging the who body at once; with lots of oil.....minor irritation was that the phone rang several times and took a while for someone to answer it (thankfully, not Lisa).

A bit of tackle tickle peceeded a back wash with hot towels.

On the flip she disrobed and administered a surprisingly erotic HE....not roo rushed and showing signs of lots of experience.  I didn't notice at the time, but she never removed her sneakers!!

Yes I would see her again, but would prefer Yuki at this shop.

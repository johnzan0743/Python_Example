This is a new place in Belconnen, just around the corner from Back and Foot. It fronts onto the street and you're relatively visible ducking in the front door.

I made a recce recently to see if there might be a new joint with happy endings in Belconnen.

Through the door there's a bright clean reception area with seating. Being short on time I asked the youngish Thai man behind the counter about a 45 minute massage, and he told me Emma would be available in 5 minutes.

I sat down and browsed their massage menu... Traditional Thai, Thai Oil, Hot Oil, Traditional Thai Reflexology, Deep Tissue, Aromatherapy Oil, Swedish. Each one has a page of description and and every page includes the statement "Strictly therapeutic massage only". There is a sign out the front of the place though that says "All kinds of massage" - maybe we don't have the same list. Maybe we do.

Emma comes out and shows me through a door to a corridor of several treatment rooms, all with lockable frosted glass doors. She is pretty and slim. I can believe she's Thai but doesn't look like most Thai girls I've encountered and I know jack shit about Thai ethnic groups.  Maybe 5'3 and 6B.

She's barefoot and wearing a patterned silk top and pants outfit, which could be a uniform but I didn't see any other therapists to know. On the way out, I noticed it had an elastic waist. Heck, that would be easy access. 

The room itself has a wide solid table and some shelves. It's clean and fresh and some of the signs are good. Tissues check. Dimmer check. Groan-concealing music check. Door lock check.

I nude up and lie down. I'm not sure how this will go so I mostly cover my ass with the spare towel left on the massage table. Emma comes back and turns the towel lengthwise, making no comment on my nudity or any particular attempt to look away.

I had opted for the hot oil massage of course, and she brought in a small jug of oil and placed it on a little electric warmer on the shelves. Nice touch. The oil started warm and stayed that way for the whole massage. 

Emma started by climbing onto the table and squatting on my legs. She moved up my body, pushing her knees and elbows into me, not skipping my ass. Surprising effective, and quite erotic.

Then she got started with the oil on my upper back, first peeling the towel back to expose the cheeks of my arse. Very thorough massage, deep and strong. She moved onto my legs, draping the tool to cover the leg she wasn't working on, but completely exposing the other leg and butt check.

Again, thorough and deep massage of each leg, including quite a bit of probing inner thigh work, possibly extended when I wriggled in response. She massaged near my balls, but only near. 

She held the towel up as a modesty screen while I turned over, and did the fronts of my legs and chest without ever closely approaching the main event, which had gone back to sleep and wasn't drawing attention to himself anyway.

She popped a towel over my forehead and did some head massage, and then to finish off she had me sit up while she knelt on the table behind me and did some final whacking of my back. And that was that except for an offer of tea or water, which she brought when I was back out front. 

While I was paying, there was another woman looking after the front desk. I asked about Emma's availability and was told "she works every day"

Overall, a good massage but no satisfaction. I think this place has potential, but I was too rushed and too cautious to pursue it properly on this first visit. I'm going back to see what happens when I'm more upfront about my interests.

Thanks for TOFTT Blued.

Nice review.

If anyone else is willing to do so, there's also a Thai massage in Tuggeranong Square where the street signs say 'Therapeutic massage only'.

A venue in a busy shopping square only a few blocks away from the local police station.

One wonders if they do protest too much. None of the truly therapeutic-only therapists I have seen felt the need to spell that out. Or maybe that's just wishful thinking.

Drove past yesterday and noticed sign outside saying, massage $69. I wonder if that is a hint of what's available on the inside

Hi guys 

Long time off the airwaves but have been going here frequently as the massage is very good.

It is not the place that i usually go but enjoyable none the less...

I have one lady that i see and massage is good almost to the point of a teeze

Again enjoyable for what it is and at 69 for the hour i certainly cant complain

I hold out hope as the massage gets better 

Glad to be here as its a total change to Melbourne  

Enjoy

Magz

Value for money/recommend? :

Lamenting the (temporary) loss of Kai Lin I decided to shop around and spend some of my hard earned tax return on research. Had this place on my radar for a few weeks now and so seeing there was no review, I decided to TOFTT.

The reception area was small - only a few seats, and reeked of legitimacy. I had my hopes up when I saw the receptionist in a scantily clad tight top which showed ample cleavage... hoping that the rest looked like that.

Unfortunately it was obvious that it was not to be. A purely legit (but good) massage was on the cards. Went for the Thai option and was told to keep the underwear on. Big indication of nothing doing. Saw the box of tissues and thought there was hope but alas not to be. Even tried the 'I don't want to get oil on my daks so can I remove them' trick but was then tersely told that no daks = no massage.

So there you go. Apparently legit massage place only. Oh well.

My experience/comments : This place sprung up in the past few weeks...walked past it a few times; Finally decided to take one for the team. Had a sore back so I booked for 90 minutes....was sorry almost immediately......the place is very small and crowded....and lots of noise from the passing crowd, crying kids etc.....4 or 5 small cubicles separated by curtains.

It was apparent from the moment that I entered the cubicle, there was zero chance of HE or anything else of a sexual nature.....even with total discretion and silence the application of a HE would be obvious to all.....my chances fell well below zero when a man walked in and commenced my massage!!!

What else can I say....he gave me a better-than-average legit massage.....and I paid and left.

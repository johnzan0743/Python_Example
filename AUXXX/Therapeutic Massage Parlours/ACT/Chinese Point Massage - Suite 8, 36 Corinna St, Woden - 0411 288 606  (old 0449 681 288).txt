You'll have to imagine all the emoji in the message, they didn't paste nicely. And I stupidly deleted the message without saving the number. Doh!

My guess is this is an offshoot of  Back and Foot in Belconnen.

Anyone know anything more before I make a special trip to collect my free drink?

Post Content: 
Person's Name : Katie

Establishment : No name and I didn't ask

Date of Visit : This week

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Suit 8, First Floor, Corinna Chambers, 36 Corinna St, Philip ACT 

Hours of Business : 9 to 9 Mon to Sat

Rates : $50 for 30min, sorry, didn't get the 45 and 60 rates but I assume same as Belconnen.

Age : Mid 40s I guess

Size/shape : Slim 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Yep subject to summary items

My experience/comments : OK, following intel from Blued, I dropped in to TOFTT.  As per intel this AMP is upstairs sharing the building with various medical type businesses and a number of vacant units - very, very, very quiet - spooky in fact .  I walked in, one girl on, usual "you want massage?"  Obvious answer from me for 30 min.  She then asked how I knew about the place, had I come from Belconnen?  I said a friend who was a Belconnen customer told me about them.  Thanks Blued  true answer too.  I asked her name and Katie then showed me around, 4 rooms with 3 small and one larger, no other customers or staff, no shower or waiting room.  Katie offered me the choice of rooms so went for the larger one.  

Shop looks newly fitted out, clean and bright   Into the room and I quietly ask about extras while holding a pineapple.  Katie seems a little flustered and says $20 for HJ.  I give her a $20 (she didn't want the $50 - I suspect no change) and Katie leaves me to get undressed.  I noted the table covered with a disposable paper cover 

Katie knocks on the door to come back and asks what sort of massage?  So I ask for medium and sensual, big smile from Katie and we are off.  Katie's massage was pretty good just the right pressure - small amount of scentless baby oil - with plenty of reach through TT and crack attention.  Katie seemed very concerned I was enjoying the massage, checking regularly that it was OK.  During conversation, Katie did mention the "shop is hers" and commented that it was much better than Belconnen.  I guess this went on for about 15 min then Katie went to get warm water and cloth to clean up.  Clean up, back dried with towel then turn over.  Katie now went straight into the tug with the other hand looking after other erogenous areas - pretty good really 

Pretty thorough clean up with warm water and cloth then left to my own devices to get dressed and find my way back to the entrance foyer. There was another girl (younger and plumper than Katie) sitting behind the desk when I came out.  I asked Katie for a business card but they are still coming from Belconnen .   At this point I left to return to the big wide world 30 min after I walked in.  

In summary:


1. Good parking being just over the road from the shopping centre.
2. No obvious means of separating incoming/outgoing punters.  That is to say, the 4 treatment rooms all open straight into the entrance foyer.
3. Good service but clothes off not available - I guess the same as Belconnen. 
4. Standard pricing.

WIR? perhaps, item 2 above is a little concerning

For that price you might as well go to somewhere like Chok Dee. Least it's $60/30 for a nude RnT.

My experience/comments : Thought I would drop in for a second visit as a quality control check on my previous review.  

Katie was the only girl there and showed me into the larger rear room again.  She recognised me and seemed very pleased I had come back for seconds - very touchy/feely this time.

Shop fitout has been improved with some screens to assist with separating incoming (pardon the pun)/outgoing punters

Into the room and I give Katie 50 + 20 and received a  big smile and a kiss on the cheek.  Leaves me to get undressed and knocks to come back in. Katie's massage was very nice, more sensual than last time, very, very smooth.  There was plenty of reach through TT and crack attention, again very smooth and sensual. As before Katie seemed very concerned I was enjoying the massage, checking regularly that it was OK. I noticed this time Katie occasionally stood with her legs either side of my arms that were hanging down either side of the table and rubbed her mound against my shoulders.  Same as last time part 1 went on for about 15 min then Katie asked me to turn over and gave me a very inventive HJ with lots of variety of strokes.  While she was doing this she was gently rubbing either her thigh or mound against my hand.  Very nice indeed.  Clean up with tissues then covered me with a towel and came back with a bowl of warm water and cloth or a good clean up. 

Left to my own devices to get dressed and it was nice that she left the bowl of warm water in the room so I could do a bit more of a clean up if required.  Find my way back to the entrance foyer, thank Katie for the service, receive a hug and kiss in return and out the door.

I might pick my time to return for a 1 hr session with Katie as all the indications are that this might be an excellent experience.

In summary, while nude is not offered, Katie does provide a very sensual and satisfactory service that to me is value for money.

Person's Name : Lissa 
Establishment : Chinese Point Massage
Date of Visit : February 2015
Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Suite 8, 36 Corinna St, Woden - 0411 288 606

Rates : $75 / 45 minutes, plus $20 for HJ ($50 for nude, but YMMV)

I ventured down to Woden one Sunday morning recently to investigate this new establishment. I thought at least I could find out what the shop is called! And in the event, I had a good time. 

Preliminaries
The shop is easy to find, it's inside Corinna Chambers, one of the three buildings of professional/medical office suites along Corinna St, at the back of Woden Plaza. Easy parking is available undercover in Woden Plaza, free for the first 2 hours. You come up the travelator, past the conveniently placed ATMs, out the doors and it's straight across the road.

So far, so good. Except this was Sunday morning and I didn't have a booking. The shop is inside Corinna Chambers, and when I walked up I realised the automatic doors are locked outside of normal business hours. I was starting to feel a little conspicuous, so I retreated back across the road to the shops and called their number. Katie, formerly at Back and Foot in Belconnen, answered. 

The conversation was pretty straightforward, as Katie's English is only averagely bad. I explained I wanted a massage ASAP. She asked if I preferred "young girl or older lady", I said it depends, and she told to come in half an hour when I could have a choice. Although I was on a schedule and didn't really want to wait, I was interested in seeing who was available so I wandered off to kill the half hour in the shops.

As I arrived back, they sent me a text to ask if I was still coming, and then said they'd come down to open the door. (Hmm I thought, that must be the younger option, she has better English.) I walked up, the tinted auto door opened, and there was Lissa smiling in the sunshine.

Oh sweet! Lissa is just my type. She seemed young, early 20s, and looked Chinese Malay to me. She has a pretty face and a compact but buxom body. She's stylish, has long straight hair with brown streaks, and she was wearing skintight black leggings, a form fitting black minidress and wedge heels.  

She gave me a little hug as I walked in, and I had to stop myself from trying to snog her. Woah boy, too fast, this is a massage shop! I followed her into the central atrium of the building, and up the stairs to the shop on the first floor. 

Inside the unremarkable front door there was mamasan Katie sitting behind a desk. She was all smiles, recognising me from Belco. There was no further mention of choosing. Lissa showed me into the first room, just past reception. 

The massage
The shop is newly fitted out. The room was clean, bright, fresh and simple - quite a contrast to the usual primordial twilight at B&F. It had solid walls and a locking door, and the massage table was a solid model with a disposable cover. 

I stripped off and laid down and Lissa shortly rejoined me in the room. She asked how long I wanted and given a delayed start and limited spare time, I opted for a 45 minute session.

Lissa delivered a pretty good massage, with very firm pressure. It wasn't just pushing oil around with her fingers, but a decent variety of techniques, including lots of use of her forearms for instance. When applying oil, she dribbled it all over, rather than rubbing it in her hands, and this was quite stimulating in itself. I also got some brushes of her long hair against my body, which was even more so. 

There was a little tackle tickle during the massage phase, but this was my first session with her and I felt she was holding back from strongly overt erotic moves, as if she wasn't really sure of me at this stage. She left and came back to wipe  off my back with a hot towel.

The main event
I flipped over and Lissa, smiling coyly, asked me if I'd like a happy ending. Of course, I said, and her smile broadened. She told me it was a $20 tip, and then after a pause, offered to nude up for $50 "if you can be quiet".

I thought about that offer for about a millisecond. I am seriously attracted to this girl. I wanted to snog her in the first moments after meeting her. She offers to go nude, what else can I do but agree to the pineapple and say "that would be wonderful".

Lissa emphasised that "Katie mustn't know", and stripped off her form fitting minidress and black leggings to reveal a firm sleek body with a great arse and lovely "nosecone" breasts with long dark nipples. (Her breasts aren't quite as large as you might expect, but isn't that always the way in the land of padded bras.) She has a little roundness to her belly but she's all young and firm, nothing flabby. Her skin is gorgeous, and almost flawless. She obviously shaves her pubes, but it's all stubbly regrowth on this occasion. 

She then proceeded to oil up my cock, and started a charming handjob, before leaning in to rub her breasts against me. Her long hair was getting in the way a bit, and she giggled "I should have tied it back".  I told her it was damn sexy though and she was all smiles.

At some point, she climbed up on the table, and gentle bodysliding her chest against me turned into full on spanish, with her holding her breasts together while I thrust between them. When I came, it was a fountain that splattered her stomach and chest above me. Lots of laughing and smiles from my new friend.

Reflections
Lissa told me this is Katie's shop and independent of Back and Foot. It opened the last week of January. If you're planning to visit, do not even mention the possibility of nude massage girls to the mamasan.

I had a great time with Lissa. She's a pretty young student who can actually speak English. She likes compliments and smiles a lot. She was a charming mix of being experienced but not too experienced. And she has a cute arse.
I'm glad for my bank balance that I don't work in Woden, and that Lissa doesn't work every day.

Oh, and she gave me my "free drink", on the way out - a can of Coke. Warm, but free.

Great review, Blued, and thanks for the details about its precise location and weekend access arrangements.

I am just a bit puzzled about Lissa saying "Katie mustn't know" about the HE, since antares01 reported getting the same holistic therapy from Katie herself, not once but twice.  Are they each doing it on the sly without realising the other one is as well??  Surely not, though that would be hilarious.  Anyway, advice certainly noted by me and shall act dumb (something I excel at) if I do make it there -- had previously considered visiting B&F in Belconnen but, based on various reviews, it doesn't sound like a very good set-up from a privacy perspective.

Given the neighbors; podiatrist, dentist and other medical technician type places, I suspect Katie might be a little concerned about the word getting out about the "T" let alone other extras.

Contact Details/Address : Suit 8, First Floor, Corinna Chambers, 36 Corinna St, Philip ACT  - 0411 288 606

Hours of Business : 9 to 9 7 Days

Rates : $50-30min/$75-45min/$80-60min, plus $20 tip.

Age : Mid 40s I guess

Size/shape : Slim 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : HK

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : I guess so

My experience/comments : Booked a couple of days in advance for a 60 min session with Katie.  In summary - as a follow on from my previous review, with Katie, HJ is the only extra although she is quite happy for touching over her clothing - not really my thing though.

As before, Katie seemed very pleased I had come back for thirds - very touchy/feely again.  I guess regulars are good for business.  Same procedure as previous visits and when Katie returned to the room I asked her to massage all of me this time - front and back ........... alas this was not to be.

First half hour was fantastic, a lovely slow sensual massage with very skilled attention to erogenous areas.  At the half hour point Katie heard the entrance door open - she was the only one there with nobody on the desk and she hadn't locked the door -, stopped the massage and left the room without saying anything.  Almost immediately I heard raised Asian voices, Katie and a male.  This went on for a good 10 minutes, pretty off putting really.  Anyway finally all goes quiet and Katie returns explaining it was her landlord.  Katie seems to now reset her "program" by 15 min and repeats the back massage for 10 min.  From this point on, Katie seemed distracted and did not really have her attention on me.

Finally Katie asks me to flip at about the 45min mark and straight into the HJ same as previous 30 min visits.  So much for the front massage which I was looking forward to.  I asked re touching, no problem, anywhere over clothing, however clothes off not an option.

Same cleanup process as last time and out the door right on 60 min.

A bit disappointing this time with Katie, however, looks like Blued scored the jackpot with Lissa though.  If I have another session with Katie I thing I will stick with 30 min.

Re the raised voices with the landlord.  I see from Blued report they are now working 7 days, perhaps the cash flow isn't quite what they hoped for?

My experience/comments : In the area and also after reading the above reviews decided to check out the place.

Parking was a cinch, into the undercover parking (free for the first two hours) up the travelator keep heading straight and out the entrance and directly across the road was the building.  Being around lunchtime, there were a fair bit of traffic on the ground and first floors so not really spooky at that time LOL.

I had texted earlier asking who was available and was advised that Cindy was available.  I enquired about Katie but was told she was busy.  I was going down the path that Katie may be an older woman but then she may also be more gifted in the sensual massage area  

I was met just inside the door by Cindy and asked to wait in the first room whilst she finished up with her client (who was in the process of dressing).  Katie pops in to have a little chat and asked the usual questions how I knew about the place etc.  Katie said “Lissa” won't be long.  I bit my tongue to avoid replying that I though Cindy was going to give me the massage.

Not long and Cindy pops in to lead me to the larger massage room.  (I hope the sheets were changed from the last guy LOL).  Asked for the half hour massage but Cindy did not ask for the money up front.  I was left to  get undressed and she knocks to come back in. 

I was asked what sort of massage and answered medium / sensual.  Cindy smiled but the massage itself with light baby oil was fairly firm and not at all sensual with only my butt massaged occasionally but my back, neck and legs got a good workout, not any real TT.  Time flew by , I made small talk and asked Cindy whether her name was Cindy or Lissa.  She seemed shocked and asked how I knew her name was Lissa.  I quickly added that Katie had referred to her as Lissa.  She said she use to go by that name at Belconnen Back & Foot but goes by Cindy now.    Was advised that 5 minutes remained and would I like to extend my time.  I asked for  another 15 mins and was a happy ending available.  The usual “yes for a $20 tip”. The massage continued for another few minutes with a few brushes on the upper thighs before Cindy said she will be back shortly to wipe me down with a hot towel.  After this, she asked me to turn over onto my back and proceeded to oil me up and a competent and unrushed handjob followed.  She cleaned me up with another wet towel,  I handed over the money and was left to make my way out.  My free drink was a cup of water at the front door :P

I was impressed with the cleanliness of this massage place and the ease of accessibility and would return again.  Cindy mentioned that people from all the adjoining offices do come in for a massage during the lunch break so that period of time can be quite hectic to get a booking.  I wonder if they also go for the happy ending …

I would return if not to have another massage with Cindy (light touching of her legs and butt was allowed but YMMV) or to experience the delights of Katie.

My experience/comments : I knew I was going to be in the area so made time to drop in and try my luck at CPM.  Woden Plaza's two-hour free undercover parking is great for an unrushed visit, even managed to pick up a couple of things from Coles on the way back. 

It was late afternoon on a weekday and I only saw one other person inside the building before entering CPM: a woman came out of an adjacent premises just as I reached the top of the stairs.  I walked past CPM and her then double-backed to my target when she went into another office.  CPM is right in front of the stairs so you can't miss it.  When I entered, a tall Chinese lady greeted me as I studied the price list (which I already knew by heart thanks to this thread!).  Given the difference between the 45 and 60 minute sessions is only five bucks, and I didn't have any pressing business, the hour for $80 was a no-brainer -- and I didn't plan on getting any change from a couple of pineapples.  I was ushered behind a screen, past a kitchenette and into a tidy little room with a massage table draped with a white disposable cover.

The woman left me to disrobe and placed a towel on a side table.  Feeling pretty confident, I lay on the massage table face down in my birthday suit and two seconds later the lady re-entered.  I belatedly introduced myself and she confirmed my assumption that she was Katie.  She asked whether I wanted 'hard or medium', but I said I just wanted a soft relaxing massage as I was tired and just wanted to relax today (hint #1 deployed).  Katie acknowledged my request and began a nice rubbing, kneading massage with occasional long strokes on my back and shoulders.

For the first 10-15 minutes, there was no funny business and I was happily enjoying the massage.  Then Katie's hands found my cheeks and I became more alert.  There was the briefest of tickles in between but I ensured I expressed my appreciation.  Katie gave a short laugh, went back in and lingered a little longer in my happy place, as we both agreed it felt very nice (hint #2).  Then it was time for my legs to be massaged for a while, which was very welcome as I'd done a bit of walking a little earlier that afternoon.  

Katie returned for a bit more sensual slippin' 'n' slidin' between my cheeks and was now rubbing my perineum and tickling my balls and it felt great!  I decided to seal the deal and enquired if she gave a 'whole body massage' (hint #3).  At first she said yes, then a minute or two later she clarified that she massages the whole body -- indicating my back and legs -- but 'not whole body all over'.  I was thoroughly confused.  Was I going to get a HE or not FFS?    As I lay contemplating this, I heard another woman's footsteps and voice outside the room, and later, a bloke's voice -- I'd assumed we were alone on the premises.

Meanwhile, Katie carried on massaging my back and legs and I was beginning to think I must have said (or not said) something, when she returned to my groin with much greater focus.  I raised my bum and gave her plenty of access to the goodies and she played with them at length.  Then she whispered if I 'wanted extra', I asked how much, expecting and thankfully hearing $20, and agreed to an even $100 for the hour with HE (which is what I had expected based on previous reviews).  I got on my hands and knees and Katie stroked my hardening shaft for a bit, then asked me to turn over and continued her ministrations.  She was happy for me to run my hand over her body and I roamed under her dress, feeling her knickers and bra strap.  

Her HJ technique was fine and quite varied but I wasn't quite getting there, so I asked to stand which she readily agreed, and she jerked me off over the table while pressing on my perineum.  Unfortunately, instead of shooting my load over the cover, she was very keen to catch it in a tissue and stopped wanking me a bit too soon, so that I had to throw in a couple of strokes.  Still, it was a good finish and Katie ducked out to get some hot water to wipe the oil off my back.  I dressed and paid on the way out.  Katie gave me a plastic cup of water and a business card, stressing she is open seven days.  She's got a neat set-up and I would definitely return, either to see Katie again or catch the younger Cindy/Lisa.

Notes: looked at all the reviews and decided to make the journey. Same layout as described as others and both Katie and Lisa were there. Went the latter as I've had Katie when she was working at Belconnen. Off I go with Lisa and once formalities have been exchanged the massage starts. Nothing to write home about I start chatting to her and refer to when she was working at Back and Foot. I make mention of the service she offered previously and she confirmed that the same deal applied here as well. 

15 minutes into it and the flip occurs. Top off and I'm presented with a rather tidy body that was a pleasure to see.  I get to fondle and suck her breasts to which she responded with murmured affectionate sounds. Between mouthfuls I ask rather hopingly whether she would consider offering me a BJ. Unfortunately no BBBJ on offer but she would entertain a CBJ for more money. So that's definitely on offer for the right price. For me it was becoming a bit too expensive for no FS. So I settled for the RnT. Oil up and a vigorous tugging action to which I don't have much stamina to last. I make the necessary announcement and lucky for me I was able to blow on her tits. 

Wipe down and $100 lighter and I feel a tang of being ripped off. Rather a FS session with Jenny rather than what happened here.

Mods, the phone number on the thread is wrong. The correct number is: 0411 288 606.
I called 0449681288 and the woman who answered said she doesn't work there anymore. So probably best to remove it.

Yes, when I was given the business card, Katie underlined the x606 number and made a point of telling me that was the one to call (not the x288 which is also on the card).

Services Provided :.RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : I made an appointment to see Katie after a bit of SMS back and forth.

Parking as usual was easy and getting there early and being the weekend, there wasn't too many people around, although they now have a big sign on the footpath advertising the business, I think because of the other massage joint down the road doing the same.  

I was met just inside the door by Katie, dressed in a short black skirt, nice blouse but full stockings (as I found out later :P) and asked to undress whilst she left the room.

Confirmed with Katie upon her return that I wanted an hour massage with HR. She nodded with a smile so all good there.

I was asked what sort of massage and answered medium / sensual and asked her to concentrate on my upper thighs and butt as I had strained it cleaning some very old tiles (true story lol). Katie started on my shoulders and back with light oil before focussing on the said spots.  I made the mistake of striking up a conversation with her which in turn does not put me in good horny mood.  

After the half way mark, Katie focussed more on my butt and upper thighs with the occasion brushing of my sack.  Very arousing.  I positioned myself a bit more for her to stroke underneath but she didn't seem to take the hint.  Oh well....

With 15 mins to go, I was asked to turn over and Katie oiled me up for the handjob.  As she was stroking me she had her butt facing me so I took the opportunity to slide my hand  up her leg and squeeze her butt.  Unfortunately she had those those one piece stocking pulled up to her waist so no real access there.  She didn't pull away so that was good.  The handjob was nice and slow, unrushed until I blew my load.  Katie left me for a moment before returning with a warm towel to wipe me down.

She also gave me a glass of water at the counter before I left which was much needed.

I will return for another session with Katie!

My experience/comments : Haven't been here for a while so thought I would drop in to see how Katie was going.

Katie was the only girl there, she recognised me and seemed very pleased I had come for a visit.

Shop fit out unchanged.

Into the room and I give Katie 50 + 20 and received the usual big smile. Leaves me to get undressed and knocks to come back in. Katie's massage was very nice, quite sensual and smooth. There was plenty of reach through TT and crack attention, again very smooth and sensual. I reckon Katie has got the 30 min service down to a "T".  She knows her way around the male body and how to stimulate and please.  As previously mentioned, Katie seemed very concerned I was enjoying the massage, checking regularly that it was OK. Katie occasionally stood with her legs up against my body and rubbing her mound against me. After about 15 min Katie asked me to turn over and gave me a really nice smooth HJ with lots of variety of strokes and plenty of crack attention. While she was doing this she was gently rubbing either her mound against my hand and arm. Very nice indeed. Katie wears heavy tights under her dress and while I have let my hands wander on previous visits, you don't get very far, so this time I just let her get on with it.  Clean up with tissues then covered me with a towel and came back with a bowl of warm soapy water and cloth or a good clean up.

Left to my own devices to get dressed and I asked her to leave the bowl of warm water in the room so I could do a bit more of a clean up if required. Find my way back to the entrance foyer, thank Katie for the service, and out the door - elapsed time 40 min so no short cutting on time either.

In summary, while nude is not offered, Katie does provide a very sensual, consistent and satisfactory service that to me is value for money.  While she is no Mata, like Mata she is very consistent.  She told me she works 9 thu 7 during winter but will accept bookings with regulars outside these times with prior arrangement.

My experience/comments : Some business brought me over to Woden and as I hadn't been to CP Massage for a while I thought I would book in to see Katie again.  When I phoned, Katie answered and did offer a couple of other girls but I asked if she could be my masseuse and booked in for an hour.

Parking undercover was easy to find and in no time I was in the Massage Centre.  Katie greeted me warmly and did not ask for money up front.

Katie left me whilst I undressed and came back in a few minutes after I was lying nude, face down on the massage table.  I noticed the disposable sheet covering the massage table appeared to be new and not well used like the similar sheeting used at Back & Foot, Belconnen.

Katie asked what style of massage I wanted today and I asked for soft / sensual.  Katie started a dry massage for a few minutes before commencing with oil.  Did all the usual spots – shoulders, arm, back, butt and legs with the occasional TT and sensual touches around the anal area without actually touching the anus.  I was getting aroused and I am sure Katie noticed as well!  She remembered I had asked for a happy ending last time and asked if I wanted the same. Hell yeah!

On the flip, junior had gone back to sleep which is often the case if I start chatting away and lose focus. After massaging my chest, stomach, legs with the occasional touches of my sack (still sleeping) Katie oiled me up and commenced the HJ. Embarrassingly, I just wasn't responding and commented to Katie on this.  I was prepared to call it a day but being a super trooper she was, she then continued a wide variety of strokes and techniques before I finally got hard and blew my load.   

Katie cleaned me up with the warm towel (I noticed the hand towel used was very clean – tick again), I got dressed had a cup of water as I paid my $100 and made my way back to Woden Shopping Centre.

It was a relaxing and enjoyable hour,  the sheets and towels being fresh and clean topped off the pleasant experience for me  and I would make a return visit!

You beat me to it ABC. Excellent  .  No reviews since my last one in June so I was about to do another one on my visit on earlier this week, just to provide up to date intel although it would have been a virtual copy of my previous one.  Yes Katie is good, very very consistent, skilled in the HJ and always aims to please.

I've visited her a few times in the past six months and have been impressed by her customer-focused attitude.  As well as her RnT technique, of course.  A good reliable local operator.

She has mentioned a couple of times how hard it is to find and keep girls for her shop, and many are not inclined to give hand relief.  Last month, she said she'd just lost a couple recently who returned to PRC after their studies finished.  Whenever I've visited, Katie has been the only one there or available, so can't speak to the quality of her employees.

My experience/comments : 

This shop will have been going for 12 months come the 27th January.

I have been dropping in pretty regularly since it opened and as previously reported, Katie offers a very consistent service that is value for money, providing you are not looking for any extras beyond a HJ.

Dropped in the other day for my first punt of 2016.  Katie was the only one there and what can I say that hasn't been said before? .

Into the room and I give Katie 50 + 20 and received the usual big smile. Leaves me to get undressed and knocks to come back in. Katie's massage was very nice, quite sensual and smooth. There was plenty of reach through TT and crack attention, again very smooth and sensual. Katie really has got the 30 min service down to a "T". She knows her way around the male body and how to stimulate and please. As always Katie checks every so often that you are happy with the massage. I notice of late Katie has not been wearing the thick tights she used to always wear, just thin panties and bare legs under a short dress.  She has been happy for my hand to wonder under her dress (I always ask first) but I haven't pushed it re into her panties.

With respectful prompting Katie has been happy to provide external anal stimulation with the HJ which is nice.  As always she is quite skilled in the HJ department. Clean up with tissues then covered me with a towel and came back with a bowl of warm soapy water and cloth or a good clean up.

Katie always leaves you on your own to get dressed and I usually ask her to leave the bowl of warm water in the room so I can do a bit more of a clean up if required. I have never been short changed for time with Katie, a 30 minute booking quite often sees me out the door at about the 40 to 45 min mark.

I commented to Katie that she was not advertising in the CTimes.  She said most of the inquirers from the CTimes ads were looking for additional extras which she doesn't want to get into as a business.  Katie has previously commented to me that Lisa/Cindy was offering other extras including FS to customers and this had caused trouble for Katie and the shop.  BTW, Lisa/Cindy is now in Sydney doing "sex massage".  I didn't ask where.

Given Katie is now relying on an advertising board out the front and word of mouth, it would be interesting to know what percentage of her business comes from AUXXXR.

In summary, Katie provides a very sensual, consistent and satisfactory service that to me is value for money. She tells me she has 2 girls working for her part time but I have never seen them.  Katie will accept bookings with regulars outside 9 -7 with prior arrangement.

Gee, I visited this place a while ago after reading the reviews on here and have avoided it ever since... I found my experience was the opposite of what you guys have had. I guess i got the new girl that day. No HJ on offer, pretty sloppy massage and i was out pretty much on the 30min mark... 

maybe I should revisit and see if it has changed

My experience/comments : Having recently moved further south than where I was previously, I was on the lookout for a new massage place that the gestapo won't have an issue with, when I heard mention of this place in a comment on this forum, I thought I would check it out. 

Walked in one afternoon and saw Katy in reception, I thought she looked familiar from Back and Foot in belco, same name, but different fashion sense, wearing much more casual clothes and sneakers. 

M.O. is exactly the same as Back and Foot, private rooms, no real secret that a bit more than a back rub is on offer here. Shown into the room, nuded up and lie down on the table. Katy came in, and got to business massaging straight away, little bit of chat, but the rub was actually quite relaxing. Lots of butt touches when she was massaging my back, this continued when she started on my legs, with some near 'misses' of the boys. I rotated my pelvis slightly to allow easier access, she got the hint and started feeling my cock and balls up and offered me a happy ending for $20, to which I readily accepted. Katy left the room to grab some warm water to clean the oil off my back, then it was time for the flip, where she gave a token rub of my belly and thighs, then into the tug. Katy's technique is quite good, nice long slow strokes, mixed with short fast ones, all the while caressing my balls, I did not last very long, and shot my load all over  my belly, my only gripe here is that once I shot, Katy stopped stroking. I suppose I could have asked her to keep going, but felt that would ruin my post shot mood. I did notice that later into the tug, Katy turned her head towards my feet, I think she may have copped some accidental fire sometime in the past! lol

My experience/comments : Found myself wanting someone elses hand to get me off again, and had to do some shopping at Woden, so figured I'd kill 2 birds with one stone and made my way across the street to Chinese Point. As I was nearing the crossing, I thought I saw Katy about 30 metres ahead of me, and also saw someone standing out the front of the building, when Katy went in, she spoke with the man, and he went in with her. By the time I got to the door, it was closed and wouldn't open, I the massage shop is the only business is open here on the weekend. There was a sign on the door saying to call the above number for access, so I rang, and Katy answered saying that she was busy and asked me to come back in half an hour. So I left to do my shopping and returned, rang the number and Katy said she would come and  let me in. Shortly after the man I saw earlier exited and I walked in the open door, meeting Katy halfway up the stairs. Into the same room as last time, I asked if anyone else is here, to which Katy replied that no, only one person on today. I originally asked for an hour massage, Katy agreed, and left me to undress. When she came back, she brought her phone in with a message on the screen that someone had booked for an hours time earlier that day. When she showed me her phone, I saw the name of the person who had made the booking, so for discretions sake, if you book in advance, it might be worth giving a punting name.

As we only had a short time, Katy asked me if she could only massage my back, I was happy enough, as I only came for the ending. She must have got bored because she shortly asked me if she could only massage my legs, to save time. Again I had no issue with this. It didnt seem like long until I was asked to flip,  and the happy ending began. Same technique as last time, this time though, she kept stroking me until I had finished shooting.

On my way out, I saw a man on the phone standing right outside the door, he entered as I left, exactly the same as when I entered about half an our earlier. I'm not convinced this is a good idea on the weekend, as there could be a bit of waiting around out the front, as whoever is inside needs to come down the stairs to let you in. It is however not too bad as the door is setback quite away from the street, so it is difficult to see someone there when you are driving past.

My experience/comments: 

Liaising with Katie via a few text messages found out she was going on holidays 21/4 – 3/5/16 and shop will be closed during this period due to her other girl leaving recently scared off by too many customers going for a grope!

I made the booking for today and as usual was greeted warmly by Katie as I entered her premises. Katie left me whilst I undressed and came back in a few minutes after I was lying nude, face down on the massage table.  As usual, the sheets and décor were very clean and there was relaxing music being piped through the speakers.

Katie asked what style of massage I was after today and I asked for soft / sensual.  Katie started a dry massage for a few minutes before commencing with oil.  Did all the usual spots – shoulders, arm, back, butt and legs with the occasional TT and sensual touches around the crack.  There was a lot of focus on the butt today and I even got a light massage on it with her elbows.  Katie mentioned something about the area being a relaxing area and I laughed and agreed. 

Katie brought in some warm water and a nice clean towel to wipe away the oil before asking me to turnover. Little ABC was half awake and Katie enquired whether I wanted a HE.  Is the Pope Catholic?   She oiled me up and commenced a slow and sensual HJ not the jack hammer style that you sometimes get when the ML wants to finish you off quickly.  I tried to hold on as long as I could but eventually succumbed to her expert ministrations. 

Katie cleaned me up with the warm towel and left me to get dressed.  She had a cup of water waiting for me as I came out which was much appreciated.  I paid my $100 and made my way back to Woden Shopping Centre.

It was a relaxing and enjoyable hour for me and I will return to enjoy another massage and find out about her holidays.

My experience/comments :

Katie is back from holidays

Katie is working on her own at present, having difficulty getting girls to work in her shop.  She advertises in local Chinese language newspaper, apparently a lot of girls don't want to travel the 10min to the Woden shopping centre from the city and those that do are generally hopeless at massage and/or not interested in doing HJ.

Like previous visits, Katie is incredibly consistent.  I generally book her for 1 hour these days so that Katie has time to give me a proper massage.  Booking by SMS work well usually you just need to keep in mind English is Katie's second language and you need to be very clear and explicit with the text.  I have found Katie very reliable with time.

Big smile and hug on arrival and into the room and I give Katie $100. Katie leaves me to get undressed and knocks to come back in. A lovely smooth sensual massage from neck to ankles with lots of attention to bum, inner thighs and TT. I reckon her reach through TT is the best.  At the 30 min mark, Katie asks me to turn over and does the front half including a very nice chest and stomach massage - very sensual.  Usual very competent and unrushed HJ. Clean up with tissues then covered me with a towel and came back with a bowl of warm soapy water and cloth for a good clean up.  I sometimes ask Katie before she leaves the room to give my back a second going over once I am standing up.

Katie leaves you on your own to get dressed and I always ask her to leave the bowl of warm water in the room so I can do a bit more of a clean up if required. Katie always gives me the full hour with 1 hour bookings, never rushed.

In summary, for me Katie provides a very sensual, consistent and satisfactory service, both half and one hour bookings.  For those who want extras beyond a HJ, no, she won't do nude, or FS, or BJ, or prostate massage, or any other extra you can think of.

My experience/comments :

Katie sent me a SMS last week - "new lady working today".  Booked a 1 hour session with new lady earlier today.  Arrived a couple of minutes early, Katie met me in reception and showed me into the smaller front room, suspect new lady was with a client.  I offer $ to Katie but she tells me to wait for new lady.  I disrobe and sit on table to wait.  Knock on the door and new lady comes into the room.  I introduce myself and she really struggles to get her working name out - "Julie". 

I reckon Julie would be in her late 50's. Slim and attractive in a grandmotherly way - to me anyway.  Almost no English capability at all, 95% of communication via hand signs.  Julie want's $30 tip for hj so the cost for 1hour + hj is $110.

Julie indicates for me to lie down on table and she starts a very professional therapeutic massage.  I would say she has a fair bit of massage experience.  While the massage was clearly therapeutic, Julie made no effort to add a sensual or erotic flavor unfortunately.  I spent 40 min face down for a very comprehensive professional massage with no TT other then a couple of accidental touches.

At the 40 min mark, Julie indicated for me to turn over and then covered my middle with a towel.  There was 5 min kneading massage through the towel then Julie took the towel away applied a fair bit of oil to little Ant and surrounding area then with increasing emphasis on the tug massaged my entire groin area.

Usual clean up with tissues followed by wet towel.  Get dressed and out the door at the 70 min mark.

Summary:
Julie appears to be an experienced therapeutic masseuseHer English language skills are almost nonexistentVery good therapeutic massage - $80 for the hour is value for money for the massage.Limited sensual/erotic component.Competent hjWIR for Julie?  Dunno, I will book a session with Katie in the near future to discuss.

Thanks Ant for TOFTT on Judy. I also got the SMS from Katie and have been waiting for the passing of the flu I caught at the moment before giving her a go.  I do like a bit of a sensual touch added into the massage though and may just stick with Katie

My experience/comments: 

Like Antares, got a few messages from Katie asking me to give the new girl a try.  Without letting on that I already knew a bit about Julie, I sent a couple of questions back to Katie, one of them asking about Julie's age.  Katie was coy about her age but I managed to get out of her that Julie was older than her.

Made the appointment and was greeted by Katie who led me to Room 1.  We caught up on some news before Katie left me to nude up.  I was half anticipating a real granny like masseuse complete with grey hair and was relieved when Julie came into the room.  She had jet black page boy style hair (dyed perhaps?), big thick glasses, a loose baggy top and a pair of  modern leather look-a-like black casual pants on that showed off a nice shapely butt - I estimate a size 10.

As an ice breaker I asked Julie her name and she did not understand me at all!  She ended up calling in Katie to translate so I knew we weren't going to have much of a conversation during this session.

The massage commenced with me on my stomach and Julie massaging around my neck and shoulders.  She uses a lot of oil and has a light vibration like  massage technique, not the slow sensual style I am use to.  A lot of little pushes with her fingers etc.  No real TT, although she accidently jabbed into my balls with her fingers whilst massaging my upper thigh LOL.  Julie finishes off each section of her massage by giving that portion of the body some rapid shakes, very unusual!

After wiping the back of my body with a warm towel, she asked me to flip over.  On the flip, she covered my groin with the towel and started off with a good facial massage, followed by an extended chest massage and then the shaking of my thighs on top of the towel.  She made the universal gesture for a HJ to which I readily agreed.  Julie also has a strange HJ technique, where she oils up all around your groin area and then holds little ABC (no stroking) whilst massaging your balls, some brushes against your anus and massaging all around the groin area. I lightly squeezed her ass and met with no objections but she moved away a little when I tried to touch her back above the waistband so it seems she doesn't like any touches to her bare skin, of course YMMV.

After this extended groin play, she finally picked up the pace of her stroking and I shot my load.  To her credit, she kept stroking away until she emptied all that was on offer.  After cleaning me up, Julie surprised by asking me to sit up and she hopped on the massage table and gave me a good shoulder massage too.  We went over the hour so she is not a clock watcher.

I may have to return to see whether her sensual massage improves over time.

My experience/comments :

Booked a 1 hour session with Julie to check on how she was progressing . Arrived a couple of minutes early, Katie met me in reception and showed me into the back room and took my money incl $30 tip for Julie. Katie seems pretty happy, I guess having Julie there on Tuesdays gives her a bit of time out as it were.  BTW, Katie told me Julie just works Tuesday.

On second visit I have changed my estimate of Julie's age to perhaps early 50's. .

Julie comes in with a shy smile and indicates for me to lie down on table and she commenced with a quite professional therapeutic massage initially somewhat similar to last time and to that described by ABC.  Compared to my last visit however, I noticed that while I was on my stomach, she increased the emphasis on inner thighs and bum with some very nice gentle stroking massage.  Still no deliberate TT though.

At the 30 min mark, Julie indicated for me to turn over and started a very nice chest and stomach massage that progressed, with the application of additional oil to little Ant and surrounding area with her signature downward stroking of the area then some rather nice kneading of the pubic bone area while holding little ant .  We then progressed to the tug which was very good.

Usual clean up with tissues followed by wet towel. Get dressed and out the door at the 70 min mark.  As I was leaving Katie was very keen to get my feedback which was all good from me and resulted in a big smile and hug from Katie.

Summary:

    Julie appears to be an experienced therapeutic masseuse
    It is a shame Julie's English language skills are almost nonexistent
    Very good therapeutic massage - $80 for the hour is value for money for the massage.
    improved sensual/erotic component.
    Competent hj
    WIR for Julie? Sure would.  A session with Julie is somewhat different to Katie and it is nice to have the option.  Both are good value in my view.  Just remember there are no extras other than a HJ available here.  If you are looking for more, you need to look elsewhere.

We had already worked out I was the poor guy waiting next in line for my massage lol when Julie went 10 minutes over.

Katie also uses Julie as the HE specialist, so you get the best of both worlds, a nice sensuous massage by Katie finished of with a slow and no rush HE from Julie, it is worth the admission price alone to observe her studying the task in hand intently

My experience/comments: 

After enquiring with Katie was told that Julie is working only on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  I made an appointment to see Julie as I had heard that her relaxation massage had improved.

I was greeted warmly by Katie at the door and ushered into the largest massage room (and my favourite).  I undressed, lay on my stomach in the nude as no towel was on the table.  Julie came in and greeted me warmly, unfortunately her English is almost non existent and my Cantonese / Mandarin even worse hahahaha. 

Julie oiled my neck up and commenced a thorough lymphatic massage which seemed like 10 minutes but probably only about 5 minutes.  She then focused on my back, sloshing a fair amount of oil on there and found one or two knots which she focused her attention on.  From there, she massaged my arms, legs and even gave each of my toes a little massage.  Julie finished off the massage for each part of the body by her traditional vigorous shaking of the said part before finally moving to my butt.  The massaging started off normal, seemingly no TT but there was a slight jabbing on the scrotum, more accidental than deliberate I thought.  Gradually Julie commenced the crack attack, focusing more and more in the area, circling the anal area before lightly touching as well and massaging of the scrotum.  It was very relaxing and stimulating at the same time and Julie spent a fair amount of time on that area.  Upon the flip, she commenced a very slow and un-rushed teasing of little ABC and the surrounding area before I eventually shot my load.   Even after "cumming" she continued milking little ABC and massaging my balls and upper thighs before wiping all the excess oil off with hot towels.

I thought time must be up but Julie gave me a good head and facial massage before getting me to sit up on the table where she commenced a very thorough massage of my back concluding with a bit of light chopping all over my back with the edge of her hand.

It was another enjoyable, relaxing and un-rushed hour by Julie!

My experience/comments :

No reviews of Katy since May so thought it was time to write another one.

I notice on her SMS replies I had the wrong spelling of Katy's name.  I have had a number of sessions with Katy since May but she is just so consistent I haven't written them up.

As per my normal routine I made the booking via SMS the day before, Julie was only working in the afternoon which didn't suit me so booked Katy in the morning.  Given the time of year, made sure I arrived bearing small Christmas presents for both Katy and Julie - much fuss and enthusiasm from Katy. Thank-you SMS from Julie (via Katy) later in the day.  

As always, Katy is incredibly consistent with her massage technique. With the 1 hour booking Katy always gives me a proper massage which is really nice.   A lovely smooth sensual massage from neck to ankles with lots of attention to bum, inner thighs and TT. I reckon her reach through TT is the best. At the 30 min mark, Katy asks me to turn over and does my front half including a very nice slow chest and stomach massage - very sensual. Usual very competent and unrushed HJ. Clean up with tissues then covered me with a towel and came back with a bowl of warm soapy water and cloth for a good clean up. 

During the first half of the massage I asked how Julie was going.  Apparently her English skills are improving.  Seems like she has a marked polarizing effect on punters with some very keen on her and the some others avoiding her like the plague.  If you haven't had a session with Julie, I would encourage you to do so at least once as I really enjoy her "ministrations".

Katy leaves you on your own to get dressed and I always ask her to leave the bowl of warm water in the room so I can do a bit more of a clean up if required. Katie always gives me the full hour with 1 hour bookings, never rushed.

BTW, I asked and Katy advised will be closing the shop down between Christmas and New year.

In summary, for me Katy provides a very sensual, consistent and satisfactory service,

My experience/comments :

Window of opportunity appeared in my calendar so grabbed it and booked a 1 hour session with Julie on Tuesday.

Met by Katy in reception who showed me into the back room and took my money incl $30 tip for Julie. Total damage $110.

Once I have stripped and climbed onto the table, Julie comes in with a shy smile and a hello.  As per previous sessions Julie delivers a strong therapeutic type of massage that is totally comprehensive and reaches every part of your body from ear level to toes, missing nothing in between.  Julie seemed particularly enthusiastic today and I had to moderate her approach a few times to manage the comfort level.  Due to her lack of English this was a little tricky.

At the half time point, Julie indicated for me to turn over and repeated the her comprehensive treatment on my front half with increased attention to little Ant.  Julie applied her signature downward stroking of the pubic area then some rather nice kneading of the pubic bone area while holding little Ant . We then progressed to the tug combined with some anal attention which was very good.  As ABC has previously mentioned, while delivering the HJ Julie bends over and gives close and total attention to the task at hand - if she dropped another 6 inches or so she would be in BJ territory 

Usual clean up with tissues followed by wet towel. Get dressed I noted I had been there 75 min - Julie's time management still seems a little awry, perhaps my Christmas present had something to do with running over time . I hope ABC wasn't kept waiting in the side room again though  As always, a thank-you and hug from Katy on the way out the door.

Summary:

Julie consistently delivers a strong massage that may need moderation depending on your pain threshold
It is a shame Julie's English language skills are almost nonexistent
Very good therapeutic massage - $80 for the hour is value for money for the massage.
Excellent sensual/erotic component.
Competent hj

Person's Name : Katie

Date of Visit : 22 January 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Suite 8, First Floor, Corinna Chambers, 36 Corinna St, Philip ACT - 0411 288 606

Hours of Business : 9 to 7 every day

Rates : $80 for 60min, plus $50 tip for two handjobs.

Age : Probably 40s, but could be 40s, Asian women often look younger than they really are.

Size/shape : Tall, fairly broad, remained clothed but appeared to be small-breasted like most Chinese women.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RnT (happy beginning and happy end)

Value for money/recommend? : Yes; two enjoyable handjobs and a good massage for $130 is not to be sneezed at.

My experience/comments :

This was my second visit to Katie, my first having been made after reading reviews of Chinese Point Massage in another forum which confirmed that Katie did hand relief.  On this occasion, I decided to ask her if she would give me a happy beginning as well as a happy end, something that I had become used to my many years of massages by Charlotte of Northmead (see my review of her in the NSW Private Masseuse section).

I arrived at the appointed time of 4:00 PM on Sunday, was met at the door to the Corinna Buinding by Katie (it is locked on Sundays) and ushered in to her well-appointed studio.  As usual she left me in the massage room to undress.  When she returned, asked her if she would give me hand relief at the beginning of the massage as well as at the end.  She seemed somewhat surprised, but agreed, saying that it would cost me another $20, which I thought quite reasonable. (I might add here that over the years, following my positive experiences with French Charlotte, I have asked a number of masseuses for double hand relief in an hour massage; some assented, either for an extra fee or within the single handjob fee, while others adamantly refused on the basis that it was too much effort for them).

As is my wont, I received the first handjob standing; I always find the physical effects of orgasm, the tightening of the muscles, the slight feeling of faintness, a lot more pronounced when standing than when lying down.  Katie seemed a bit surprised when I asked for this particular modality; it may be something she is not used to, but if so she adapted easily enough, laying some tissues on the massage table for me to ejaculate into (I would not want to sully her tastefully furnished massage room).

The first handjob was marvellous, slow and gentle, probably lasting over five minutes.  During this procedure Katie and I faced each other standing, which I always find adds greater intimacy to the experience.  As I felt my orgasm start to approach, I alerted her and she turned me toward the tissues strategically spread out on the table.  My orgasm was very intense; I felt very light-headed, as if I were about to fall over.  While I leaned on the table getting my breath back, Katie cleaned away the tissues and washed her hands in the bowl of warm soapy water she had brought with her.

I then lay face-down on the table for the back massage to commence.  At first the massage was quite soft, but I asked Katie to make it stronger, particularly on my shoulders, which often get quite tight.  She complied, and began a vigorous massage of my back that was quite therapeutic in the typical Chinese style, thoroughly relaxing the tight muscles.  When she moved down to my buttocks and legs the massage became more sensual, with long sweeping strokes up and down my legs and inner thighs. Then her hands moved down between my buttocks and she massaged my perineum in a delightful way, with plenty of TT.

Now it was time to turn over.  As I settled on my back, Katie said with a bit of a chuckle "You want hand relief again".  I was still feeling a bit drained from my first ejaculation, but I replied "Let's give it a go".  I did not mind paying the additional $20 to have my penis nicely massaged again, even if I did not manage to ejaculate a second time.  So Katie began massaging my chest and stomach and the front of my legs, which lasted about five minutes or so; then she took hold of my penis and embarked on the adventure of handjob number 2.

This time it took me a fair while to reach orgasm, probably more than 10 minutes.  The feeling was very nice, but I could not feel any ejaculatory build-up.  After some time, I felt that I probably would not be able to ejaculate again, and that I was making Katy work too hard, so I said that I probably would not cum.  I expected that, like most masseuses, she would take to opportunity to stop the penis massage, but she just said "Does it still feel nice?", and when I replied that it was, she just kept on going.  What a nice thing to do.  Now I began to feel some slight twinges, indicating that the Limbic region of my brain was starting to fire up, and that I might reach orgasm after all.

I thought that a little bit of psychological assistance would help to get me over the line, so I imagined to myself that the hand massaging my penis actually belonged to the redoubtable and unassailable Valentina of Hornsby.  That did the trick!  I could now definitely feel an orgasm building up, although very slowly.  After a fairly prolonged build-up I ejaculated; Katie gave a delighted cry, "You cum again, you very strong".

After cleaning up, Katie left me lying on the table to recover, which took a few minutes since I was now feeling very drained and light-headed.  Eventually I got up and slowly dressed.  As I got up and dressed, I noticed that the clock showed exactly 5:00, precisely one hour since I had entered the massage room.  Katie was able to time the commencement of the second handjob with great precision!

When I emerged, Katie asked me for $130.  I am not sure how that was put together; since the sign on her desk indicated $80 for the hour massage, and she told me that the second hand relief would be an extra $20, so I assume she charges $30 for the single handjob.  Presumably she charges for successive handjobs on a sliding scale, in much the same way as for the basic massage, ie the charge for one hour is a bit less than double the charge for 30 minutes.

Before I left, I told Katie that in two months' time I will be turning 70.  She was astonished; "You very strong" she said again.  I think that is a Chinese thing, the concept that the sexual functioning of the male body is a manifestation of some sort of universal cosmic energy.

As I was leaving, I asked her if she had any other staff, and she told me  that another lady worked there on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, and sometimes on Fridays.  I presume that is the Julie that has been reviewed on this thread.

I will probably return to this venue to see Julie, but after that, having now seen Katie twice, I most likely would come back a fourth time, unless Julie turns out to be worth another go.  I am cognisant that this is my last hurrah and that old age will soon catch up with me, so I would like try some other options, such as some of the venues and ladies reviewed in this forum, before my reproductive system finally packs it in.

My experience/comments : I've seen Katy a few times in the last few months. Chinese Point is your standard legit-but-not-legit massage place - small private rooms (with locks), full massage tables and nice Chinese music. Seems quite clean. 

Katy started off with a nice relaxation massage, plenty of oil (maybe slightly too much as I walked out feeling particularly slick), then moved on to milking position, which was so good. I was just about to blow when she told me to turn over (lucky because I wouldn't have stopped her). She then massaged my front and slowly made her way to the little fella. She gave a very nice HJ, except for the fact that she stopped stroking very soon after I came - I always feel a bit let down when that happens. 

Clean hot towels and water for clean up always a nice touch, plus she tends to leave you in there with a towel to clean yourself up a bit more if needed. Very enjoyable and pretty reasonable price if you ask me. 

Not sure if she offers any other extras.

 My experience/comments : 

It was midway through a Saturday afternoon, and I was feeling like having a nice relaxing massage. Initially, I was thinking of trying out Kenny Massage in Civic, which I had not been to but had read about on this forum.  However, when I rang the number given on the various reviews there was no answer, so I could not be sure whether or not they were open. Furthermore, I was a bit disturbed by the fact that the most recent reviews showed a marked variation in the stated price for an one-hour massage, suggesting that the place might be a rip-off joint, one that allows its masseuses to charge whatever price they like.

So I decided to go once again to Katy, whom I had seen twice before and whom I knew to be an honest operator.  I rang her and was able to make an appointment for 5:00 that same afternoon.  I arrived just before 5.00, so the automatic door was still operating, and I did not have to ring Katy to come down and let me in, as I had had to do on the two previous occasions.  I went in and straight up the stairs to Katy's suite, the only one that was still open, one of the advantages of having an after-hours appointment.

Corinna Chambers is occupied by medical-type businesses, so Katy's suite has the exterior appearance of a totally legitimate massage practice, as does the well-appointed and very neat interior. I presume she has customers wanting a straight therapeutic massage, as well as the more dubious types such as myself who are wanting a good penis massage, so she follows the procedure of a legitimate massage, ie she ushers you into the massage room, closes  the door and leaves you to undress, then knocks on the door before coming in.  In accordance, with the façade of legitimacy, she does not offer the penis massage; you have to ask for it.

I adopted my usual procedure of standing naked facing the door, so that the first thing the masseuse sees when she walks in is my fully erect penis.  When Katy came in, after knocking, she feigned surprise at seeing my upraised penis, as she had done on my two previous visits, but I knew that that was all part of the façade.

I immediately said that I would like her to massage my penis, and she said that would be an extra $30, the standard price here in Canberra.  I then asked if she would massage my penis twice, once at the very beginning, and then a second time later in the massage.  She told me that would be an extra $40, that is $20 for each handjob, making $120 in total.  How interesting!  It would appear that she has adopted a common business model, whereby if the customer buys more than one item, the price for each item is less than the price of a single purchase.  Very enterprising.

In line with my normal procedure, I stood facing Katy for the first penis massage, which she delivered in a very nice way, with a gentle, enjoyable technique, strongly rubbing my glans. So different from the rough treatment my poor penis had received from the icy Danielle during the last massage before this one.  So good was Katy's technique that it was not very long at all before I started spurting into the pile of tissues that she had laid on the table in preparation for that eventuality.

I then lay face-down on the table, and Katy began a vigorous but gentle massage of my back, buttocks and legs.  At about the halfway mark she got me to turn over, and I asked her to start massaging my penis again straight away, assuming that it would take an extended massage to bring me to orgasm a second time.  However, so good was Katy's penis massage technique that I spurted after only about 10 minutes.  I looked at the clock and saw that I still had 20 minutes left.  I was sorely tempted to ask her to massage my penis for a third time, but I thought that might be pushing it a little, so I just asked her to massage my front.

Finally the hour was up, and Katy wiped me down with a towel.  She left and I dressed.  At her desk I asked if I could pay by credit card, as I wanted to conserve my cash.  She said yes, but she preferred me to make a split payment, $40 cash, and $80 on credit card.  I presume that was for taxation purposes, or as part of maintaining the façade of legitimacy, since her credit card transactions can be checked, and she needs to appear to be charging only the stated base prices.

All in all, it was a very enjoyable hour I spent with Katy, and I have no hesitation in recommending her to others who would t experience a very nice penis massage or two at her hands.

My experience/comments :

No reviews of Katy since April so thought it was time to write another one.

I see Katy is now advertising in Cracker - Chinese Point Massage - Canberra therapeutic massage - cracker.com.au

As per my normal routine I made the booking via SMS the day before, Julie has left to go back to China so Katy is on her own again.  Katy told me there was another younger girl who only worked there briefly after Julie left but she wasn't suited and didn't last.  I never got to see this girl.

Katy is incredibly consistent with her massage technique. I always book 1 hour and Katy makes an effort to give me a proper massage which is really nice. She is quite happy to give a hard massage if that is what you are looking for.  For me, she gives a lovely firm, smooth sensual massage from neck to ankles with lots of attention to bum, inner thighs and TT. I reckon her reach through TT is one of the best 

During the massage we had a long chat about the increasing massage shop competition in the local area - I thought there were 5 but Katy tells me there are now 8 in the local area.  I know 3 of them offer HE, mmmmmmm need to find the time to check out the other 5   I am pretty time poor at present, might have to get my mate ABC onto the task   He is busy working through the entire staff roster at the new place at present, just need to motivate him to chase the other five now 

At the 30 min mark, Katy asks me to turn over and does my front half including a very nice slow chest and stomach massage - very sensual. Usual very competent and unrushed HJ. With her HJ, Katy is never in a rush and is very happy to try different strokes if suggested.  Usual clean up with tissues then covered me with a towel and came back with a bowl of warm soapy water and cloth for a good clean up.

We also had a chat about what to look for in getting a new ML to help out.  Katy was saying a lot of her customers want good massage as well as HE and are quite happy with mature age ML.  Very difficult to find young ML who is good with massage and HE.  I suggested to Katy much better to go mature age MILF 

Katy leaves you on your own to get dressed and I always ask her to leave the bowl of warm water in the room so I can do a bit more of a clean up if required.

In summary, for me Katy provides a very sensual, consistent and satisfactory service.

Having said that, for those who are looking for more, just to be clear, Katy won't do; BJ, FS, topless or nude.  She tells me she is always being pressured by new clients for these services - quite aggressively at times - and it really gets her down.  In the past she tells me she has kicked clients out and refused to see them again over this sort of behavior.  If you are looking for these things then suggest somewhere else would be more suitable.

My experience/comments :

No reviews of Katy since September, my first punt for 2018 so thought it was time to write another one.

Other than her new website, nothing has changed this this review really just confirms Katy is managing to run a steady ship and deliver a very consistent service.

As per my normal routine I made the booking via SMS the day before.

Katy is incredibly consistent with her massage technique. I always book 1 hour and Katy makes an effort to give me a proper massage which is really nice. For me, she gives a lovely firm, smooth sensual massage from neck to ankles with lots of attention to bum, inner thighs and TT.  This time I did notice she was using her forearms a bit more than in the past, perhaps her hands are starting to get a bit sore after a few years of massaging 6-7 days per week.  regardless of this, Katy's reach through TT really is very good indeed, one of the best I reckon 

At the 30 min mark, Katy asks me to turn over and does my front half including a very nice slow chest and stomach massage - very sensual. Usual very competent and unrushed HJ.  Usual clean up with tissues then covered me with a towel and came back with a bowl of warm soapy water and cloth for a good clean up.

As Katy was cleaning up, she told me that hopefully a new girl will be starting soon.  Katy does not have a good record with new ML's so I am not going to hold my breath.

As usual, Katy leaves me on my own to get dressed and I always ask her to leave the bowl of warm water in the room so I can do a bit more of a clean up if required.

In summary, for me Katy provides a very sensual, consistent and satisfactory service.  Just be aware, she doesn't do any extras other then HJ.

My experience/comments :

I visit Katy when I can but given she works on her own and provides a very consistent service I don't write up each visit in AXR as they would be basically the same.  I note no reviews of Katy since my last one in January, so time to write another one to keep operator info current for those who may thinking of visiting for the first time or haven't been for a while.

My normal routine is to make the booking via SMS a couple of days before. As Katy works on her own, this is the best way of ensuring you can get the time you want. Discrete parking available over the road at Westfield shopping centre (2hrs free then $) or nearby ACT TAMS (council) paid parking.

Katy is incredibly consistent with her massage technique. I always book 1 hour and Katy makes an effort to give me a proper massage which is really nice. Interestingly Katy tells me that these days the majority of her clients book one hour sessions with her and she gets quite a few 90 min sessions.  She doesn't like two hour bookings as she gets tired and her back and legs get sore.

Her hand/wrist soreness has settled down so she is back to using her hands more now, however, if you ask for a firm massage Katy will use her forearms a fair bit.  

During these cold months Katy always has the heater turned up and the room nice and toasty   Premises are always neat and clean and Katy uses a full size disposable massage table cover for each client.  For the first half of the session, Katy spends about 20 min on a very nice medium oil massage - she doesn't use heated oil unfortunately. She then starts some gentle TT which moves to full on reach through TT with some crack attention thrown in as well - she is really good at this.  At about the 40 min mark, Katy asks me to turn over and does my front half including a very nice slow chest and stomach massage - very sensual followed by a very competent and unrushed HJ. Usual clean up with tissues then covered me with a towel and came back with a bowl of warm soapy water and cloth for a good clean up.

During my massage we chatted about a number of things including her staffing situation.  I am guessing that despite Katy's expressed desire to have another ML working for her, I suspect she might be quite difficult to work for  and therefor she will most probably remain a solo operator.  Therefore when you visit CPM you can have; Katy or Katy 

As usual, Katy leaves me on my own to get dressed and I always ask her to leave the bowl of warm water in the room so I can do a bit more of a clean up if required.

In summary, for me Katy provides a sensual, consistent and satisfactory service. The flip side of this is lack of variety.  Also as previously mentioned, be aware, she doesn't do any extras other than HJ and tells me she has banned punters who have refused to take no for an answer, try to negotiate a cheaper $ rate or have otherwise behaved badly.

As always YMMV.

My experience/comments: 

Katy messaged me to advise she has a new member of the team, an older lady and would I like to make a booking.  I made the booking and when I turned up it was none other than Susan, formerly of JMM.  😊  Seems like when JMM went up in flames and the future of JMM in doubt, Susan got a job here.  I was pleasantly surprised as Susan was my favourite ML at JMM of recent times.

Was led into the end room and stripped down to lie on the table.  As usual, Katy's premises are arguably the cleanest and warmest of the massage shops around Canberra.  For some reason, I have only just noticed that her tables are relatively narrow compared to some of the other shops but very sturdy and stable.

Susan came in and we had a restricted conversation (due to her English) before she commenced her usual quality massage, a combination of therapeutic and sensual. If you are a regular client of Susan's, she picks up your likes and dislikes and adjusts the massage to suit.  Maybe because I haven't seen her for a while but her TT started quite early and was quite intense such that I had to turn over early for her to administer the HJ.  She doesn't mind external touching but "nothing inside".  Once her skilled HJ had done it's job and I was cleaned up, she continued the massage and I almost dozed off (maybe I did briefly)!

Once time was up, I was cleaned up with the soapy water and towel and left to dress. I tipped Susan the standard fare for a HJ of $30 and paid Katy outside for the massage and bade both farewell until the next time.

I have since heard from Katy that there are two younger girls trying their hand at massage but they seem to work only on the weekends but both are still learning how to massage.  I guess practice makes perfect!

Rates :$80 60mins + tips

Age : Early to mid 20's

Services Provided : Massage + Naked HE 

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Visited Lena on the basis of another positive review and she did not disappoint....she is young, fresh and pretty.

Part 1 was a very good massage (she only does light or medium).....there was a fair bit of conversation.....her English is very good....established that she usually starts at noon on Monday to Thursday....and she comes from the Northwest of China. No touching by me nor TT by her for first 40 minutes.....she then popped the question ($30 for HE and $50 for naked-sort-of HE).... and went off to get some hot water and a towel to remove oil from my back.

Part 2: was very good too. She removed her top to expose very nice c-cups....then pulled tracksuit pants down to her ankles and left panties on. She then applied some oil and administered a very competent HE.....she only allowed touching on the outside of her panties....but watching this pretty young thing at work was adequate compensation.

I will return

My experience/comments :

Katy had mentioned to me on a previous visit she had some new girls working for her in the afternoons and I noticed DB's review so thought I would give one of them a try.  Turned out Lena was available so booked her for 1 hour.

On arrival say hello to Katy first as she escorts me to one of the rooms and collects the massage fee.  I strip off and Lena comes in.  We introduce ourselves and I inquire re extras; $30 HJ and $50 clothes off HJ.  I take the $50 option.  Lena asks me to lay down on my front and commences quite a good relaxation massage.  We have a bit of a chat as she is doing this and I elicit she is a student (no surprise there), learnt massage at a day spa in Sydney and has excellent English.  Now while Lena's massage of my back, legs and neck was very good, it went on for 45 min and was exactly what one would expect to receive at a legit day spa minus the draping - Lena's hands kept well away from bum crack and groin area at all times.

After Lena had cleaned off my back and legs with a hot towel she asked me to turn over.  At this point we had about 10 min remaining on the booking time.  Lena removed her top and bra, track pants pulled down to her knees and panties stayed on, very nice tight body with firm pointy B+ or C cups.  Lena then oiled up her hands and went straight into a HJ.  Little ant was asleep at this point and Lena actually did quite a good job of waking him up.  Once he was fully awake, Lena's HJ technique was actually quite good.

Usual cleanup with tissues then wet towel and Lena left me on my own to get dressed.

Summary:

Lena delivers a nice relaxing massage as far as it goes.
No attempt at a front massage
Nothing erotic about it and very little that was sensual.
Nude = Panties left on.
Really nice tight body and good English
WIR?  Not for Lena, I much prefer Katy's ministrations.

Value for money/recommend? : OK YVMV

My experience/comments : Got a text inviting me to try new young girl.....always find this to be alluring but somewhat hit-and-miss.

Into the room and strip....in comes Violet....she looked good, very young, naive and fuckable.

Massage was reasonably good (6/10)....but no TT whatsoever.

On the flip she asked if I wanted HE.....I asked if this might include the removal of her clothes and some mutual touching......she made it very clear that nothing like this was available at any price.

She then delivered a hand job from about five feet away 

It was a bit of a turn-on watching her doing it, suspecting that she had minimal experience....but I won't be looking for her again....and I am not sure if she survived her first day or not.

My experience/comments : I have visited Katy several times since my first review of CPM nearly 4 years ago. The one word that probably sums up my experience with her is consistent. I know what I’m going to get from Katy: there are no surprises, pleasant or otherwise. She is the Macca’s of ACT RnT imho.

The last couple of times were no different, though I felt a renewed attraction not having seen her for a long while and also because she was refreshed from a recent holiday and actually looked younger. Katy’s massage style predominantly consists of long flowing strokes with minimal use of forearms and elbows, which suits me just fine. She transitions to the sensual stage with increasing brushes and tickles of the tackle, progressing satisfyingly to a full-on reach-through, by which time I have my bum aimed skywards and am moaning like a loon.

After the flip, she focuses on the goodies interspersed with some sensual caresses of my thighs and tummy. Katy doesn’t mind me shifting into a few different positions either to prolong the pleasure and/or to assist with blast-off. She has improved over time in stroking away until the big O has well and truly subsided, rather than letting go too soon as she seemed to do in the early days. Post-clean-up, she usually continues with a cool-down massage of the legs and arms if there’s sufficient time on the clock.

Unfortunately, all good things come to an end and Katy indicated that next year may be her last as a ML, so I will make a point of squeezing in several more visits over the next 12 months.

My experience/comments : A perennial topic of conversation with Katy over the years has been “it’s hard to get good help these days”. She has often complained about her younger staff members who cannot massage properly or who try and overcharge for extras or who refuse to give any extras or who are too busy with their studies or who don’t turn up to work, etc. I had only ever seen one other ML in CPM and that was on my way out after my first massage from Katy.

On my recent visit, Katy ushered me into the better room and asked if I would like to try her latest recruit. I accepted half-heartedly having read Mr Banks’ review, but was nonetheless curious. I suspect she was finishing another booking because Katy began my massage and I heard someone leave the shop, before Violet entered the room and took over. She was quite cute, dressed in T-shirt and jeans, and sounded like her English was very good. Her massage was quite ordinary, starting with a bit too much pressing down over the towel, but I was expecting that.

There was zero TT or any hint of sensuality, so I was slightly taken aback when she asked if I wanted a handjob. I mumbled in the affirmative and was asked to roll over. Violet launched into it straight away without any build-up so it was pretty slow going in the erection stakes. She appeared perplexed at the lack of a suitable reaction from Little Richard and began glancing at the wall clock at frequent intervals. I thought I’d try another position to expedite matters, so got up onto all fours. This seemed to confuse her further and she was bamboozled enough to ask “what do you want me to do?” I sighed inwardly, gently taking her hand and placing it on my low-hanging fruit, and the other on my limp frankfurter. It was like a light bulb flickered on and Violet began stroking and fondling appropriately. This was very effective and pretty soon she had her hands full. 

I decided to chance my hand and disorientate her again, so sat on the side of the table and motioned her to do likewise beside me. She still needed me to guide her hands to the right bits before she resumed her action. I took the opportunity to caress her hair and back, testing what was acceptable and what was off-limits. She seemed indifferent to that but I quickly figured out touching her modest bosom was unwelcome so quickly backed off. Soon though she got me over the line and her technique was surprisingly good given the disappointing start.

Violet is a cutie and being jerked off by her was ultimately satisfying in a dirty-old-man-corrupts-naive-student kinda way, but Katy definitely offers the superior RnT experience at CPM in my view.

My experience/comments :

Time for my January review of Katy at CPM.

Katy has been going 4 years now, I have visited regularly over this time and I have to say she has been incredibly consistent in the service she provides.

My normal routine is to make the booking via SMS. Discrete parking available over the road at Westfield shopping centre (2hrs free then $) or nearby ACT TAMS (council) paid parking.

I always book 1 hour and Katy makes an effort to give me a proper massage which is really nice. 

It was quite a hot day when I visited, however, the building is well air-conditioned and very comfortable.  Premises are always neat and clean and Katy uses a full size disposable massage table cover for each client. For the first half of the session, Katy spends about 20 min on a very nice medium oil massage - she doesn't use heated oil unfortunately. She then starts some gentle TT which moves to full on reach through TT with some crack attention thrown in as well - she is really good at this. At about the 40 min mark, Katy asks me to turn over and does my front half including a very nice slow chest and stomach massage - very sensual followed by a very competent and unrushed HJ. Usual clean up with tissues then covered me with a towel and came back with a bowl of warm soapy water and cloth for a good clean up.  As there was spare time Katy gave me a lovely light massage to finish off.

During my massage we chatted about a number of things including her staffing situation. Katy was very keen for me to visit on the weekend and try Violet.  Katy admitted Violet was inexperienced "but she is getting better every day". Good try Katy  but I remain most skeptical   Lena is still working for her but I have made it quite clear to Katy I am not interested in another session with Lena.  We also discussed her shop.  As Lv mentions above, her lease comes up at the end of this year and Katy tells me she will not be renewing and going into another business (shop in Canberra Centre apparently).

As usual, Katy leaves me on my own to get dressed and I always ask her to leave the bowl of warm water in the room so I can do a bit more of a clean up if required.

In summary, for me Katy provides a sensual, incredibly consistent and satisfactory service. The flip side of this is lack of variety. Also as previously mentioned, be aware, she doesn't do any extras other than HJ and tells me she has banned punters who have refused to take no for an answer, try to negotiate a cheaper $ rate or have otherwise behaved badly.

As always YMMV.

My experience/comments :

No reviews of Katy since my last one in January this year so we are clearly overdue for an update.

From what Katy tells me she will be closing up when her shop lease runs out at the end of this year and perhaps she is starting to get tired or perhaps loosing interest because this session was the first time in over 4 years she has short timed me.

Unlike my usual routine, I booked 1 hour at fairly short notice.  I was then able to start 10 min early and as Katy was free we did so after a bit of texting to set it up. Katy seemed her usual happy self, shop was clean and the heater was running 

Katy's massage followed her usual pattern with a pretty good massage of back an legs leading into some gentle TT which moves to full on reach through TT with some crack attention thrown in as well - she is really good at this. At the half way point, Katy asks me to turn over and does my front half including a very nice slow chest and stomach massage - very sensual followed by a very competent and unrushed HJ. Usual clean up with tissues then covered me with a towel and went out and I heard her dealing with another customer.  It all went quiet and Katy came back with a bowl of warm soapy water and cloth gave me a quick wipe and left me to it saying she had another customer. I finished cleaning myself up and while getting dressed and putting on my watch I saw would be walking out the door at the 45 min point 

I noted when I left the massage room that Katy was absent, I assume in the other room where the door was closed so I let myself out.

I was a little annoyed at Katy for cutting the time short and not saying anything.  I assume the customer was a walk-in because he turned up about 30 min after the original start time for my 1 hour booking.  Oh well, I still got a good massage and HJ from Katy.  if she does it to me again though, I will not be back.

My experience/comments :

No reviews of Katy since my last one in August last year so we are clearly overdue for an update.

I have visited Katy a number of times since my last review.  The short change on time I reported last time has not been repeated so that is OK 

In early January, I contacted Katy in advance and booked my usual 1 hours session.

I wasn't sure if Katy would still be in business but she is.  She tells me her lease has expired and she is now on short term rental - apparently the building owner is not renewing any of the shop leases and is looking to redevelop the site at some stage.  So, her shop could close at any time.

Katy seemed very pleased to see me when I walked through the door.  Lovely hug and kiss then through to the room.  She told me she is fairly quiet and the increasing local competition is noticeable as casual punters are walking when she is refusing BJ and/or FS.  

As always Katy's massage followed her usual pattern with a pretty good massage of back an legs leading into some gentle TT which moves to full on reach through TT with some crack attention thrown in as well - she is really good at this. At the half way point, Katy asks me to turn over and does my front half including a very nice slow chest and stomach massage - very sensual followed by a very competent and unrushed HJ. Katy usually has a giggle when I come and this session was no exception - I find this rather cute  Usual clean up with tissues then covered with a towel while Katy gets the bowl of warm soapy water and cloth. As usual Katy leaves the warm water bowl and cloth so I can give myself an extra wash before getting dressed.  

As I was leaving another lovely hug and kiss from Katy and off I go. 

Summary:
Incredibly consistent service from Katy over the yearsShe is working on her own so if you are looking for nude, BJ or FS, you need to look elsewhereClean tidy premisesConvenient discrete parking over road at Westfield.

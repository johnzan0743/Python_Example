This was much more of a scouting mission than any serious expectation of a HE.

Qi Massage is located in the new building at Belconnen Markets, around the corner from the liquor store. The premises are clean and stylish. Mustard yellow walls and dark glossy wood. 

I walked in at lunchtime and spoke to the woman behind the desk, who turned out to be the owner/manager Cassie (that's her in the front of the photo above). There was no one else around, and she took me straight in for an hour of massage.

The treatment rooms turned out to be compact but not cramped. "Take your clothes off but leave your underwear on" she said, very clearly. Damn! 

When she returned, Cassie started by covering me with a towel and working over my back and legs through it. Then added oil and repeated the process. I was always discretely draped. At some point I flipped over and she did my chest and head. Good massage. Very relaxing. Nothing else.

There a lots of signals that it's not that sort of place. Clean, sophisticated premises with a public entrance. The rooms have doors, but the walls don't go all the way to the ceiling. No tissues in the room. Conservative uniforms (grey silk brocade tunic). Definite instructions to leave my underwear on. A really good therapeutic massage. A loyalty card!

On top of that, Cassie is the owner, she speaks good English, and she never approached the jolly zone. As I was leaving though, I was walking to the reception desk behind her and I could see that the other half of her uniform consisted of yoga pants and bare feet. I have to say she has a seriously hot arse.

The massage was excellent. The chance of extras seems very low, especially from Cassie. There are other girls who work there though, and who can ever tell what individual arrangements might be made. Still seems unlikely.

Nice review Blued. Shame there's not the added allure of a happy ending there. I've also stuck my head inside the door on one visit to the market. There was a beautiful young Chinese  looking lass sitting at the desk at the entrance there. She was smoking hot, not one of the ones in that pic, so there must be a few others there as well. 
I grabbed a menu of prices and honestly thought at the time that the place looked too legit.

Read somewhere this placed has changed ownership a couple years ago, and it went downhill from there. The previous owner was a girl from Taiwan, likely the pretty girl you guys mentioned above.

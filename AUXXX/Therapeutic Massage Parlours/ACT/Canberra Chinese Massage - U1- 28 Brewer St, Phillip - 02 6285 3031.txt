Now I really should be taking one for the team here, but has anyone tried this place?
Canberra Chinese Massage - Massage Therapy - Phillip, ACT - Yellow PagesÂ®
U1/ 28 Brewer St, Phillip ACT 2606

It's just nearby Chinese Point Massage. Went past the other day and saw a yellow sandwich board advertising this shop. Would have gotten a photo, but i couldn't think of an excuse to have the camera out for the misses. Looks like it's on the ground floor, I saw the same branding on the window of the building.

OK lads, paid them a visit but ultimately walked. They look totally legit. but here is a pic for anyone interested in actually sampling.


Very basic half screening. woman at the front dressed like an actual masseuse. + healh fund rebates (which isn't always a bad sign, but usually is in 90% of the cases) Wasn't willing to part with $90 for a 60min massage to find out.

Did pop buy Chinese Point Massage, asked for cindy. no dice, only the 40+ lass. told her i'd come back for an appointment with Cindy.

So CPM/Katy outlasted the local competition with her consistent, quality service. 

Maybe they should have offered extras!

Yup, plenty of competition in the local area including a second shop (I assume legit) opened up in the main shopping center (downstairs)

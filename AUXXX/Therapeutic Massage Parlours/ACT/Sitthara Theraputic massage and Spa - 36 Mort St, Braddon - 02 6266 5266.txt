Gents, saw this place and decided to try- and gauge the chance of extras. Place is in Braddon near where all the hipster folk lurk. 

Unfortunately, no dice. Purely legit. One for the team. 

Was a good massage but as said before, highly unlikely that this place will do the things we folk are after. 

Happy to to provide a legit review but given the content of this forum I can't really see the point.

This place is across the road from a popular micro brewery.

Thank you for taking one for the team Snapper79, I had wondered about this place.

from their website: "Sitthara Therapeutic Massage & Spa offers thoroughly therapeutic massages only. Please don't embarrass yourself by requesting other services."

I dunno, a good RnT is thoroughly therapeutic!

guys, I went this place again last week, purely legit, in fact, there are posters on the door of massage room strictly stated ' don't touch our therapist, don't ask for sex, it is illegal in ACT' blah blah.

I had a good massage from a Thai lady in her 50s, very firm and good massage.

Went back to this place a few times lately, purely for therapeutic reasons. Had massages from a few Sydney based ladies travelling to Canberra for work. They are much more friendly and cheerful, some light touches through the cracks, maybe just maybe.... i will report back ASAP if I get any further.

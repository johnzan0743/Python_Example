My experience/comments : 

Walked past this one, decided to TOFTT since it is offering special 1 hour massage for $59. 
Rocked up with no appointment, paid cash first then ushered a cubicle by Vivian. Vivian is probably in her early to mid 30s, not pretty but not fugly either. All the cubicles are separated by simple curtains. The massage itself was ok, quite basic, medium pressure. Interesting it says Thai massage, but the two girls there on the day both Taiwanese.
The massage was pure legit, Vivian was careful with where her hands go. I didn't bother asking for extras as there is another customer in the cubicle next to mine, it was that close I can hear him snoring. 
This is an interesting joint with potential, but with current setup, I doubt RnT will be on offer, as the cubicles offer very little privacy. Vivian put me into a cubicle next one to another customer, clearly wasn't prepare to offer RnT

WRR? I wouldnt mind paying current discount rate for a legit massage.

Went there again recently, no RnT, but quality massage for $59 per hour, this time with the mid 40s Thai lady. Just thought I share, in case anyone needs a legit massage at great price.

My experience/comments :

I have visited this place a few more times, was mainly just for the awesome VFM massage, still $59 per hours, with discount on every 4th visit. 

I don't know for sure, but Chada could be a ladyboy, I don't know why but I just have the feeling. I never got a RnT nor asked for one, but sometimes she would press my hands against her boobs during the massage, and place her fingers on my nipples when doing stretch. Maybe she is just teasing, interesting to hear anyone else's experience.

All this aside, the massage is great for the price, would prefer the rooms (if you call them rooms) are not just separated by blinds.

My experience/comments : 

Was out to try something new so decided to google Thai Massages in Canberra. For what ever reason I chose Amata Thai Massage in Belconnen. I think the fact that is has a mobile no. listed got me thinking this place was a sole operator. Rang, made a booking very easily. Once I arrived, I was correct with the sole operator guess as Jenny was the only lady in the shop.

The place is very small with only two massage rooms separated by curtains. Interestingly one room had two tables, presumably for couples. I was led to the smaller room and asked to take all clothes off. I asked whether underwear should stay on or come off to which Jenny responded "it's up to you as you need to relax". I took this as a very promising sign and stripped down naked and laid on the table waiting.

The initial massage on my back and shoulders was outstanding with just the right amount of pressure getting me into a very relaxed state. Once the leg massage started there seemed to be a little more than accidental touches with me getting hard very quickly. With more groin massage I just let things flow until it was time to turn over.

Jenny mostly concentrated on my arms and shoulders which again was very nice. Once onto my legs, she put my thigh into a very compromising (open) position with the accidental touches continuing. Once onto my other leg (which is the direction I was hanging) there were many "accidental" touches with fingers and elbows of my cock. When on this side she removed the towel what it seemed a little further exposing my already hard cock. I was about to ask whether extra's were on the table when another punter entered. Jenny briefly left the room and told him to come back in 30 min. By this stage I chickened out and didn't ask for extra's (very poor form, I know - sorry guys). Jenny finished the massage and I was out the door with the other punter waiting at reception. 

I wonder what he got?

Any way a very promising first massage, but I definitely plan to return in the near future to see what, if anything, is on offer.

Happy punting.

My experience/comments : 

Rain was pissing down in Canberra and then remembered the post on this thread. Phoned but rang out, then was called back by a male asking whether I wanted a massage. Mentioned Jenny then got given the nth degree about it.

TOFTT and decided to go on in. Soaking wet and saw two girls - both seemingly unenthused about this. There are three single rooms with very thin curtains separating the cubicles. Quick glance to see what's there - no ubiquitous tissue box. Bad sign. Booked an hour massage and got a light touch, but therapeutic, massage. Like Calloway there was some 'accidental' TT. Nothing special about that.

Onto the flip and unfortunately nothing else. Guess my mojo wasn't working. It could have been because one of the builders came in and started talking about some possible renovations - that could have scared the girl out of any chance in doing anything.

Finished up and decided to go for it. Asked if I came next time whether there was a chance of anything else on offer. Was directly rebutted saying 'we don't do those massages'. Overheard that the owners may be the same as the place on Emu Bank.

Oh well.

My experience/comments : 

Having some business to attend to at the Belconnen Mall today, I thought I would give Jenny a try at Amata Massage.  Making a booking was easy via a few texts. As I entered Amata Massage, I noticed they seemed to have two curtained massage cubicles behind the reception desk and three to the right.  I was met by a fairly tall slightly chubby gal who asked for $69 upfront and was then led to the middle cubicle of the group of three.  I noticed the curtained doorway was quite flimsy and was not entirely closing off the cubicle due to the strong fans going at the time.  I asked if she was Jenny and she said she wasn't, Jenny was massaging another female.  "Please take off your clothes and leave your underpants on."  Oh oh, this was not looking good for any sort of extras.  

I don't mind an occasional "therapeutic massage only" but I prefer to be in the nude than wearing underpants or the disposable ones they sometimes give you.  The cubicles are so narrow it is impossible to not move the side curtains as you move around the side of the bed to undress.  I noticed the side curtains were split down the middle and held with one peg, definitely not too much privacy.  As I bent to place my tray containing my clothes under the massage table, half of my body poked through to the other cubicle (as the peg was missing) and I got the shock of my life to see a dude lying there, seemingly in the nude with just a towel covering his loins, luckily he had his eyes closed.  I would guess there was currently 4 girls working today.

I lay on my tummy and noticed the towel covering the O ring for resting your face on was very sweaty looking and had a strong BO.  I wasn't going to put my face on that and when Amy came in, I asked if it could be changed.  She made a comment she had only set that towel up in the morning but it was in the mid-afternoon when I was there.  Anyway, all good, Amy changed that particular towel and commenced the massage.  I must say, I enjoyed the typical Thai style massage that Amy gave me.  One with a combination of elbows and long flowing strokes.  At one stage, my underpants were pulled off my buttocks to give her access.  There was nothing sensual at all with the massage though and Amy too great care to not even come close to massaging the groin creases whether when I was on my stomach or on my back.

It was a relaxing and enjoyable massage that would have felt better if I was at least in the nude.

With the flimsy curtains and other staff walking around and talking I can't see any extras being offered unless you happen to be the only one in the shop with only one gal working at the time.

Hours of Business : 10:00 – 22:00, 7 days a week

Rates : $69/hr with specials of $60 p/hr occasionally

Value for money/recommend? : Yes for a massage only

Summary:
So I regularly get bombarded by offers from these guys for discount rates. Decided to make a booking again to see if anything has changed. 

Walking into an empty shop and then being assigned the front most curtained booth indicated that I wouldn't be getting any surprises. 

Small Thai girl comes in and tells me to remove all clothing without skipping a beat. Onto the table I go and the massage commences. Pity I was suffering from the back end of a cold so the pressure combined with the oils meant my nose was running like a tap. Frequently as a result I had to ask for a tissue to clear the sinus which resulted in a disjointed session.

Although on the flip there was some TT I believe that it was moreso accidentally occuring rather than a deliberate attempt to get extras 

Definitely legit unless I'm proven wrong. Good for a massage to relax though.

I heard from Jenn a few weeks ago that she was opening a new shop soon but was coy at giving the address as it was still in the process of being fitted out.  Business had me over the Mawson shops and on the way to the car I spotted this shop.  It is in a group of business suites between the two service stations.  There is a coffee shop next door with outdoor seating but no one was around at the time so I popped in quickly.

Lo and behold, Amy (from Dong Fang Massage) was sitting at the desk with a beaming smile of recognition and as I was saying hello, two other youngish ladies appeared to see what the commotion was about.  I sorta regretted that Amy was obviously first cab off the ranks as the other two were quite attractive, the taller of the two had a naughty air about her! 

The shop is quite nicely fitted out inside, there are 3 massage rooms, all seem to be quite roomy and very nicely decorated and more importantly were all very warm and inviting, the massage table in the room I was allocated was also heated. The shorter of the trio seemed to be the Mamasan today and ignored my query whether the relaxation oil massage was $75ph as per sister shop Dong Fang and said it was $80.

I was left alone to strip and relax before Amy came in to give the customary clean up etc.  She gave her usual sensual oil massage, seems to have improved quite a lot from the earlier days and actually gave quite a firm therapeutic almost painful massage to help relieve some knots I had around my shoulder.  Probably because she is quite familiar with me, a fair degree of TT had me aroused for most of the massage and I did my best to return the favour. On the flip, Amy was in her forte, delivering the nude happy ending the way she knows I like. I tipped her accordingly but as usual YMMV.

Amy mentioned she is being rotated between the two shops but didn’t seem to want to give out any info on the other two, maybe some professional rivalry? 

I must return soon to try one of the other two! 

PS : There is a back entrance, although you need the Mamasan to open with her key but I used it to good effect as a bunch of pensioners were having their morning tea next door as I was leaving.

My experience: A friend went here recently and met Coco....he said she was fabulous. I decided to walk in and hope she was there. Unfortunately she was not, so I went with Sarah who was also fabulous.

She is really cute and a great masseuse with passable English.

Great massage for about 40 minutes....followed by very erotic body slide and HE.

I will see her again.....on my way out, saw two or three of the gang from Dong Fang who are a variable lot....I will book next time before I go to make sure I get one of the young and pretty ones.

My experience/comments : I walked in and woke up a young ML with badly dyed blonde hair on the couch at reception. Her face was quite attractive but the phony blonde look just spoiled it for me. She later identified herself as Vivi. Her massage was pretty lame to be blunt: lots of useless pressing down and overuse of the forearms on my back, and no TT or focus on my butt. 

After the flip, by which time I was regretting having gone for my usual hour, she tried to charge me $50 for a plain HE, with clothes off extra. I was in no mood to be extorted so declined, explaining the standard tips I was prepared to pay. Vivi quickly changed her mind and offered me a topless HJ for $50. She initially asked me to cough it up first, but gave up when I firmly assured her I’d pay her afterwards. This was a wise move as I suspect she might not have been as accommodating if I’d paid upfront, since she initially ‘forgot’ to remove her bra. 

Anyway, once the financial unpleasantness was out of the way and we understood each other, Vivi's HJ was quite passable and she even allowed me to kiss her nice firm tits. Although she was not exactly enthusiastic, it was clear she didn't mind my tongue teasing her tits and a stifled moan or two escaped her lips. She had left her pants on and I briefly regretted not holding my ground for the full NHJ, because her butt was firm and very squeezable, and I would've liked to have gone exploring between her legs. Vivi's hot bod and little hand stroking my cock somewhat made up for her disappointing attitude and that unfortunate hair. When I was done, she cleaned me up and gave a brief half-hearted thigh and head massage before calling it quits -- about 10 minutes short of the hour. 

This shop is a borderline proposition for me. The greedy attitude of the younger girls leaves a lot to be desired, and I’ve been put off by the (attempted) rip-offs. Their hygiene and cleanliness standards don’t appear too flash either, with towels not always changed after my session from what I've noticed a couple of times.  Still, I have had an odd good punt here as well so will probably return at some stage eventually.

Thanks for the review. I was considering a visit but had heard some negative feedback - your review just confirmed that.

It has been very hit and miss for me, probably more the latter, though I know others have enjoyed better luck. 

There was a very nice, enthusiastic and youngish MILF type ML I saw the time before Vivi but could not extract a name from her despite repeated attempts, so didn’t bother with a review — and also not possible to book her again without having her shop name. I guess this place is very much a punt depending who you get.

My experience/comments : dropped in here today and asked for the lady I had last year (gi gi). Unfortunately she has returned home to honkers and won't be back. Took a punt on the one I was speaking to at the door, Helen. 
Shown to the cubicle, disrobed, jocks off and onto the table, ready and waiting. 
She returns, commences a pretty hard elbows and all massage. Felt ok tbh, used a bit of tiger balm also. No tackle tickle, so I asked for some hand relief. No way! Not that sort of massage she tells me in broken ingrish!
My previous lady, Gigi, would assist at completion for a "tip" of $20, not so with Helen. She was adamant, not going to touch me anywhere down there. Anyway,maher next words, after she tried the upswell for one hour, we're......finished.
Would I return.......nope.
Bit disappointed and I was quite toey today as well.

Spotted a new ad on Gumtree for a Chinese Massage in Mawson. Her ad may get pulled soon, as it disappeared and I had to inform her that it was missing. Ignore the address on Gumtree, there is no such number for Heard St, Mawson.  I had to phone her when I was in Mawson and it turns out she is in one of the shops within the Mawson Shopping Centre with the Post Office behind her shop.  I forgot to take note of the number of the shop though.  The Mawson shops are quite a busy little shopping centre and there are a lot of sitting areas around the outside of her shop and lots of businesses with large windows too.  

Liaising with Apple to make a booking was quite easy, she responds well to SMS messages. The outside of the shop is your typical Chinese Massage frontage including a neon flashing sign.  (see pics below).

The inside of the shop and the rooms are quite old, from memory use to be an Accountant’s office but I could be wrong as it has been quite a few years since I have been there.  Small reception area with two massage rooms on the side with flimsy sliding doors and walls.  What I don’t like is that when Apple goes out to greet someone, the person standing in the reception area has a good view of you as she opens the door.  Luckily I was on my stomach and still had a towel draped over me.

I asked for a relaxation massage with a little oil and that was what I got.  I didn’t want a hard therapeutic massage this time. As this was a first time for me, I kept my hands to myself, despite Apple leaning heavily at times on my head as she reached through to massage my lower back and butt.  I think because it was my first time there, Apple was also a bit wary.  There was only a slight bit of TT close to turn over time, almost faint enough to be accidental but it did happen enough times that I felt sure it was deliberate. 

On the flip, I had a semi erection and noticed Apple looking at it with a slight grin on her face, so that made it easy to ask if she does a HJ (still testing the waters) and she nodded in the affirmative so off we went.  She oiled little ABC up and initially started a bit to fast and hard to my liking but after slowing her down, she gave a pretty good HJ that got me over the line.
After the clean up with hot towels, I paid for the massage and tipped Apple $30 which she seemed quite happy with.  She thanked me again for giving her some business.  I believe she has only been there for a few weeks.

In summary, I really enjoyed Anna's massage and would definitely return, although I feel it would be a bit uncomfortable if both rooms were occupied at the same time as I feel sure one can hear everything that is going on due to the thin walls.  Luckily, Apple is currently working by herself atm.

Just having a another read  of my review, I meant to add there is another massage room across the other side of the reception which contains a massage mat on the floor.  The massuese's name is Apple not Anna as I somehow mistyped in my last paragraph.

My experience/comments :

Based upon ABC's experience, I thought I have better pay a visit.  Dropped in without a booking and Apple was the only ML there.  As per ABC's intel, 3 rooms, 2 with tables and one with mattress on floor.  Apple showed me through to the rearmost room with a table.  Once in the room, I paid Apple for the hour ($80) and she left me to get undressed.  No hooks so clothes have to go into the clothes basket.  This room appears to be a bit of a storeroom with some shelves filled with spare towels, timers, cupping glasses, oils etc.  I noted the table did not have a full size disposable cover, only small face and middle section tissues, as I was the first punter for the day and the towels appeared fresh I made no comment.

I also noted the walls appeared to have an extension added and went right to the ceiling, the Gumtree photos show the wall stopping well short of the ceiling.  I also noted nil aircon/heating vents and a pedestal fan so I suspect in the afternoon on a hot day the two rooms on the Northern side could become quite unpleasant - even without any clothes on.

I was sitting on the table when Apple returned, she gave me my change and we sorted out names.  I wasn't asked re type of massage and there was no attempt at draping except when Apple had to go out to reception for a visitor.  Apple started an oil massage on back, bum and legs which was pretty good.  After a while I raised the issue of extras and Apple offered HJ for $30 which I agreed to.  She wanted the $ up front and as I had the notes ready on top of my clothes this was no problem.
From this point the TT increased and I have to say, Apple is very good at a teasing reach through TT combined with other massage strokes and some bum attention.  At about the half way point someone came through the front door and Apple threw a red blanket over my middle section and went out into reception, leaving the door half open.  After a bit she closed the door and there was with a lengthy murmured discussion before she came back in - suspect this was second punter for the day being talked into waiting.  A bit more massage and excellent TT then roll over for front massage.  Apple was in no rush and gave me an excellent front massage with increasing attention to little Ant culminating an a very good HJ.  After a cleanup with tissues and wet towels there was about 15 min left and Apple gave me a very nice head, shoulder and face massage to finish with.

Apple left me on my own to get dressed and came out to say goodby when I left.  This last bit was interesting as she came out from the room equipped with the mattress, left the door half open to reveal a face down punter with his mid section covered by a red blanket.

I liked Apple and she did an excellent massage and HJ.  Up there with Katy at CPM. CPM is a much nicer shop though.

Summary
New shop in a quiet part of the Mawson shops with excellent parking.Premises other than table were clean enough however very cheap fit-out and you are exposed when ML opens door to meet another punter in reception as she is only staff member.No sign of aircon vents in rooms.Apple has reasonable EnglishNot short changed on time despite back to back jobsCheap Woolworths baby oilI was concerned re lack of full cover on table, possibly a deal breaker for me.Good massage and HJWIR?  Possibly but may have to insist on changing towels on table.

I haven't been to this shop for a while as there are many other shops to try and I am not that impressed with the privacy inside and outside.  The Thai take away next door has been replaced by I think a Deli and they have tables outside for their customers.  I was lucky the morning I went there that the smoke haze has kept people indoors.  Lucy, who I had met in another MS had messaged me to say she is now working here and to come and try.  

I noticed they have tried to make the rooms more private, have upgraded the curtains in every room. I went into the room with the mattress and noticed thick heavy drapes which is a marked improvement from the flimsy curtains they had before, where you could still see the shadows of people walking by.  I could still hear the shop next door though when things were put down heavily on the counters etc.

Lucy left me to undress and came back in to find me in the standard position.  As usual, she gave an excellent and relaxing oil massage, tends to use her elbows on some parts but not too painful so all good. As we approach the time for the flip she started some TT with some reach through before wiping me clean with some warm towels and asked me to turn over. Negotiated a nude HE and helped Lucy out of her clothes. She has a nicely filled bra and I am always a bit wary of what I would see once she removes it (padded bras abound ) but Lucy does have nice breasts with cherry sized nipples. I spend a bit of time playing with them and sucking on them whilst she made little noises of appreciation. Those nipples fill my mouth nicely!  A light bit of pussy play on her tight, thinly covered pussy before she gets down to the main event and I eventually blow.

After the clean-up and settling of the tip, I spotted Apple on my way out  so she is still around.

Not sure if I would hurry back as the front of the shop is exposed to the coffee drinkers next door but Lucy is worth a repeat visit or three.

It should be noted that the current rates for this shop are $65 / 60 mins, and $100 / 90 mins.

They also have a loyalty card, after 5 massages get 30 mins for free.

My experience/comments : Following a booking miscommunication at another shop in the vicinity, and against my better judgment due to the previously reported subpar hygiene (and the glaring typo in the business card above), I decided to try MCM finally given the hourly rate had dropped on par with Sydney shops (thanks to ABC for the tip).

I think I woke up Apple in the room on the left of the entrance, as she got up sleepily to greet me. Unfortunately, I ended up in there on the mattress because the rooms with a table (my preference) were occupied. I should've sussed that out before handing over the $65 and probably would've walked in that case. The room was hot and stuffy which made me regret this punt already.

Before she got started, there was a lot of faffing about with the A/C, and after she eventually got it going, the massage was crap: never like being pressed down upon when lying on a mattress. I was also very dubious about the hygiene situation, especially since she seemed to have been sleeping on the mattress when I arrived and didn't seem to change the towel when I left.  

After the flip, Apple tried to extort $50 upfront for a clothed HJ (wanted more for NHJ), but when I held my ground she settled for $40 to be paid on completion, which I was OK with since the massage rate was lower than anywhere else in Canberra. The finish ended up being OK, with Apple licking my nipples to help me over the line, so I was not too dissatisfied when I left, but definitely won't be rushing back given there are better options available.

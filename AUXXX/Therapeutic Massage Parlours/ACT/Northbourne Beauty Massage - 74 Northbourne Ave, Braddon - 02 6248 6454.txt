Person's Name:Chic???

Establishment: Thai Odyssey Massage

Date of Visit:March 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: Phone 0450 707 011, FB page: https://www.facebook.com/thaiodysseymassage/

Hours of Business: SMS 

Rates: $70 per hour

Age: Mid 20s?

Size/shape:160cm, busty for a Thai girl

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai I assume

Services Provided: Massage only

Value for money/recommend?: Great value for a good 1 hour massage.

My experience/comments:

Saw this joint on FB, no reviews here so far, thought TOFTT. For those of you familiar with the ACT RnT scene, this place is next to the famous Kenny's message, basically on the ground floor of Medina self service apartment.

On arrival greeted by Chic, she is the same girl with lots of photos on their FB page. Escorted to the room next to their reception desk, eccccckkkk... followed by a pretty good oil massage, not as good as Thai Bliss near ANU, but very close.

my usual style, here is a list of my takes:

1. I found Chic very attractive, sweet and cute face, busty and meaty which is rare for Asian girls. Her English is very good, as she worked in WA for 5 years before moved to Canberra. I found her better looking in person with light make-up compare to her FB photos
2. I didn't get any extras nor had I asked since it was first visit. I can never be 100% sure, but with my extensive experience with legit Thai massage, I have a very strong feeling it might be on offer, here is why: I was asked to take off all my clothes, Chic wore a nice silk robe was damn sexy and provocative. During the session, there were a few accidental light brushes to the area, and she does this stretch of my legs, basically lift my legs with my balls and little brother hang in the air. On the flip, she didn't cover my eyes and face like Thai massage usually do, I was able to look at her face and body, again I found her damn hot and busty.  
3. She mentioned to me, she got a colleague who is a beautician. I saw an older lady at the desk when paying, must be the beautician she mentioned.
4. My only concern is the room is damn small, basically 2 meters away from the reception desk and waiting area and the door is not complete sealed at the bottom, maybe RnT is not on offer, Chic just giving us hope for more business 

I am calling the Mario brothers - ABC_bonker and Antaras to test the water!

Thanks for TOFTT  BK, I have found it pretty rare getting a HE from a Thai massage shop in Canberra  

BTW, this shop doesn't meet the prerequisite for a Mario Bros review as it appears to have only one ML

Services Provided : Massage only for Nik, but...

Value for money/recommend?

After reading the above I decided to see what the fuss was. Went for the one hour massage and everything is above board. Trying to get note information about what else is on offer, Nik mentions that the other girl will basically do anything the punter wants, for the right price of course. Nik sounds like the mamasan for sure!

Probing further, it’s apparent that Nik will only do legit massage but will turn a blind eye if other girls dog full service. Bit strange that as a boss she’s acts that way, but each to their own. Guess she can claim plausible deniability should she get raided. 

So, will book another massage with the right girl and to see what’s on offer is next on the agenda

Nik’s Massage is good for a legit one, and I may even come back just for that. But definitely intrigued as to what else is offered by others.

Hours of Business : 10-10?

Rates : 45 mins for $65 + tips

Age : 30+?

Size/shape : Shortish and a little bit plump buy quite pleasant looks

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : 

Value for money/recommend? : Marginal

My experience/comments : Finally go got a HE at this place....dropped in on spec this arvo and saw Nicky (mamasan who does massage only). Saw Natalie lurking in the foyer....she looked quite good so I requested her (I think she only works Tuesday and Friday arvo).....

She gave me quite a reasonable oil massage with some very tentative tackle tickle and spoke OK English....on the flip she asked the question in a sort of garbled way. ....and she gave a reasonably sensuous lead-up.....got me over the line quite competently.....but she applied it from well outside of my reach....so it was a bit mechanical.

Doubt that I will chase her again, but who knows what else may be on offer if you book on other days

Apparently Chic has never actually started Thai Odyssey at the Northbourne Ave site, she was just helping out whilst concentrating on establishing her business by starting off with outcalls etc.  She has moved back to WA now and has set up the following website:-

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: Phone 0450 707 011, FB page: https://www.facebook.com/thaiodysseymassage/

Hours of Business: SMS 

Rates: $70 per hour

Age: Probably late 30’s

Size/shape: 5’6 B’s

Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai

Services Provided: Massage & extras but YMMV

Value for money/recommend?: There’s value for a good 1 hour massage.

My experience/comments: 

Nik now messages me when she has new girls in and Rose is one of them. Went for the ho R massage and it was all normal for the first 30 mins. The massage was pretty good and got some knots out of my shoulder in which it frequently causes me grief. 

Onto the legs and then it got interesting. Plenty of TT led me to the conclusion that there was more on offer. Onto the flip and me in full view she lays down what’s on offer. $50 for topless HJ which I accep. Off the clothes go and the bra hides a decent set of B cups. A little bit of oil onto mini me but wait.. there’s more! She examines me closely, sniffs, then takes me in her mouth. Jackpot!

She keeps going whilst my hands wonder down south and find a moist mound. My fingers down there find the bean and I have a play. Me with FIV finger-banging her whilst she’s gulping my shaft. 

Before I long I sense the wave and I let her know. I finish shortly and get the obligatory head and scalp massage after she cleans her hands. 

Good to be on Nik’s call list. Hope this gem isn’t ruined.

Size/shape : Size 4 athletic build

Nationality or Ethnicity : Malaysian 

Services Provided : Massage and extras

Value for money/recommend? No

As previously mentioned, Nik doesn't offer extras but turns a blind eye to her other stablemates offering, even condoning it. Karen is another example of this. Walking in and conduct the business transaction everything goes smoothly. However good the massage was, once the menu was mentioned my appetite diminished significantly. It appears that the younger you are the more extravagant the prices you can think to charge.

$50 for the handy; $50 to touch, and most stupendous- $300 for nude. No thanks. Even the handy was nearly refused given my shock. Deed done and I left soon after. Passing Nik as I left she asked me how it was. Giving her plausible deniability of what happens behind closed doors I mentioned nothing. 

Will I return? Not sure if the prices are still gouge worthy.

Name : Nicky and Amy

Establishment : Northbourne Beauty Massage,Canberra City ACT; AKA Aus/Thai/Massage

Date of Visit : August 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Foyer of Medina Apartments, 74 Northbourne 02 6248 6454 or 0406 834 287

Hours of Business : 09.30am to 9.30pm

Rates : $80 for 1hr Thai oil massage + extras

Age : early 20’s

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai 

Services Provided : Massage and extras

Value for money/recommend? YES

My experience: Almost impossible to find a good Thai massage with HE in Canberra.....and I am a little bit over Chinese at this time. So I decided to take a punt at this place which is reviewed elsewhere in Bronze. Nicky is the Mamasan and she is very friendly and a great Thai masseuse, but she does not do HE or anything like it. BUT she can arrange almost anything you want and seems to have access to many other girls. So the message is, book in advance and you are more likely to get what you want.

The place is clean and tidy.....I have been in two of the rooms; one is a bit pokie; the other is large and well appointed with two massage tables in it.

This time I did not book....just took a punt. When I walked it, Nicky and Pam met me (Pam is a bit of a MILF). Pam led me to the room and I was looking very much forward to her....Stripped off and lay face down on the massage table.....a very good Thai massage commenced which I thought was Pam, but 20 minutes in I realised that it was Nicky !!!....no problem; she asks if I want a HE which I agreed. Soon after she introduces this VERY sweet young Thai lady called Amy and she offered a Handy Shandy for $30 or naked for $50. I agreed to Option 2 and away we went.. She was not overly affectionate nor happy for much fanny contact, but she was very pretty and VERY competent in the HE department....I might book her next time for the full hour and see if there is any more on offer. Might try Pam too.

After Amy departed, Nicky returned and provided the 2nd half of a really great massage.

I think this place has a fair bit more potential than I had previously thought.....especially if you become a frequent flier and get to know Nicky.

I will return.

Rates : $120 for 90 min Thai oil massage + extras

Age : mid 20’s....trim, young smooth with C/D cups.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai 

Services Provided : Massage and extras

Value for money/recommend? YES

My experience: Mamasan, Nicky, is really onto what I like....after a few recent visits. She basically says: :"defer your visit" if there is no-one available to provide a really good massage with extras.

This visit was VERY good.....Annie is very sweet and she does a really good massage with virtually no TT. But she really knows how to turn it on when its time for the flip. Fairly standard $50 for naked HE.....is really great. On this visit there was no rush and plenty of time for reciprocal titivation. In the early stages she got quite excited and this seriously enhanced my pleasure.

Doubt that FS is available, but if you play your cards right, you might score more than just a HE.

I will return.

Seen both Amy and Annie again since last review and had a half massage from Mamasan (Nicky). They are all very good, but Amy is the standout. She works Monday to Thursday. Nicky does massage only (I think?), but she is a great masseuse. Each time I visit, the girls are more relaxed and friendly.

I will probably make this place my Regular for a while....and see how we go.

My experience: Got message from Mamasan, Nicky that she had two new girls staring today....decided I should try one of them.

This lady has a nice face and very good English.....as described above she is big.

Started with a medium massage for about 45 minutes (I prefer a tad harder)....towards the 45 minute mark there was a prolonged period of very soft tackle tickle, which was enjoyable.

On the flip I sat up and helped her to disrobe. What followed was a fairly free flowing roll in the hay with lots of mutual touching and erotic play....and the inevitable happy ending....it was all very good.

On the way out I met the other new girl....much younger and prettier.......I will try her soon.

My experience: Message from Mamasan says she has a new young girl....so I am always keen to explore new pastures.

First impressions are great.....she looks really great. But this is a bit short-lived. The massage is fairly ordinary (A bit of time lightly sealing on my legs and back and then a patch rub-down with oil.....no erotic touches.

On the flip she asked if I wanted extras....but her english is a bit ordinary, so I was not quite sure what I was buying....she wanted money up front.

What I got from there wad her still wearing panties....not touching or kissing and an adequate HE.

She is likely to become more adventurous and improve with more experience.

But I will try others in the meantime.

Massage was fabulous....bordering on deep tissue, which I like.....a LOT of oil and a bit of TT before the flip.

She works Wednesdays and Fridays and has above-average English language skills.

Naked HE with lots of mutual touching was one of the best ever.

I will see her again very soon.

 Anywhere with a legit shop front offering extras?
				
Post Content: 
Hey,

Is there anywhere in the ACT that have a legit shopfront outside of Mitchell and Fyshwick that offers extras in the massage. I've been looking for years! There used to be a place in Mawson that looked the part but it closed ages ago. Just looking for a good massage and an extra...not fussed about CBJ's and FS. 

I heard of a place near the Maccas in Civic but not tried it yet...Review TBC

May at City Walk or Lily (Mamasan) at Oasis.....but all good if you get a good Maseusse....and Bad if you don't....try not to accept someone who does not float your boat.

You mean (the shop formerly known as) Back and Foot in Belconnen. Foot and Thai is as straight as they get, no hanky panky ever reported there.

I think Mr Banks may be pulling our leg a bit after incorrectly pointing out two places that don't pull our third leg ...

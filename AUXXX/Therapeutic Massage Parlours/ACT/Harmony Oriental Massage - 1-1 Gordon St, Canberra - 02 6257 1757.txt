Any one have any intel on Harmony Chinese Massage. 

I was on London Circuit looking for a taxi when a very hot Chinese girl walked past wearing colourful skirt and thigh high stockings with big high heeled shoes. I watched her walk down Gordon st and she walked into Harmony Chinese Massage. I thought gee that looks interesting.

Any one know anything about this place?

Would have except a cab turned up and I had a meeting to go to.

If no one else does the recon, I will leave some time in my diary next time I am in Canberra to check it out.

As an establishment this place does not offer any 'extras'. I think that the likelihood of finding an individual working here that offers something extra on the sly would be no greater, and I suspect far less, than finding someone who will provide extras at any other establishment where such practices are frowned upon.

TOFTT

Since my last post I was back in Canberra and TOFTT. Walk into quite a large single room, well decorated and curtained cubicles - maybe 3. Serious young Chinese lady asked what I wanted and I chose 60 mins $75 for non-oil massage. She says OK take off shoes and take stuff out of pockets and leave on shirt and pants. I think ... wait a minute. SO I ask what about oil. And with that pragmatic Chinese way she says OK $5 extra and take off your clothes.

What followed was a good professional massage with no funny business. I was going to rank her like 7/10 for the massage until the end. And not the happy ending you may be thinking of. After a pretty good massage she ends up giving me an excellent head massage and foot massage and even clips my toe nails as part of it. She then gets me sit on a little stool next to the bed naked with like a sheet over my shoulders and pummels them with her hands which felt so good. So after the head/foot and shoulder ending I am giving her a 9 for the massage.

But as Studley says above no hint of funny business. Other than ... when I came out mamasan was there and she looked like she knew a thing or two. Also there was a stairway (to heaven?) so don't know if upstairs offered anything special. In Canberra it is pretty heavily regulated and a small town so imagine hard to do anything on the sly.

There can be something quite sensual about being massaged by an attractive lady while lying there completely starkers even if there is no funny business going on. I can fully understand that the majority of ladies in a 'legitimate' massage establishment have no desire to to see a client's rod and tackle and hence insist on the use of a towel or sheet to cover the offending area. There is no way that I would want to place a masseuse in a therapeutic establishment in a situation that makes them feel uncomfortable since I would certainly get no satisfaction out of such a session. At the same time, as the paying customer I'm after a particular type of session and if the service provider doesn't provide what I'm after then I thank them for their time and save my money for someone who will provide what I'm after. There are many establishments where I wouldn't even bother asking if this was an option since I know what the answer would be beforehand.

I thought I'd try my luck again and dropped in here the other day and asked for a massage (back and front) and said that I realized that there's was a legitimate establishment and that no 'funny business' went on here but said that I don't like being covered with a towel (which is quite true) and asked if this would be a problem. I was told no that would be fine, so chose to proceed with the massage. While the back was massaged sans towel, when it came time to turn over I was told I would need to be covered for modesty reasons which was something of a disappointment for me. Now I have no problems with this being their standard practice, but what annoyed me greatly was that I was told beforehand after inquiring that this wouldn't be necessary and as such I feel like I was played for a fool. Had they have said, when I asked, that I would need to be covered with a towel (which is their perfect right to demand) then I would have simply thanked them for their time and been on my way.

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

I have been staying in Canberra a bit lately for work. I live in Sydney so this forum has been a good guide for me. I caught a taxi to this place yesterday afternoon. The place can be accessed directly from the street level. Just walk into the front gate to a glass door. I knocked on the door and no one answered so I checked the door handle and it opened. I stood there saying, “Hello” All of a sudden a lady appeared from behind the curtains from the first cubicle right near the entrance. The rest of the place is as described above. No doors just curtains to the cubicles. The lady was whom I later found out to be ‘Alice’ but she was busy with a customer. She called out in Chinese and a younger girl appeared from the last cubicle. She looked okay but didn’t smile and just pointed to the sign on the wall with all of their prices and services. I wasn’t sure whether to walk and wait for Alice or give this young girl a go. To be on the safe side I opted for the 30 min Non-oil option. She looked disappointed but I already knew I had just wasted $40. Into the cubicle and she hands me a washing basket. First time I have seen this. I was told to put my clothes in the basket and remove my shoes. I followed her abrupt instructions and lay on the bench. She placed a sheet over me and basically just dug her elbows in my back, shoulders and legs. I had to tell her to slow down and go softer. 30 mins was up no offer for a HJ and I didn’t want to ask because of her shit attitude. Paid the $40 and asked her how long Alice would be and was told 1 hour. 

I left the place and walked up the hill to the other side of Civic to visit Zhangs Chinese Massage 20 Allara Street. Two better looking girls were standing in the front reception area. I went to walk in and was told they were closing for the day. By now it was 5pm. Not feeling satisfied I walked back up to Northbourne Ave and London Circuit where I saw a Thai massage place near the bus stop. I didn’t want to get mucked around so I just asked, “Hi do you do special body to body massage?” The receptionist said “No sorry” and pointed to a sign that said, “Strictly no sexual services provided” By now I am thinking of giving up as Canberra is not like Sydney where it is easy to get a nude HJ. 

I left this Thai place and walked back down to Harmony Chinese Massage to see if Alice was available. She was and I originally opted for the $80 1 hour option. Once in the cubicle I asked Alice straight away if she could give me and HJ and she gestured with her finger to her mouth to say, “Yes but don’t let the other girl know”. I lay down and she can actually massage quite well. After about 20 mins I gave her the indication and I flipped over. Alice went outside to get a hot towel to remove the oil from my back. I lay back down and removed my undies. Alice commenced an okay HJ. She allowed me to lift up her skirt and remove her undies to her knees. She has a nice bum not flat by any means. I played with her front pubic hair and tried to remove her bra but she had this one piece skirt which didn’t let me lift her top. I think next time she may let the puppies out. They seemed to be an okay size too feeling her bra. I like her face she has sexy eyes and a lot better personality than the younger girl working at the shop. After about ten minutes of me fondling and trying to remove all of her clothes I finally blew a load on my stomach. The usual clean up and I was on my way. I only paid 30 mins. I gave Alice a $40 tip as well and she seemed happy. 

After the massage I walked back up the hill again to Civic near the McDonalds. I walked down the hill into the shopping centre mall area and noticed two more massage shops. 
The first shop was big with a big ‘Massage’ sign on the window. You can see the rooms have doors just past the front reception. Has anyone tried this place?
The second place I noticed was near the bars with another Massage sign. Smaller place but the Asian MILF inside looked okay. I think I will try these places next time and report back.

Hear you bro.

Usually the only places that can be relied on for a body slide or HJ (or more) are private ladies with ads in the local paper, the 'Canberra Times' (aka CT or 'the times') at 70/100 for massage (inc HR maybe more), or the sex parlours  in the local red-light places of Fyshwick and Mitchell. The only place I know of that you can be sure of an erotic experience with DATY, body slide and so on is Chrisindy's at Fyshwick ( http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f113/c...0-7578-a-2899/ ) but the prices are much the same as for FS.

My experience with businesses advertising massage in the shopping areas is (see the Zhang review), strictly therapeutic.

Love your persistence. I live in this dump and still haven't cased the place on foot, let alone gone back to a place where I have already taken one for the team

I take it you mean the 'City Walk' area. A quick search for 'massage business' in that area shows quite a few but they all look pretty straight.

Lifegate, Therapy masters etc.

Ace review Dangar. Thanks big guy.

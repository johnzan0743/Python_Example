Seeing this place on Locanto and in the area, I decided to give this a try. Not having a booking and just as a walk in, I didn't have much hope of getting in. However, just as my luck is I find that two girls are available. Well, one girl definitely and the other looks like a TS post op. Going with the girl 30 min option I walk into the fairly large massage room that has a sink/vanity unit within. I think there's two rooms in total. 

I am then asked to remove all clothing as she leaves the room for privacy - although I hope that all modesty will go within the half hour allocation. Check. No sign of paper undies and and the obligatory 'no sexual services offered' sign printed on A4 paper is visible on the back of the door. 

As she returns I hop onto the toweled table, which still has a heating panel underneath. The massage is typically Thai with kneading and pressing. Light action on the neck, back and shoulders before she moves to my legs... only play massaging the back of my calves before light fingernail strokes to my middle leg. Plenty of TT commences and I respond accordingly. As she asks me to flip I ask what's on offer. As usual money talks and I agree to the HE topless for $50.

As I'm at full mast she playfully teases me with butterfly kisses on my chest right down to mini me. Unexpectedly she puts one of my balls into her mouth and a short session of BJ commences. Balls in mouth, stroking away as my available hands cup and knead the close by breast.

The action quickens and I don't last two long, my 3-day storage launched in a ballistic arc like a protein North Korean missile, onto the sheets. 

Warm towel courtesy of the hot water from the vanity to remove the excess oil and any baby batter that ended up on me. 

Not sure if there are upsells apart from what I got, but the BJ was unexpected and was a bonus. As a first time customer it may have been a sell for repeat business but YMMV.

WIR: not sure about the other 'girl' but may try again for a confirmatory check to get a baseline of what is on offer should I become a regular.

Person's Name : Tina I think

Establishment : Pro Thai, Griffith Shops, ACT (down small alleyway in middle of shops)

Date of Visit : 13 December

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : A's above

Hours of Business : 10-8.00?

Rates : $99 ph for massage

Age : 45

Size/shape : Tidy MILF

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : massage only 

Value for money/recommend? : Recommend only if you want a really great massage with no hint of extras

My experience/comments: Dropped in for a punt yesterday...AND took one for the team.....booked Tina for an hour....she seemed to be the only one available. Shop is really nicely fitted out with large and very private massage rooms.

First bad sign was when she asked me to leave undies on....I took them off as I always do. What followed was a really professional Thai massage, which I enjoyed...then came the flip and still no sign of any sexual touching, so I asked the question and got an immediate message that this was not an option at any price....so I asked if there was anyone else available who could relieve the pressure....she said no way, never.

I will go back and try and book Mai? If I can....but in Sydney with spare time today, so will have a punt there ��

Person's Name : May (unsure of spelling and I wasn't about to ask)

Establishment : Pro Thais Massage

Date of Visit : March 2019

Address: 10A Barker St Griffith, ACT

Weblink : https://www.thaimassagecanberra.com.au/

Phone : (02) 6156 4755 

Hours of Business : 10am to 9pm - 7 days

Rates : Complex price list - see website

Size/shape : tall and slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Oil massage

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : I had some spare time and felt like a nice massage so I thought I try this place with an expectation it would be legit.  I dropped in and made a booking for later in the day.  I arrived a couple of minutes early and May who was behind the counter confirmed my booking and gave me a customer details form to fill out, the form was pretty basic and I "forgot" to fill out most of it. May then took me through to one of the rooms, in this case a large room with 2 massage tables and a sink.  May tells me to take off clothes, leave undies on and lay down on table.  I did as instructed and May returned with coconut oil and a warmer. May covered my lower half with a towel and gave me a pretty good back and neck massage.  We then moved to my legs with the towel was moved to uncover the leg being massaged.  I tried to chat to May but she was clearly not interested in chatting to me so it ended up being a very quiet and restful session.  Once May had finished my legs she walked out of the room and returned with hot wet towels for a wipe down.  

Once the wipe down was complete May held the towel up as a privacy screen while I turned over and she replaced the towel to cover me from mid chest to mid thigh. Both legs were massaged up to mid-thigh then May moved up to do my upper chest, arms and hands then finished off with a nice head massage.  May fetched more hot wet towels for a final wipe down then left me to get dressed.  I was offered tea or water before I left.

Summary
I quite liked the ambience of the shopNicely fitted out and cleanMay is very quiet, I guess she might open up a bit with repeat customersWIR? For a legit massage - Yes.

I went to this place shortly after it first opened, and it was a totally legit massage as described by Anteres01 and David Banks, eg undies left on.

I can only assume that the person seen by Snapper 79 was a rogue operator, who has probably been since dismissed.

For those on the west of town, I noticed this new parlor has popped up in Kensington since I was last in the area about a month ago. I was going to pop in to see the young lass (30ish) on the front desk however a lady popped in just before me so opted to keep walking.  I'll be back again in around 1 month for my next trim so might give it ago after I get my next trim unless someone else TOFFT in the mean time.

Currently advertising $69 for 1 hour at the moment, open 7 days 10am - 9.15pm. Some pics online of shop front from doesn't have the usual full frontage "massage" signage on the shop front

Thought of that same thing IB, would recommend daytime excursions for those looking to avoid the crowd which can be present in this area

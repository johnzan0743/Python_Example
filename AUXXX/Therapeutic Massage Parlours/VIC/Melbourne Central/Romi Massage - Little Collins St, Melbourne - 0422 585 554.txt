My experience/comments : This place has been advertising a lot on Locanto lately. I was initially confused by the ad since it said "weekend for Booking only". But it turns out it's open Monday-Friday. I called up and was greeted by a guy. It was very hard to understand him as I was wandering through the city. I told him I might call back later and hung up. A couple of minutes later he sent me a text and said I should give them a go and I would definitely not be disappointed with the service. I made a booking and was told to give him a call when I got out the front (appartment building operation). I called when I got there and was told someone would come down to get me. About 2 minutes later a guy showed up and we wandered into the lifts. We got to the apartment and I was greeted by Nina, who was friendly and good looking.

Nina showed me to the room and motioned to the table and left. I took my gear off and left the towel draped over myself as I normally do when one is left out. Nina returned a little later and began the massage. The massage was ok, soft and relaxing but definitely not theraputic. She spent a lot of time on my back and didn't go near the towel at all. I was starting to think it was just a massage place by this stage. She then moved to my legs and again just massaged from my feet up to where the towel ended up. Fuck it I thought, I better say something. I turned to her and said "you can take the towel off if it's getting in your way". She looked confused and said "sorry English not good". Fuck. um.. Ok, I pointed to my arse and said "it's ok to massage there". She pointed and said "ahh ok???". I nodded. She then kept doing what she was doing, although had her hands a ilttle higher up. Still nowhere near where I wanted her to be though. Oh well, at least it was only $60 down the drain.

Then she asks me to turn over which I do. I was expecting a bit of oil on my chest or legs by that stage, but she went straight for between my legs into the tug. Her technique was fantastic and got me there pretty quickly. Talk about a quick turnaround in expectation. Especially since she didn't actually ask if I waned anything, or how much I wanted to pay or anything. I was a bit worried she was going to ask for more than I would have agreed to. But she cleaned me up and then left the room.

I wandered out into the hall when I was dressed and she was waiting for me. She smiled and then walked to the door and opened it. So.. nothing for the extras? And it was a 45 minute massage. So for 30m would have been maybe $50 with extras included. Thats pretty bloody good value in Melbourne.

Next time I'm going to chuck that towel on the floor.

Value for money/recommend? : sort of

My experience/comments :  Did the same as the above review. Had the choice of two girls. I left to towel off and there was no objection from Marma.Not sure if the right name as she hardly spoke english. had a tattoo on the neck.
What then followed was bizarre. Most of the massage was spent on the back with baby oil. If it was a purely legit massage then it was shit. If it was sensuous it was equally shit. She just poked and prodded at my should blades and spine getting up and standing over me at one stage. It was simply annoying and I nearly died of boredom with her routine. Without going anywhere below the waist she then asked me to flip. Of course with nothing sensuous going on I was not even remotely excited but without a word she want straight for the tackle and worked that until the end of the massage. She remained fully clothed and asked for a tip to touch her which took the price from $40 to $50 (I just gave her my change). Then she spent ages with the towels cleaning me up and removing the oil. Really weird. Don't think I'll return.

Well you do get what you pay for. $40 for 30m with hand relief. I thought mine was just that bad cause of the towel - but maybe that's just how they roll. Still - they have a few girls that work that place. Since it's so cheap it would be worth trying out a few and leaving reviews. Might get lucky with a good one. The whole 'straight for the tackle' thing was definitely bizarre though.

Tried again with GiGi - yes they must all be trained the same way. massage way way too hard and only a briefest of tickles around the crack. HJ technique was better.

be warned though - these girls are not massage specialists and not trained properly. My back was stuffed for a few days afterward due to the enormous pressure she was putting on my lower back!

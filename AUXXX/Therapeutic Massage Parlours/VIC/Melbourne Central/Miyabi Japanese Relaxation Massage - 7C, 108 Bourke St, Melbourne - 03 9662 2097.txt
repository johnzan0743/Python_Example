Has anyone heard anything about Miyabi massage. Supposedly staffed by Japanese girls, Ive heard that extras are on offer here - but would like verification if anyone has been.

Yeah I have been a couple of times, good massage bordering on great massage by usually cute japanese girls, nothing ever offered to me and once when I asked was politely declined. Let me know if you have any success, where there is rumour there is usually action. Try the other end of the complex for a guarenteed happy time!

Thanks Sparksy, Ill have to turn on the charm and see how I go - I'll let you know.

As for the other one you mention, is that still up and running? I heard they were shut down, or under investigation or something similar.

SO i visited this location and can confirm what Sparksy and shyguy have said - no luck with extras. I also saw an ad for this place on a popular chinese language website advertising for (chinese) girls who could "shout out" in Japanese, and do oil massage, but noting it was a no-extras service. Theres cheaper chinese massage joints out there, so ill be giving this a miss.

I also visited the other place Sparksy mentioned and got a good $45 rub down (they dont do 45 min massage anymore, only 1/2 or full hour). Extras were $50 with no neg., wouldnt move on this. $95 - total, i gave it a misss, but was a great massage anyway, and a pretty good price.

Services Provided: massage

Value for money/recommend?: Yes

My experience/comments: i had heard good reviews on this venue and decided to try it out. Just for massage only, they were really good and would pin point which part of the body is feeling pain or seems stiff and provide feedback for you. the masseur would also massage more on areas need attention due to stiffness and pain. The massage was really good, feeling relax and rejuvenated after. Base on other punters above(no rnt provided), i still give it a shot and try asking for it, but as per japanese culture, was politely decline. Again. nevertheless, if you're looking for a real good massage, this is it, very proper and your money well spent. unlike some unethical chinese joint.

maybe the next time i might try other miyabi venues. they have another one just down the road 100m from this location and also another in hive shopping centre victoria st abbotsford. might have luck somewhere else. who knows...

 South Melbourne - 0435 018 080
				
Post Content: 
Has anyone had any luck with this crew?  They have been flooding locanto with ads over the last week. I've tried calling the number a few times, no answer. I did get a reply to a text, indicating that the girls they describe in one of their ads is available, but upon getting to their venue, I found the place had another business name on the door, (could be the previous tenant) nobody opened the door, I called and texted again, but go no answer, so basically they wasted my time. It's a house by the way. The number is 0435 018 080. A few of their ad links below.

Could be some form of spam or bot, but that would be a lot of effort going by the number of different ads they have going, and I did get one reply to a text.

They've flooded both massage and the jobs section looking for masseuse.

Probably not even ready yet for customers, but getting awareness out first

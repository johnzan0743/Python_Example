My experience/comments : 
These ads look like the ones for 233 Collins st. Lucky I checked the location cause it's about 10 mins away.

Anyway, I tried to make an appointment for Amanda who was pictured in an ad. Was told Amanda didn't work Monday's but another big boob girl would be on today. No probs, book me in.

Turned up and was buzzed through after a bit of confusion with the keypad. Was greeted at the door by a young, plump girl who showed me into the room. Exchanged cash for the hour and she left me to it. As soon as I was on the table she was back in, grabbed the oil and straight to the crack. Nice! Good massage technique if you like "medium". There were no options to change it up but it was ok by me. She worked through each leg, and then onto the back, always returning to the ass for a bit. Was friendly, great english and happy to chat.

Came the turn and I asked if she did extras. Hand only ($30) was the reply. It was pretty warm in there and she started complaining about being too warm. I suggested she removed her clothing if it would make her more comfotable. She said for another $20 she'd oblige. I'd been staring at her chest for the last 10 minutes and nothing was going to stop me getting a look at those puppies so I nodded approval and out they came. She moved closer to me during the tug so I could get better access to them and then got me over the line pretty quickly with good technique.

I went off for a shower and she then invited me back onto the bed afterwards cause I still had time left. She gave me a great head massage for the remainder of the time.

Pros - lovely girl, friendly, and keen to talk. Good massage technique, good finish, great rack.
Cons - she's a larger girl if you're not into that and also has a few tatts if you're not into that (either of these could be plusses though..)

It was a good service. The price was fairly high but it was very decent and unrushed.

Saw this place reviewed in the bronze lounge and decided to give it a try. 

Organised appointment easily with AJ via text who advised that she would not be working but that Vivi and Bella were available. AJ likes to call you babe/Hun etc via text and seems pretty nice. 

Booked for 1 hour and turned up at the appointed time. Texted that I was outside and was asked to call for the apartment number. Easily done and was buzzed up the lift with no hassle. 

Was met by Bella who wasn't stunning, but cute. Long hair. Slightly curvy. Decent chest from what I could see. 

I had originally booked just a normal 1 girl massage but Bella offered 4 hands with the other girl (who I had yet to meet) for $150 hr. Having never had a 4 hands massage before I thought I'd give it a try. 

Was taken into a small room converted to a massage room. Table in the middle with clean towels. Lights on the walls. Decent attempt at creating a relaxing environment. Was asked to remove clothes and wait. 

Shortly after, Bella returned with Vivi. Vivi is tall and skinny. Not as nice looking as Bella though. Asked what kind of massage I was after and I requested strong. 

What followed was kind of strange. Bella gave a really good theraputic massage. Seemed like she has had training. Vivi's massage was all light touches and strokes over the areas that Bella wasn't working on. Plenty of touches around the crack and sack from Vivi. 

As a result I couldn't really get relaxed or horny, as I had one girl getting right into the hard massage while the other was trying to be sensual. Quite an odd experience. 

All the while there was a lot of chat with Vivi translating for Bella who's English isn't great. 

Flip time and they both started sensual with lots of accidentally on purpose brushes. Eventually Vivi asked if I wanted a HJ to which I agreed with no mention of price. 

I asked if it was going to be both of them and Vivi advised it would be just her as Bella was shy. 

Bella left the room and I enquired about touching/topless/nude. Only fully clothed was on offer as she had her period. Outside touching was allowed. Not sure if there is more on offer when she isn't on her period. 

HJ was decent and unrushed. She cleaned me up nicely and I went off to the shower. Although it wasnt requested I tipped $25. 

Dont think i would return for Vivi, but might for Bella as I'd like to see what is on offer from her. She looked to have a pretty nice rack. On the way out Bella very enthusiastically asked me to come back and see her again. 

Wouldnt have another 4 hands at this place. But the service was better than some places I have been, and not rushed. 

It is also in a convenient location, open till 10pm and has a shower. All pluses for me.[/COLOR][COLOR=#3E3E3E]

Services Provided : Massage, hand relief, nude massage

Value for money/recommend? : Yep

My experience/comments : 
After a screwup with a booking at another venue I gave this place another call after a recent good experience with AJ. Didn't bother asking who was on, just made a time and headed on down.

The door was opened by a friendly girl. Not the best face ever, and looked a bit skinny, but certainly passable. I was ushered into the room on the left (there's another makeshift room on the other side of the apartment which I'm glad I didn't get). Anyway, I paid the $60 for 45 minutes, and she left me alone to get undressed. Walked in about 10 seconds after I was up on the table, and said hello. Her English wasn't great. She seemed to understand me fairly well though - I just had trouble understanding her. She started a little small talk but after a few "sorry, could you say that again" soon got on with the massage.

Technique was ok, she put a reasonable amount of pressure on my back, and felt around each of the muscles as she went. Started high and worked her way down, lots of touching the ass, but away from the crack. Then went onto the legs and a lot of time brushing the inner thighs with a few tackle rubs. For a 45 minute massage, the flip came early at about 15 minutes. She asked straight away if I wanted a massage 'there'. Told me it would be extra. I asked how much and her reply was $50, or $70 for topless. Jesus, thats a lot of inflation in one week. I told her AJ did it for $30 and $50 topless. She then agreed to strip completely for $70. Hell why not. I figure it's worth paying a bit more the first time with a new girl in case she's good. Now, although her face wasn't the best, holy shit did she have a nice body. perfect curves, tight ass, and a great rack I was amazed she hid so well under those clothes.

So she starts the front massage then, and I started wandering all over her body with my hands. Went down her ass and then around between her legs and she pulled back "you can touch me anywhere except there". Damn. Oh well. I told her to go slow for the rest which she did. Great technique, took about 20 minutes to get me there and I'm fairly sure I hit the roof when I did. She then wiped me down with a towel that was a bit too cold, and then sanitised her hands before giving me a great head massage.

So, pricey, yes indeed. But what a view, and what a finish.

Person's Name : BB

Establishment : 7 Katherine Place, Hotel room, CBD

Date of Visit : Tuesday 16th Dec 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_3...se-of-men.html n.b. This place has changed its number a few times recently. I'm 90% sure this is the right ad. They will respond with 7 Katherine place as the address if you SMS them.

Hours of Business : 10am - 10pm (It was Jasmine's second day, times unknown)

Rates : $60 / 45m, $40 HR

Age : Mid 20's

Size/shape : 8 / A cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, hand relief

Value for money/recommend? : Not bad.

Experience:
This place is becoming a regular haunt for me lately. So far all the girls have been pretty good. All young, good personalities, and plenty of services on offer. BB seemed to fit that mould when I walked in. She was very relaxed, chatty and forward with her conversation topics and willingness to have a yap. Exchanged the cash and I jumped onto the table. She walks in and asks what sort of massage I was after. I said firm to see how she went. The massage was pretty good. I wouldn't have been too unhappy if things didn't progress further. There wasn't much of a hint of extras during the actual massage though. She avoided the ass and stopped about halfway up my legs. But then, suddenly the massage stopped and the teasing began. She went from firm massage strokes to very light fingers up and down my legs, between my thighs, and plenty of incidental strokes between my legs. This went on for about 10 minutes at which point I was ready to take things into my own hands.

Finally she flipped me, and not a second too soon. Asks the question, and a big yes from me. No indication that she was going to offer anything other than HR. I didn't even bother to ask. She was ok with me touching under her clothes though, but did the arm clamp thing when I reached around the front. Took things slow, and made a big mess. Good technique.

Not sure why I didn't think this was great value. I prefer a bit more touching, and the option for topless, especially after my recent experiences here. I also prefer a bit of time left at the end for a head massage or something after the main event. But it's my own fault for not asking I suppose. YMMV!

She certainly hasn't let the team down anyway. I'll be back. I was told they have 10 girls available, so far I've seen 4 of them. 6 to go

Does anyone know if they've moved or changed numbers?

The old numbers I had for this place aren't working and the ad in the most recent review has a different number. Ive contacted them and its on 233 collins.

Probably same owners.

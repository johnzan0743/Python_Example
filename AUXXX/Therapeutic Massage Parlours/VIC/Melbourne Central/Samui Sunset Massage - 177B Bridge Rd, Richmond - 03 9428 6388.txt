Sought a decent massage and got a surprise.

I had been in Melbourne on business and decided to stay and meet a friend and go to the footie on Saturday. So he had family stuff on in the morning and we agreed to meet for lunch and go to footie and I'd fly back that evening.

Went for nice walk around Melbourne, had brekkie and decided to wander around Richmond before we met for lunch at pub there.

So I decide i'd like a real deep proper Thai massage I had an excellent one in Port Melbourne once but thought well if I'm in Richmond I may as well try here. So I use my iPhone to google one and this place pops up first in the search engine.

Off I go - into a modern building which is empty downstairs - yes retail is in recession - and a lovely foyer and nice lady meets me and I forget but it was like $75 for an hour. 

Into the room with a nice young woman who kinda looked like a country girl if you know what I mean - Thai of course. And very chatty. There was no table just mattress on floor in quite a big room. Had nice look to it.

She asks me take off undies so again here is a hint. Nice massage and she did want to chat which was nice. Flip over and naked so she is massaging and occasionally brushing the old boy. Finally I say do you offer different massages. She obliquely replies "What do you mean?" I get the feeling in Melbourne they are not allowed to solicit. Am I right? Anyway by now the little feller is upright. So she finally says $50 for handjob. I ask if she will take off her clothes and NO. So I take up th offer and she proceeds with a gentle teasing and then towards full stroking very nice handjob.

Now was it value for money? No. Did I enjoy it? Yes but had better massages and frankly as i wanted a real massage that day was a bit disappointed. Would I go back? No.

Frankly if I had been seeking a rub-and-tug i would have logged in here and gone with recommended places.

Person's Name : Patty

Establishment : Samui Sunset Massage, Richmond

Date of Visit : 7/06/12

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :177B Bridge Rd, Richmond - 03 9428 6388

Hours of Business :10-10

Rates : 30mins / $45 + $50

Age : 24?

Size/shape : 10 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage / R&T

Value for money/recommend? : not really - all up $95 for soft massage and just ok tug.

My experience/comments : Had dinner down on Bridge Rd so in the area and thought try this place. Decor and set is nice and the room I was in had very nice relaxation feel to it with lighting & music. The girl was attractive and I stripped down nude so as to indicate I was expecting more than just a massage. Had to go through a pop quiz before she really offered. We started negotiating at $20 for HJ and in the end she said the going rate was $50. I paid up as I was there already and my little head told my big head to shut up and pay the money as it was standing up wanting some attention! She finished up with wipe down with hot towel. 
WIR? place is clean and massage nice but feel for total of $95 for an R&T with no nude & no extras, I can get better value elsewhere.

Rates : 60mins / 75

Age : 25-30

Services Provided : R&T 

Value for money/recommend? : Expensive / Ultra Clean

My experience/comments : 

Have been driving past this place on Bridge Rd and never really knew it existed, only upon walking down the street did I notice it, so headed up the stairs.

Was shown to a small room with a futon bed and left to myself, so I stripped bare and awaited who I'd be seeing ... hoping it would be the receptionist who was quite full breasted.

Nancy arrived shortly (bugger, not the receptionist), very slim with a pretty face.

It was my first time here, but someone I knew had already given me the score of how things run at this establishment.

It's pretty well $50 extra for hand relief and not much else on the menu ... but would love to be told different ?

It's on the expensive side, however, the place is clean and professional so would appeal to those not wanting to go to some of the dodgier RnT places available.

Nancy's massage was fair to good and she warmed up quite a bit during the session.  

On the flip her 'other' technique was probably better than her massage one ... slow, then faster, backing off, speeding up till on one of those occasions I blew all over the place.

I will return, just maybe not in a hurry ... the expense aside, the cleanliness does appeal sometimes.

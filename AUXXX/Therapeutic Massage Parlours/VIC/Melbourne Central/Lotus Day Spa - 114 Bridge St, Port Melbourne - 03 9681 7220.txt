My experience/comments : Saw this place open recently, was wondering if it was a special kind of place because it just had that look - despite the big list of things like "hot stone massage" advertised. I wonder what they would do if someone actually asked for that.. Anyway I was keen to try it out as only Samui does extras out of the 10 massage joints in the Port Melb strip.

So I wondered in and as soon as I saw the ML i knew I was in luck. She looked more like what you'd see in an asian full service place, quite attractive but dressed for action not for massage. Massage started and it was actually quite ok - she's not going to solve a pulled muscle but it was better than a lot of places. I got a bit of arm between her legs, and her sitting on me with her legs spread so I was pretty happy. After a bit of rub and tickle, came the flip and the universal sign. She wanted $50 for tug and $50 for nude. We negotiated a bit and I got her down, but I think I was only in luck as it was a really quiet day. Anyway, great little body, shaved sweet looking puss. No touching down below was allowed but there was a little bit of body slide, nothing to write home about. The hand action was great though, she had great technique.

After that came the shower - be warned the flick mixer appears to be backwards. And the whole shower looks like it's been salvaged from the last massage joint and installed in "quality" fashion. The bloody oil they use does not want to come off. I even had a second shower at home for like 30 minutes before I stopped feeling like an oil slick. So OK massage, attractive girl, naked on offer, but nothing to write home about.
Oh and I think she was trying to pick me up as she tried to ask me to dinner.

So I returned today as I was there on the street with a pocket full of cash.. anyway. Got assigned some really big girl. I know it's not very PC, but why is a RnT shop that can only have 3 girls hiring someone who won't appeal to the vast majority of customers? Anyway, it turned into a pure massage. She seemed surprised at the no extra's thing. Massage wasn't great either.

My experience/comments : Very average massage. No extra's available. Waste of time really. This place must have cracked down on it's girls, but without extra's it won't stay in business when there's 4 or 5 good legit shops with proper thai oil massage within 200m.

Person's Name : Cici

Establishment : Lotus Day Spa

Date of Visit : November 28, 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 114 Bridge Road, Port Melbourne 9681 7220

Hours of Business : 10-8pm

Rates : $45 half hour

Age : 35

Size/shape : Petite

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Nude Massage HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : I first visited this place a month or so back after going into Samui Sunset (around the corner) but they were booked out. So, being at a lose end, went here instead. I think it has only recently been branded Lotus Day Spa so must be a recent acquisition to the ever growing chain. First time here at a sweet young thing called Jenny who gave a passable massage and fully clothed but expensive HJ.

Thought I'd venture back. The SYT must have moved on because they hadn't heard of her but the lady who welcomed me gave me a knowing look that said she'd look after me. Asked her name and she was another Cici from China. Mid to late 30's I'd guess. A very tidy body though. Having double checked I'd been there before she wasted no time on the massage and quickly had her hand between my legs. And I quickly had mine up her short skirt. She quoted $20 for HJ. I asked if she'd do anything else and she said no. But on the offer of another $20 she had her top up. I had a quick play but the bra was getting in the way. So she quickly removed that and then dropped the dress and panties as well and was naked in no time. My hands were allowed to room and play with her soft, untrimmed bush. Tit sucking was allowed and some light kissing as well and, before too long, I was over the line.

So at $45 + $40 a decent result. Cici was a bit older than my usual preference but very accommodating and happy to put in the hard yards to satisfy a horny customer. Sounds like she is there most days and maybe manages the shop. The others I've seen, on  both visits, have been much younger.

Thank you for the correction and sorry, for the _long_ delay in re-locating this thread.

Mods don't mind PMs asking them to do useful things such as this, so
if nothing happens for a week or so after your post that such-and-such
is in the wrong place, go ahead and ask by PM.

No probs Fartichoke. I don't think Lotus Day Spa have touched their website in years and it's very out of date. They have a shop on Mount Road Moonee Ponds that they've never listed and the city shop has moved from Collins St to Elizabeth St a few months back.

And I know Nikki was setting up a shop in Port Melbourne, so I'd suggest it's part of the chain.

Date of Visit : 10/8


Rates : $60 for 45 min. $40 RnT

Age : 30?

Size/shape : Slightly Chubby

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : 

Value for money/recommend? : Nothing special

My experience/comments : I'd avoided this place after a couple of "no go's" when asking for extra's. But the other locals were all booked out so I dropped in. this place only has two girls, so half the time you cna't just walk in, but this time I was lucky. Two girls, one tall and slim, one short and stocky. When I walked in the tall one walked out :-(

Anyway, in the room, kit off, massage started. Not the worst massage every, but it was ok. A little tackle tickle and the odd browneye flick before the flip.
On the flip we looked at each other, she raised an eyebrow and I nodded and we were off. The Tug was OK, nothing to write home about, but she did allow (clothed) touching wherever I wanted. It was a tug, and an average massage for a fairly cheap price so I was OK. But this place still uses baby oil rather than massage oil, far too much of it, and nothing special in the massage or tug. Good for when you just need to dump a load.

Establishment : Lotus Day Spa - Oriental Massage  Bridge Street Port Melbourne

Date of Visit : January 21st 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 114 Bridge Road, Port Melbourne 9681 7220

Hours of Business : 10-8pm

Rates : $60 for 45 minutes and $30 for HJ

Age : 28

Size/shape : Size 8ish with big boobs under her top

Nationality or Ethnicity : Vietnamese  - Saigon
Services Provided : Massage and HJ (clothes on)

Value for money/recommend? : Yes was OK and got what I needed

My experience/comments : I couldnt get into friends place as he forgot to leave key out and so had time to kill before he got home, had seen this place on driving and walking past a few times and so decided to give it a try.

Young girl was at front to greet me, asked how long, initially I said an hour but she said she had booking so could only do 45 minutes, I accepted this, gave her $ and was shown to front room.  Now even though the walls go to the top they are very thin as I could here another lady having a phone conversation in another room so you have to be quiet in this place.

After I got undressed and lay on table, Eva comes back in and proceeds to give me a nice relaxing oil massage, it was a bit fast but still nice touching and feeling and when she went down the legs her hands would run past the boys and I appreciated the contact and got hard in no time which then made it easier for her to continue rubbing her hands past me when massaging the legs and bum.

She wipes off oil dry towel and asks me to flip which i do. She then proceeds to massage my chest and then down to legs and looks at me as I am gently rubbing her legs and patting her shapely ass just to let her know I appreciate what she is doing.  She then asks would I like to be taken care of, I politely say yes, she says will cost extra and I nod in acceptance.  She then proceeds to give me a great HJ.  I can lightly touch her boobs through her top but no going under the top and no go in between legs

Anyway this is my first time and she doesn't know me so I am happy she offered HJ with no trouble.  she gets me over the line and ensures I am completely empty.

Cleans me up with a hot washer and dry towell.  She goes out and lets me get dressed.  she comes back in with glass of water and I give her $30 extra which is the usual here ( i was told as initially handed over $20 and she said sorry its always $30 here)

Anyway I am a happy man as donated my load to her, she got her tip and we were both smiling

Another happy punt.

Person's Name : Miso or Misu

Establishment : Bridge St Port Melbourne

Date of Visit : June 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/lotus-day-spa-melbourne

Hours of Business : 10 - 8

Rates : $40 for 30 mins $30 RnT, $50 naked

Age : Mid 20's

Size/shape :  Average

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

Services Provided : Naked RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Yes 

My experience/comments : Dropped into this place with low expectations. It's the place I go when I just want a wank, and don't care about the massage. 
This time I got Miso (or Misu?) a Japanese girl of average looks. Went into the room, nuded up and she came in. I was pretty quick to ask for naked and she offered for $50 which I thought was a bargain. She nuded up too and started the massage. It was actually pretty damned good, way better than I was expecting from this place. 
It was only a 30 minute massage so after 15 mins of nice relaxing long-stroke style massage I flipped over. I asked if she did anything else and she said a polite but firm no. So I let her start the tug, she was pretty damned good again, very gentle and with varied technique. She also loved to suck my nipples, so I asked to return the favour. She loved this, so with some tongue action and a little gentle persuasion, the next thing you know I had two fingers in her snatch while she wanked me off. She was a lovely girl the whole time - i get the feeling that with a few more visits and taking things gently that pretty much anything would be on offer, and that her firm "no" was because I was a first timer. 

Things happened, she cleaned me up with a towel, then treated me to a GF style kiss on the way out. WIR? Sure, except i can't as i've moved away.

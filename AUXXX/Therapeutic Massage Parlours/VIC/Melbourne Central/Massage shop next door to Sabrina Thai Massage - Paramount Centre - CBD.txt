My experience/comments : 

Had 20 minutes to kill, and was heading to Sabrinas when this smily lady with a decent rack and nice set of pins enticed me in. Tina. Paid my $25 for 20 minutes, she came back into the room quick smart while I was still undressing to give me my change. What followed was 5 or so minutes of negotiation. It started at $50 for a clothed handy, went through various permutations, and ended up at $50 for a pull up / pull down (quasi-nude) HJ with light finger of the puss allowed. Tina has a nice MILFy body and got wet very quickly, HJ was a bit jackhammer. Her colleague was a real old battleaxe who I found out was the boss, and I'd avoid her.

I was then running late for a meeting, so headed off without grabbing any of the usual details, including which days Tina works. Sorry mods!

I'd go back for a less rushed session with Tina, especially when the boss isn't around.

Dean.

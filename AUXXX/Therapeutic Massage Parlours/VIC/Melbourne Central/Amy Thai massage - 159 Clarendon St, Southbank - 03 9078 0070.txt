I poked my head in the other to find out what is on offer. As soon as I used the word sensual the female I spoke with made it very clear that isn't on the menu. She was one of the masseuses not just the receptionist.

I wouldn't bother unless you want a straight massage.

It would be good to give this thread an address and a phone number (to perhaps encourage a review).

Is this the place, Contact - Amy Thai Massage Southbank ?

I would not bother Farti .it is in Clarendon street Sth Melbourne. Great for a straight massage but that is all.
I tried four or five  times and with different girls and the boss Amy,( who gave a great massage) but I gave up

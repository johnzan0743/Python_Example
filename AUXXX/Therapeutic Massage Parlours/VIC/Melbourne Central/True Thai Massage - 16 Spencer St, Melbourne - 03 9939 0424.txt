My experience/comments : I had some time to spare while I was in town and decided to try True Thai that I had seen previously. I went into the well presented parlour which was attached to a hotel next door. After I had paid I was lead to a room which was split with two doors and two tables seperated by a curtain. I noticed that on the ceiling there was a video camera which could see both sides of the room. I was told to get undressed but to leave my underwear on. Once I had done that I put myself on the table and when the lady came back I enjoyed a nice massage but did not leave happy lol

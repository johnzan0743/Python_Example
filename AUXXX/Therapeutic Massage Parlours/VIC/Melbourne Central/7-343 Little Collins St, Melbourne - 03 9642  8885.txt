I've been going here for years. Depending on the girl, you get different levels of service in my experience. Always gone the $50/30 minute option, except with the sadly departed Lisa (and if anyone knows if she is still working and where I would love to know -- she was the attractive PRC with long hair who worked there in 2008 and was studying to be a pastry chef)

Frida: agree it's a fabulous massage from her, but never has a HJ been offered, nor when I have asked has she been interested. She loves watching me whack off though, so there's no shyness on her part. I wonder what I am doing wrong?
Betty: seems to run the place. No HJ, but happy to provide a bit of oil and hang around while you finish it off.
Annie: great sensual massage, but will leave the room
Cherie: there are two ladies who work there by this name. One Cherie gives a good HJ, and allows rubbing through clothes; the other one: see Betty
Nancy (no longer there I think): BYO rubber, resulted in FS for +$20. Used to go off like an absolute firecracker. I think she's working in Ascot Vale somewhere now

The upshot with this place is you are pretty much guaranteed a good massage, but the rest of it is up in the air...

And if anyone has any leads on the lovely Lisa, please let me know...

Person's Name: Mary

Establishment: 7/343 Lt Collins St

Date of Visit: 18-May

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: As above

Hours of Business: Monday - Friday 10:30 - 6pm

Rates: $50 for 30 mins

Age: 20s

Size/shape: tall and slim

Nationality or Ethnicity: Asian

Services Provided: Massage, RnT

Value for money/recommend?: Had to leave a gift of $20 for what was a pretty decent tug. I'll certainly try and get back on a Wednesday in future...

My experience/comments: I had the choice of Frida or Mary, and, as I've seen Frida several times before, thought I'd give Mary a go. She only works on Wednesdays. I asked for a soft massage with minimal oil, and that's exactly what I got. We got chatting during the massage (I prefer that to silence), and the usual story; she's a student, working there part time. She was concerned that the massage was too soft, but I told her to keep going.

Unusually for the masseuses in this place, she was happy to give the beans and frank a bit of a tickle both pre and post the flip, but nothing approaching a tug. I asked her, she looked a bit worried but we agreed on a $20 gift, and she gave what amounted to a pretty nice tug.

I've had the full range in this place over the years, from covered with towel to even getting a FS (a lady named Nancy, long gone regrettably). The one thing that is consistent though is that for $50 you will get a corker of a massage -- I've had their harder massages when I've had some sports injuries and they have been great. What anyone who has not been there before can expect at a minimum is a good sensual massage from OK to very good looking young Asian girls and a DIY ending with the girl present. It's clean and discreet, and the ladies who work there are good value for a chat.

Date of Visit:21june2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink:As above

Hours of Business: 

Rates:50$ per 30mins

Age:40s

Size/shape:Skinny

Nationality or Ethnicity:Chinese

Services Provided:On thi occasion not really sure, I think I will call it application of oil( I'll expand on this below)

Value for money/recommend?:Not a massage so no.

My experience/comments: (Here you must give at least a general description of the experience which you have had - 

 word minimum is required to give fellow members an idea of time spent - "Ill be back" or "good value" is not a sentence or review. )

Well, I had to write this as everyone should give Sarah a miss - not even sure why she is there.

The massage was not a massage, some people refer to it as painting the fence.... In this case the fence would have paint dripping down it I lost count at the times Sarah walked around the table to get more oil. I mentioned this early on and she said oil is good for the skin, which in small amounts is but I felt like I was getting buried in it.

Next point she completed this massage with one hand, I was laughing at this point and said hey it's okay to use two hands! Her reply was it is better for the flow? I said this is too soft so she said harder like this and there was no change so I left it there made her get me a hot towel.

So to summarize - if you want a one handed, airy no pressure massage ask for Sarah, if you want what most of us do, ask for Frieda - she actually uses two hands and applies varying pressure as requested

Again word to the wise get anyone other than Sarah lol

Mary's great (she's a very sweet person), but you'll just get the tug for +$20. Only there on Wednesdays AFAIK. Top massage.

bigbadbob, I've had real trouble getting anything from Cherry, despite plenty of visits. Be keen on any tips to get her over the line, so to speak, as her sensual massage is great, and I'd imagine her tug is as well.

ghen, I believe Cherry is there Mon, Tue and Thursdays.

Hope the above helps!

Does anyone know of any other places like this in town? Legit, but with the possibility of extras. 

There used to be (I'm talking 10 years ago), a really attractive, statuesque, lady (Maria someone?) who work privately in the Block Arcade. Gave a great massage, would not do a tug, but the two times I visited her said she liked to watch and actually got off on watching her clients jack off at the end of a massage! 

A place called Natural Stress Therapy in Collins St (Spring St end) used to have a busty masseuse working there called Trudi (I think) who would rip her boobs out for viewing pleasure only (no touching) while she gave you a tug at the end of the session, but she's long gone, and the place now seems to be some kind of beauty clinic.

Cherry is a bit of a tough one, she was rather reluctant (was happy for DIY), I had to do some sweet talking. She did ask me not to mention to anyone that she did that, especially any of the other girls there. I tried to neg. the price down too, but no luck there - was $20 tip. She was a lovely girl, and it was well worth it.

Person's Name : Cherry

Establishment : As above

Date of Visit : Today: 26 July 2011

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As above

Hours of Business :  10:30-6 -- note, they often take last bookings at 5, and the sign on the door that says they are open Saturdays is incorrect

Rates : $50/30 mins + gift (varies $20-$30)

Age : 20s

Size/shape : As discussed, slim, reasonably tall for PRC, looks fine in her clothes and I suspect even better out of them

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Massage HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes 

My experience/comments : 

I made another booking with Cherry, figuring I was going to get a damned fine massage no matter what. That was indeed the case. We had a decent enough chat during it as well. I thought about what Ghen said above, and post flip persuaded her to engage in the tug for a gift of $20. She's got a peculiar two handed action, but it was damned fine. I left with a smile on my dial... good way to end a wintry Melbourne afternoon.

I would second Ghen's comments, tough to talk around, but once done so, no (obvious anyway) signs of reluctance -- if anything, she seemed to be getting into it a bit...

Cherry is currently working Mon, Tue and Thu there.

I rang the Bentleigh branch today. They have closed the city shop, the person I spoke to seemed to think that they were planning on reopening in the city in the next few weeks, but was very vague about times and locations, etc. I've been asked to ring back tomorrow to speak to the boss, who may have more info. If I get a chance around work commitments, will do so and report back here.

The actual shop is up for sale (found out via google); they are asking $288K for it, and it's advertised as a vacant possession.

I spoke with Cherry yesterday at the Moorabbin branch. She said a number of the girls had gone home to China, not enough to work both places, so the city shop closed down. She is under the impression that a city venue will start up again in October sometime, but asked me to keep in touch for updates.

I popped in here the other day and saw Selina at the front desk. She remembered me, and seemed none too pleased to see me. I was told, in no uncertain terms, that they are now "legitimate" only, and underwear is to remain on at all times. Now, I don't have too much of a problem with that, but TBH I found her attitude extremely snarky -- I've always been ( to my mind anyway) polite and pleasant when I've been there. Not a good advertisement really; quite disappointing.

BTW admins, they have a new phone number: 9602 1606.

Rang Cherry and told yes come now 'we are free, rocked up and seems firstly Cherry was not in at all from what Selina told me, so i waited regardless.
Started with normal massage but definately not deep tissue, roaming hands all over the place, but did relieve some neck pain.
Moved to lower back and legs, and she took by jocks off, ok thought something may happen, but only slight touching of inner thigh.
Asked at the end for extras and was told its self service we dont do that here....

Anyone had any joy here recently? And by joy I mean actually getting in for a massage at all? The last massage I got there was about 4 months ago, African girl called Melody who gave an excellent straight massage but nothing more on offer. Since then, nada.

I popped in during the week as the phone wasn't connected. The chap who is often there (I believe his name is John) was there along with a new lady (I believe this is the Sarah who does Lomi Lomi there -- Aussie, blonde, nose piercing). The above phone number no longer seems to work and I was given a new one to try in future 9642 2772. 

For a while he said he had a couple of French birds working there, but they were always busy. Just wondering if anyone knew what is going on, and if you've had any joy, any talent there. I fondly remember from about 4-5 years ago Lisa and Nancy...

Rang the new number, actually got the chance to make a booking so I did after a lunch appointment in town. Got in there, Rita introduced herself to me, and it was all looking promising. Got into the room, absolutely towel must be draped over me. Asked for a soft sensual massage, and got a very nice medium - soft massage that lasted the full 30 minutes (and then some). No flip, no mention of extras.

Rita is a friendly lady who provides a good massage but I do not think anything else is on the cards.

At Emmaline's suggestion I saw Kate this morning.
Pleasant strawberry blonde English girl in her late twenties. Size 10 with perky tits under a loose shirt and a well figured bum under loose also pants.
Had a tattoo behind her ear which suggested she may be quite open minded.
That's where the fun ends. Told to prepare and lay down covered with the towel. Crap massage got slightly better over time but avoided all the fun places. Halfway through I asked about something more sensual and was told no. That's where her chattiness ended and she shorted me by 10 minutes.
Seems Emmaline or the tall girl from Iceland or both are good for an R&T.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Caucasian

Services Provided : Massage 

Value for money/recommend? : Yes , for straight massage only

My experience/comments : 

Based on hearing that this place now seems to be open for business again, I dropped in on spec. Saw a nice looking brown haired lady at the front counter called Claire who asked me to return in 20 minutes and I would see her. She gave me a knowing glance and she was wearing clothes that looked easily removable, so I said sure thing. The vibe was good. Came back in 20 minutes and was ushered into a room by Claire. Asked for a medium massage and got one I'd describe as medium-hard. Top notch massage. No need for towel, but early in the discussion it ends up Claire does professional massage only. We had a decent chat though. She's been there a month, works Mondays only. She was saying that John, the guy who runs the place now, had his main therapist leave a few months back, so he's been recruiting and is effectively rebooting the business.

Claire gave a great massage. I'll try and see Emmaline or the Icelandic lass (anyone know her name?) and report back.

This place has changed so much over the years. Initially it was a good place to go for a massage and occasional happy ending, then there were the years of Lisa (the attractive PRC girl with D-cup tits she couldn't wait to get out and did without doubt the best HJ I've ever experienced) and Nancy (who was always up for a root for +$20 provided you BYO condom), then the strange period when you had no idea if the place was open or shut. Now it seems to be heading back to the first state -- good massage, possible HE. Could be some fun times ahead.

Saw Emmaline today. Can report that she's strictly legit. She's a qualified sports therapist, and I got an awesome straight massage, absolutely nothing in terms of extras. She mentioned she has a boyfriend and they are going around Oz in about 6 weeks. He's a lucky man, because she's a nice unit. Slim and compact with a D rack.

When I arrived I also met the Icelandic chick. Ye Gods. Gotta go back and see her. Think Abba meets that Finnish heavy metal band that won Eurovision a few years back. She's tall -- well over 6 foot -- Amazonian body, masses of black hair cascading over her shoulders and seemed very pleasant and friendly.

So that's two of the current crop there who are legit only.

Apparently the US girl Lisa is very popular: anyone here had the pleasure?

Yes, came the reply, $50 for HJ, fully clothed. It ended up DIY was $0 with no objections from her, so I went for that option.

Great massage, but $50 for HJ... sheesh.

My experience/comments : 

Was in the area late this afternoon, so rang and Claire answered. She said that there was her and a lady called Heather. Was in the mood for a tug, and knew that Claire won't do it, so I asked for the other lady. It ends up she had popped out for a bite to eat, but Claire said she'd call her and offered to call me back to let me know. I said I'd call Claire in 10 minutes. Rang back, and Heather was there waiting, so I popped up 5 or 10 minutes later to be greeted by Heather.

Went into the room, asked for a soft sensual, got a knowing smile, and lay down on the table. Then the towel came on. Ah. I wouldn't describe the massage I received as soft, but boy it was good. And she did some great kneading of the glutes that was both excellent and erotic at the same time. Finished up with a head massage, no action, and I was too blissed out by the massage to bother spoiling the mood (and I suspect getting a no) to ask.

WIR? Yes, and probably for longer, but purely for massage. Heather works Mondays only, with the very occasional Thursday thrown in.

I notice they've changed the name and google doesn't reveal anything...

Update on this, as I finally got in the door.

First up, the phone number is 9642 8885. They have cards printed with the 9670 number on it, and after a bit of mucking around with Sarah (see below) we established the correct number. Mods, if you could please update the thread title, that would be great.

So anyway I dropped in as I had to be in the area anyway, to find the usual locked door, return at 1230. I got caught up at Lotus, but ended up returning at 1 to find door locked but no clock saying when they would be back. So I knocked a few times. Eventually, a lady of Pacific Island appearance came through and answered the door. It ends up she is Sarah who does Lomi Lomi for her own clients there (she sublets a space from the owner from what I could tell). I enquired about other masseuses, and she indicated that there are only 3:

Claire (reviewed earlier, no go)
Heather (reviewed earlier, no go)
Kaz (reviewed earlier, pricey).

At least now I have the number so I can call and see who's on, and if there's any more than these three (plus Sarah who isn't taking new clients).

Dean.

Tried again here today, as I was in the area. The number just goes through to John's other business' voicemail, and when I dropped in today, at about 4:45pm, everyone had packed up and gone home.

Not really sure WTF is happening here, as I've heard on the grapevine there's a hot DD-busted Asian ML working there who provides FS. But rather than a DD-bust, all I get when I go there is a bust (no massage either!)

Anyone else have any further info?

Cheers,
Dean

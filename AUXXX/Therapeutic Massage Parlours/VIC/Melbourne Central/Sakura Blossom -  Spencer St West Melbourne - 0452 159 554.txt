GENKI DESUKA?
My name is Leelo. Im 21 years old sakura blossom from japan lol.
I do massage in my free time with couple of my Japanese friends. They all 21 years old. If you like to get nice relaxing oil massage by young Japanese girls please sms me. 
I will make your stress away with my hands. 

Please note Im not offering sex but willing to confort you with my magical fingers. 
Im close to southern cross station CBD


There is nothing on offer here. Yes they are japanese, yes they are young, and yes the one I had was cute. But it would have to be the worst massage I have ever had in my life. She knew nothing about massage, had no ability to apply any pressure, and basically did the same thing to each body part about 400 times.
Longest hour of my life.

I had to go straight to an old favourite afterwards to remove the memory.

Value for money/recommend? : For the massage, yes

My experience/comments : I noted the Gumtree advertisement and looked like there was a good chance it might be RnT.  Having said that, I was coming off a long, stressful and tiring day and I was just looking for a massage, very much in two minds about the tug.  Walked in without a booking, attractive middle eastern looking mamasan took my $ and showed me through to the end room.  This place is in a new building and the fit-out is brand new.  Nice big fully enclosed rooms with new fittings and has a totally legit feel.  I was instructed to remove my clothes and lay down on the table, no mention of leaving undies on .  I was just finishing undressing when Jenny comes in - totally unfazed by my nudity and waits having a good look at me while I finish folding my clothes and getting onto the table.

Once on the table Jenny drapes me with a towel and commences a firm but very sensual oil massage.  I have to say her massage was one of the best I have had, legit or otherwise.  We had a good chat, shop only opened the previous week, sister shop in Carlton and Jenny has only worked for this operation for 2 days.  Her massage was excellent throughout and absolutely recommended.

It was a strange experience in some ways:

1. Jenny correctly draped me throughout and at no stage did her hands slip into non-legit areas despite encouraging sounds from me and lifting if hips at appropriate moments
2. At times her pubic mound was grinding into my arms or her breasts were being rubbed on the back of my head as she was reaching down to my bum - I noticed she has quite short arms so there was a lot of body contact for her to reach across or along my body .
3. Jenny is highly skilled in sensual massage but when I asked, she hesitantly suggested extras were not available here.  I have to say, she didn't sound particularly convincing.
4. Once Jenny had left me to get dressed, I noted the tissue box on the table and when I lifted the lid on the shiny new rubbish bin there were quite a few used tissues in evidence.  However, I was not about to drag one out to investigate further.

Once I was dressed, I returned to in reception where Jenny was waiting for me.  There were 2 other girls there and an Aussie papasan. I asked Jenny for a shop card - confusion amongst the assembled company - place is so new they don't have any 

I so liked Jenny's massage, I booked her again for the following evening to see if perhaps familiarity would expand her attention and if not, well I would get an outstanding massage out of it. - Read the next installment.

New shop with excellent fit-outJenny delivers and excellent massage and is recommendedGood priceJury is out on level of services provided.

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : This is the following installment from my previous review.  I turned up 5 min prior to my booking time and as I approached I noticed a girl putting a sign in the window and locking the door   Fortunately she opened the door for me and I explained I was there for my session with Jenny.  She claimed no knowledge of the booking and Jenny hadn't come in that day.  They were busy for the next 30 min but if I cam back in half an hour they could fit me in.  Against my better judgement I agreed to this and left.

I returned at the agreed time to note the door was still locked and papasan was pacing up and down outside taking on the phone.  I was about to give it away and go and have dinner when the girl appeared and unlocked the door for me - papasan stayed outside talking on the phone. I paid my $ and was shown though to the same room as last time.  After the girl had left me to get undressed, I popped the bin lid and noted it was full of crumpled tissues   Maybe this time 

Anyway, clothes off, onto the table and in comes a different girl.  She has the strongest Kiwi accent I have ever encountered, very hard to understand hence my uncertainty re her name. I attempted to have a chat but got the cold shoulder with both attempts so gave up- Nora/Nola was not happy.

In summary, this was one of the worst massages I have experienced, it was uncomfortable, pressure in the wrong spots with no flow or rhythm. Worse, when I asked, Nola/Nora made it quite clear extras were not available   I felt like asking her to explain the tissue filled bin but thought better of it .

As I was leaving I encountered papasan.  Now papasan had been part of the discussion when I had booked Jenny the previous evening and I asked him what had happened to my booking.  We had a look and it wasn't on the booking sheet.  He then shrugged his shoulders and said Jenny had family problems today and didn't come in.  Yeah right 

Summary:

New shop with excellent fit-outNora/Nola is hopeless at massage and not recommendedI suggest someone is providing the T at this shop, I just haven't found them

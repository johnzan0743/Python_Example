My experience/comments : 

This place used to be Sahara, which had all variety of young backpacking hotties working here, although ridiculously overpriced. I visited once, but it was >3 months before I got around to writing a review, so I never did. Had some time recently in Brunswick up my sleeve, so thought it might be worth another crack. They changed names, and, it ends up, ownership. Now a strictly legit Thai massage place. All lof the things one expects ion a legit place; towels, eyes averted, etc. Very good hard Thai massage however, and even though I paid for 30 minutes it went for closer to 45. Mei has great English and enjoys a chat during the massage. I asked, and definitely no extras here.

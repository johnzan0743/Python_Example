Person's Name: Annie

Establishment : Royal Garden

Date of Visit: 12/3/11

Contact Details/Address/Weblink:http://www.royalgardenbodycare.com.au

Hours of Business: Monday-Sat

Rates: $60

Age: 35

Size/shape: Slightly above average weight

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services Provided: massage

Value for money/recommend?: No

My experience/comments: Went here as I was in need of a decent massage. The massage was ok enough but she was not very friendly and asked for a lot of extra money. I would not go back anytime soon.

To add a little bit more info for everyone. $60 was for half hour. The place was clean enough and has a decent ambience. However, the masseuse wasn't very attractive and whilst the massage itself was ok everything else was really rushed. Then without any build up she asks for $50 for a good finish. The mood was virtually zero and I declined. Maybe the place has better staff there than the one I was with. There were a few ppl there and maybe deserves another go. But I think I'd wait a while before heading out there again. Hope this helps!

 Royal Garden - Melbourne using the right template
				
Post Content: 
HI BAB trying again with the template:

Person's Name : Jasmine

Establishment : Royal Garden

Date of Visit : 24/11/11

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Melbourne, near queen and bourke

Hours of Business :

Rates : 45mins / 85

Age : Late 30's

Size/shape : Slightly larger lady, did not see breasts as clothes didn't come off.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage / R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Not unless I was feeling really randy. Massage was ordinary and service was mechanical

My experience/comments : I've been here before without any luck, but was feeling like it again so thought I'd try again. So I walked in paid, was given a room. I stripped down and got onto the massage table, in walks the massuese, and she didn't say anything this time about no underwear, so I took this as a good sign.

She asked whether I liked a hard or soft massage, I generally perfer hard so asked for that. However the massage itself was pretty poor wasn't hard at all, although she did start teasing all the right areas, wasn't long before it was time for the flip, by then blood had gone to the "other" head, she said it was $50 for the extras, which I thought was a bit steep (however it seems to be the going rate in the CBD), but it was too late by then. Soon enough I unloaded, she cleaned me up and finished up with more of a massage (more like a tickle).

Decided to give this place another try last month, because it was close to work. I actually went in wanting more of a massage then anything, so kept the jocks on and had the towel covering me. Massuese walks in and its an older lady 40ish, not much of a looker so, I thought I made the right choice, going for a straight massage. She starts to give me a massage (not hard enough in my opinion) on the back and shoulders, and by the time she works her way down to the bottom end she noticed my jocks are on, so she helps me out of them without asking, saying she didn't want to get oil on them. So I thought okay, lets see how this plays out. Moving along, theres slight brushes of the twins but not really anything to get me going. After a while I flip over and she asks whether I wanted a bit of "help", given it was average looks, I give a look of surprise and say no thank you. She takes this in her stride, but then proceeds to give the old fella a few more "brushes" until the once again the logical thinking goes out the window, so I ask how much and she says $50, I have a think and say no, so she bargains down to $30, I thought why the hell not. She then proceeds with the tug, I unload, get cleaned up and off I go.

I feel really sorry for you blokes in Melbourne... been reading the forums for an upcoming trip, and it seems $50 is the normal rate for a happy ending after a massage?
They're having a laugh, aren't they?
Seems like you can "bargain" them down to $30 if you're lucky!
$20 the normal price in Sydney - CBD, everywhere.
Might not partake whilst in Melbourne - sounds like the scene there is over-priced and under-delivering!

It's definitely overpriced, if you can get tug for $30 here in Melbourne stick to that place, few time girls asked $50+ at the end but I was persistent and they settled for $20-$30. Point is, those places sell sex and they are not registered for that,but they are charging sometime even more than legit shops.

Name: Serena
(Sometimes uses the name Candy)

Age: 28

Establishment: Royal Garden Bodycare
Two Locations.

1. 29 Johnson St, Reservoir 3073
9460 2148
2. 140 Queen St, Melbourne 3000
9642 4368

Visit: Thurs 25 Oct 2012 (Reservoir)

Hours: 10AM - 9PM

Rate: $60 - 30Min Massage

Size: 8 with C Cup.
(Def Implants)

Nationality: Chinese

Service: Handjob $50.

Value for Money: No

Comments:
The Reservoir place looks a bit run down. They had a few girls working that night, you don't get to choose and I guess it's like a lucky dip. You shower before and after your massage.

Serena did give a good deep tissue massage and knew what she was doing.

Towards the end of the massage she wasn't shy to ask if I wanted a "special massage". I asked how much she replied $50. I asked if she offered anything else but her rates were unbelievable ($150 for a headjob), I could have just gone to the brothels.

As I went there with $100, had $40 change from the massage.. Offered her $40 but she asked if I brought my wallet or if I had the extra $10 in the car to make up for the $50. 

I responded NO, but she still took the $40 and gave me the happy ending. She would let you touch her or offer more services but end of the day, it's all about the $$$

In conclusion i think it is overpriced for massage and happy ending. If you are from the northern suburbs, head to star therapy on high st northcote. $70 for 30min massage and happy ending.

PS: the owner of this massage palour is "may" a lady in her 40s. I believe she is the most experienced in terms of massage and from what Serena advised, she also offers happy ending.

Serena works Wed & Fri in the city and Thurs & Sat in Reservoir.

Ethan.

My experience/comments : I have been here several times. A little tricky to get in after 6 pm as the electronic doors are closed. Just tap on the window for a while and they come to get you.

I find the girls are better here as, although still Chinese, they generally speak better English then other places.


A little bit more expensive for both a massage ($60 for 30 mins) and also extras. They always seem obliging, I have never had to ask, they also always tell me to rollover and make it very clear. But they request $50 for a RnT. Reduced down though and did a great job of it.

Nice rooms, cleaner and tidier then others, so to me, the extra $$ are worth it.

There are heaps of places in melbourne where $70 will get you nude massage and tug. Some even as low as $60. I would never pay more than $70 for nude RnT and go on average twice a week. I cant understand anyone paying $50 extra for a tug in Melbourne

My experience/comments
Had to go to a Chiropractor in the CBD and had a nice lady Chiro who kept sticking her figures into the perimeter of my groin
Ha ha ,when finished ,I was feeling a bit of an itch caused by her , so wandered up Queen Street to this place.( no show with the Chiro).

I had been there a few years ago for an underwhelming experience but thought I would give it a go.
Place is well set up ,large waiting room,looks very legit.
Older Chinese mamasan on the desk.
She quotes me $100 for the hour which is a bit steep, so I take 45 mins for $80.for a quickie.
Enter the room which is all white,fluffy towels very clean and fresh 
I strip off and wait on the side of table in my jocks.
In comes a mid 30-40 Japanese lady dressed in a white sun dress,( slightly out of place in this environment).,black hair ,fringe over the eyes ,severe cut ( a bit Iike  a vilaness  in James Bond--ok if you are into bondage).
I drop the jocks and lie down,no attempt at all  to cover me by her.She starts on a soft and sensuous back massage.Feels very good.Slides her  hands straight away  sensuously over the bum.
Her conversation  is limited and a bit grumpy.
After a while the butt massage starts to slide down the crack and over the sack.We can see where this is going.Very soft nice hands ,pity about the temperament.
"Turn over please" .
She immediately says "what you want with this?" ,pointing down.No smiles ,very much a military operation.
I "what can you do and how much?"She gesticulated a HJ and on my query,no more .
Price? $50. "A bit steep for me"
"Can you do nude?" "Yes $100"
  "ha ha too much for me" .
angry snap reply "that is our price here,all the girls charge that and I not change any less". (Well that is pretty definite).
"Ok ,well let's stick to HJ for $50" (not happy).
She asks me to get up and get the money (WTF)( that puts me right off)
 .So we settle down for a HJ.
I want to see what I missed with the nude ,so I slide a hand over the clothed butt.She immediatlly steps away .
(Ok ,no going there.I might add I didn't miss much,the  waist high bloomers and a fairly MLF butt tells me what that would look like).
She is into it and I must say ,pretty good 
She gets me over the line with a steady and well practiced style 

.Overall  a good massage,very clean place but  a grumpy resentful lady  who you would not really want a repeat on.
Place itself is quite ok,prices are way  too high,and the extras not in the price market either  (if I can beleive her on the price policy)
Would I return? Well not in a hurry,but there are probably some nice gals out back

I'll write up a proper review but my recommendation is don't waste your money here. It's already $60 for a half hour massage and they want another $50 for a HJ.. I cracked the shits and got some of my massage money back, but you can spend better elsewhere.

They had to raise the base fee eventually, its been 40-50 for 20 years.  What is really worrying is the brothels, most reviews now, its just $ for this extra and $ for that extra.  The rnt scene has probably led to this, once brothel girls get wind of the extra's game, then we are cooked.

This place has been $60/30 for a long time, with expensive extras. If you manage to find a girl you can persuade to drop her prices (and her knickers) then you can get some good value here. I've not been for a long time, as the last decent girl I knew of working there left about a year ago.

Once I was in there, and who should pop up but Claire (ex M&J), claiming to be Korean and offered her M&J level of service for +$250. Um, no.

Services Provided : RnT n

Value for money/recommend? : overpriced 

My experience/comments: 
My previous experience here was if was far too expensive ,but very clean and a good quality massage .


I was feeling like a goood massage but with some action., in the city so called in here after a long break.

Called in late in the day and allocated 45 min with (I think name was ) Reanne.

. She was not bad looking in a milf way , flower sun dress .
Paid the gate fee and into a nice clean room ,stripped off and lay down .She comes in to pick up cover towel.Told her I don't need that.

She asks what kind of massage I want and I ask relax. 

She stars into a nice style massage then nuzzles my ear after a while to ask if all ok.So we know where we are going.

She gives me a very good quality back massage , a little brushing below here and there (not much).

On the flip., What would you like , pointing to junior ? $50 she quotes ,What else ? She indicates clothes off for $100 
I ask for BJ for that price "oh that would be $150 " LOL from me .
I explain prices around town for FS for $100 without the gate fee in some case.
She is not impressed "next time darling".

So off comes  the gear and she explains her HJ  is special."very Slow and long  time" and indeed it is.
A good quality enjoyable job.

In the process she allows full access and enters into some DFK .Not bad.

She has plenty of variety and also does a little encouraging dance like a stripper.as the clothes come off.

She does the job for me , clean up and I pay the fee on conclusion.

Not a bad punt but of course far to expensive .

Once before I argued the toss with reception on the Gate fee but all I got was "high rents in the city" , lmaybe so.
You don't get a lot here without paying a,lot to the girls.

There is more on offer from Renee if she is encouraged by $ and the price is right but to be frank whilst a very good massage ,she is after all a lady of not young age , so not sure whether she commands that but I would not knock her back for FS.if on offer.

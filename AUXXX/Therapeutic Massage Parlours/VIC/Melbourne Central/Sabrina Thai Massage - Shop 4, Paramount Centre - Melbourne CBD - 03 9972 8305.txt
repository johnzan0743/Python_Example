[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments :[/COLOR]
[COLOR=#333333]Have experienced this girl in Carlton before where she offered me FS a couple of times, she remembered me and was keen to get me in the door and naked.  Massage skills are reasonable and she's good with the personal hygene, although I think she's a bit noisy for such a public shop.  I was there an hour and she got me off twice, so $100 extra would be considered decent value.

Would I return? Maybe, she's a little odd and money hungry (aren't they all though) but gives a decent performance.

Massage started in the usual modified superman position (face down, arms above head, hands together) so she could let me have a feel while starting the massage on my head and shoulders. After about 3 minutes she leans down and whispers "what to you want?" and made a few hand gestures indicating what was on offer. FS was negotiated and she shuffled off to grab a wet-wipe and dom, a quick clean and she's up on the table 

I knew from previous times she's a bit noisy and she struggled to keep quiet until I was done. Clothes back on, out the door for wet towels and then back to continue the massage (there was still plenty of time left). She worked a few knots quite well until it was time to flip, she grabbed me and made a gesture for another round. Just a HJ this time thanks, her technique is pretty good.

Time's up, a quick peck on the cheek and she's gone.

Visited yesterday 27 December
Have been here 4 or 5 times and not bad for a pit stop
It is central,clean,and the staff are friendly and produce a good massage.
Yesterday saw Pearly(?)massage was staight(to my surprise) it may have been more to do with her perception of me , because I was tired and told her that,so no endeavor to do anything else
She is in her 20's chubby, good personality and does a good quality massage.
All the staff appear to be from Tiawan,fairly young and accommodating.
Those I have seen do HJ for $30 with a bit of a flash,of their uppers and a covered feel.clothes stay on
It is quite a good place and I suspect once you find the right girl more is available
I have seen Shirly ,who only works Sunday ,about 25 from Taiwan ,glasses and good accommodating massage, Annie, about 30- 35 ,nice looking and also worth a visit and Ci ci(?) good looking 30 ,very slim and sexy dresser.,good massage. All looked after me well

[/COLOR][/COLOR]
[COLOR=#333333][COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments : Decided to adventure in the city after a busy night, did some research on the BETTER massage centres in the CBD, I have heard about the Paramount before and decided to try it out.
Called the massage and Honey answered after a quick conversation she asked to make an appointment, just by luck no one was waiting however it was near the CBD lunch time rush.

Met Honey at reception, a very attractive Asian, tall about 5,9ish with very good figure, she suggested a 40min massage I agreed, she escorted me to the room, I noticed it was very clean and the walls rose to the ceiling and the door was able to lock. She told me to strip and lay on the bed while she attended to a phone call, as I heard part of the phone call something to conversation of offer TWIN massage.

When she returned to the room, I asked Honey about the "Twin" she said it was her Asian colleague with her massaging their "special" client...............however you may have to pay $$$$ which she didnt talk about in too detail as it was my first time here!

Honey started on my back with oil and very relaxing, she is very easy to talk to and has very good English.....

After about 15mins in a deep massage, she starts kissing my back all over, and whispers to roller over...
As I roll over, Honey starts to massage my legs and slowly moves up to my boys, mutually I start touching her inner thighs and can feel her tone legs, but she mentions that she is happy to strip for extra $$$$

She starts to slowly massage my area with oil and kissing my inner thighs, again she mentions that extra comes with extra $$$ and ask me to make an offer, I didnt want to get into a bidding match or offend 
and told her that I am happy for to continue.

Honey, know how to get me my fella to attention and hold till the end with a amazing R&T. After some small chit chat she quickly walked out of the room and returned with a cold bottle of water and a clean hot towel and continued to wiped me down from all the oil.

Will I return - it was fun and very curious to know about the "TWIN" option but maybe need a winning TATTS ticket[/COLOR][/COLOR]

As with all these places, it is better to negotiate up front for any extras. The rates are much better before you commit to stay.

The girls know that once they got you on the table, they got you by the balls (sometimes literally!).

Visited here and had a very pleasant hour with young cute Sonia (PRC 20 ish, slim, long hair, cute smile).
The place is very clean with crispy fresh towels, but the rooms are not very private with the walls not quite reaching the ceiling!
Anyway Sonia seemed very shy but the massage was great and she sorted out the knots in my back.
Post flip she worked up and down my legs brushing the boys a little under the towe,l then offered RnT for $50 - $30 was agreed and off she went.
For another 20 she lifted her top to reveal a nice rack but was reluctant to do anything else - this time.....
I reckon a few more trips and she will be more willing.
I will keep you posted.....

She introduced herself as Kim, she said shes Filo and usually works at St Kilda branch. Massage was alright, but the whole time she did her best to cover the important bit with towel. I don't know if I didn't get anything because I didn't ask but previously I was always offered.

My first rule of punting, always have a look at the girl first before agreeing to the transaction. You are buying a service, no different to buying anything else. If you don't like what you are buying, you don't buy.

If you don't like chubby, mid-30s Filipinos, walk or ask for someone else.

 Establishment : Paramount Health and Sauna Centre

 Date of Visit : 16/4/13

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Muscle therapy Melbourne

 Hours of Business : 11-11

 Rates : 1 hour $83 plus extras (further detail below)

 Age : Early 20s, I reckon 22

 Size/shape : 10

 Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC Im fairly certain
 Services Provided : Massage, HJ, Nude/Touching

 Value for money/recommend? : Very nice girl but not for the money involved!

 My experience/comments : So Im doing the rounds of the paramount centre, and I have heard a lot about this place so I thought id give it a try.  Straight up this place is bigger than Sabaydee also in the centre, and you get led through to the locker areas to change and then to a waiting room while you wait in your (awesome..not) robe haha.  So I think her name was Janie but fuck honestly I really think I heard her wrong, English wasn't top notch (3/10), but she started with a great massage.  one thing I had heard about this place is that they give great massages regardless of the outcome.  I had heard there had been trouble here in the past, so i was literally only going without wanting to push for anything more.  Im one of those guys that goes for the massages but if I get bonuses, beautiful.  So im on my stomach and getting extra special attention to my thigs/butt, and then she starts to gradually spread my cheeks a bit and her fingers brush over my butthole.  liking this, I opened up my legs just slightly and started getting a tickle of the boys, which felt amazing.  My balls were getting a good working over and then when I turned over when that time was done, and I was at full attention.  straight away she looked at me, not sure whether to proceed or not (it was my first time here so she was obviously cautious) but casually started with leg rubs gradually nudging my sack and pushing the towel away, at which point I was just lying there full bar, and her hands just ever so slightly grazed over my cock, and she said "extra??". when I enquired how much she said $50 I think that's fucking steep personally, but I managed to talk her into doing that nude for $50, which she did.  great tits, maybe a B, and pussy was nice and trimmed, not fully shaved, but manicured very well.  She allowed me to grab her ass tits, and circle her pussy but no penetration.  but she was wet!!  all in all she had a good touch and finished me off with a nice two handed HJ, but for that money im not entirely sure it was worth it.  would I return?? maybe if im in the area and need to get off, but there are probably better places you can get the same thing for less cash.

 Full Body Care Paramount Centre
				
Post Content: 
So today I will round out my tour of the Paramount centre with my review of Full Body Care:

Person's Name : Diana

Establishment : Full Body Care - Shop 19 Paramount Shopping Centre (enter little bourke)

Date of Visit : 17/4/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : FULL BODY CARE: Chinese massage therapy

Hours of Business : Open till late - 7 days a week

Rates : $45 for 45 minutes, plus extras (see below)

Age : Late 20's

Size/shape : 12? Chubby but by no means fat.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Either Thai or PRC, didnt ask.  Cute face though.

Services Provided : Massage, HJ, perineum massage

Value for money/recommend? : Good value, but better places elsewhere

My experience/comments:

So Full Body care wraps up the trio of places I am trying at the Paramount Centre.  I know there is a japanese place as well, but really ive heard that there is no chance of extras there so im not even including it.   might try that another time though. 

I initially thought this place wasn't as nice as the others, but still professional enough.  I was being massaged by a nice girl, she had a tight but chubby body, maybe b/c tits (good shape!!) and a cute bum. i like meatier girls so this was right up my alley. But at first i got the feeling nothing was on offer.  was very business, and the massage actually seemed professional (never a good sign for an rnt lol).  there was the usual butt massage etc but not even the slightest hint more might be on offer.

When the flip came, i was soft, but as she worked my thighs i started to bar up a bit.  She wasnt taken aback, just kept doing her thing...good news.  I didnt think she was going to suggest, so i flat out said  "i heard there are extras on offer here", she goes "some girls do this" and then i offered $50, which as i stated in my last review seems steep, but all the girls at the paramount places probably conspire to get similar stuff so i didnt think shed go for cheaper.  she said she would finish me off, but no nude, and no touching.  

That seems pedestrian, but her technique was good!  man handle the shaft and then delicately play with the knob, and then when i was about to blow, a nice solid perineum massage which sent me over the edge...after we were done i cleaned up, and she continued the ten or so we had left with the massage.  after that point she had gone from business to very smiley and giggly, so i guess all girls come out of their shells, even the shy ones!!!

Hey mate, i had Audrey the other day.  Interesting one.  I think she is super cute, and is a REALLY nice girl we had an awesome chat, and she does a good massage!! but im not sure anything else was on offer.....the only signal i got is that when i was on my stomach about 95% of the massage was on my arse, she literally just stayed there, and there wasnt really a tackle tickle although one or two times she did get a bit close to the crack.  also, when she came in and i was naked on the table she literally did noy flinch, she positioned the towel so my cheeks were showing but not my crack, but by the end of me being on my stomach the towel was pretty much off me and i was completey uncovered.  when i did the flip she put the towel over me and we started to have a good chat, but no real hint of anything else......would be interested to hear other guys experiences, id still like to see her a couple more times to see

You are "not sure anything else was on offer"? Mate, why didn't you just ask? The answer would be "yes, $xx" or "no"! Then you would have known and wouldn't have to go back to see.

Value for money/recommend? : It was ok, 6 or 7 out of 10

My experience/comments : April provided an ok massage, a little aimless at times but good pressure.  Spent a lot of time around the bum area, with a little TT to signal extra could be on offer.  After the flip negotiated 30 for some icing with the cake, did an ok job but somewhat mechanical.  Wipe down of the excessive oil at the end was good, but shortchanged by 5 min.

My experience/comments :  Good overall massage.  After the flip, discussion of extra's was hampered by Ivy's poor english.  Wanted 50 for HE, settled on 30.  Her technique was great!  Took her time, sensual touching including the starfish area.  After the wipe down gave an excellent head and shoulder massage.  Went 10 min over the 30 min slot.  Highly recommended.

 Sabaydee Massage - Melbourne CBD
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Honey
Establishment : Sabaybee Massage
Date of Visit : Fri 17 May, 2013
Address : Shop 4, Paramount Centre, Burke St Melbourne
Rates : Massage 30mins - $50 / Massage and R&T +$20 / Nude +$20 / Touching +$20
Age : Late 20's?
Size/shape : Dunno.....8?
Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian
Services Provided : Massage R&T (Clearly more if cough up)
Value for money/recommend? : Maybe. Massage was good, but added extras a bit cheeky.


My experience/comments : Did a quick research on places in the CBD and this place came up a few times.  On a whim I rolled in on Friday AM hoping someone was free.

Woman intero'd herself as Honey.  Hot azn, about 5ft 7ish, good English.  Asked for 45mins and she said okay.  Place is good.  Lockable door, good privacy.  She got phonecall and excused herself momentarily.  She came back and asked me to change and lie face down, then left again.

Came back after a couple of minutes, closed the door and started with the massage.  Pretty good for all intents and purposes, she's easy to chat to and has good English (Thanks fu$kin' god, getting sick of talking in Pigeon in these places!)

After about 15mins of good massage, she strangely starts kissing my back and whispers in my ear to roll over.

She starts off with the lower legs I can tell she's checking out the tackle and fairly quickly starts to give them a bit of a fondle. Can't help myself so I start rubbing the back of her legs which are AWESOME.  She says 'Strip for extra 20?' and of course I say 'sure'.

She strips off - GREAT BODY - and I cop a feel.  Panties on and no touching there, but everywhere else is fair game.  She oils up the tackle and goes to work, but starts kissing the general area and mentions we could do other things 'if the price is right'.  I can see myself getting real poor here so I say 'This is fine, let's stick with this' so she keeps on truckin'.

All in all it was pretty good.  She knows her way around downstairs, has good english and a killer bod.  Nuff said.

Will I return?  Mmmmmmmmyeah...it was pretty good.  List of options potentially a worry if you're not strong willed lol.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Paramount Centre L1 little bourke st, melbourne

http://www.sabaydeedayspa.com.au

Hours of Business : 10:00-22:00

Rates : $70/hr + 50 extras

Age : late 30s

Size/shape : average

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage/ R&T

Value for money/recommend? : poor

My experience/comments:

Saw the review of Sabaydee and went there for a try. Easy to find but not very popular, very small place. Paid 70 for an hour full body and was lead to a room with sarah. Sarah was nice looking chinese lady, about late 30s i think. I stripped and waited on the massage table. And after about 10 minutes, she finally came in. Her massage was okay, she said she's being doing it for 3 years. After 30 minutes, she gave a gentle tickle on the buttocks and I was asked to turn over. She told me about the extras and said 50 for a HJ, i tried to negotiate for 50 with stripping as well, i thought that would do it. She gave me some bullshit reasons and said need more money. She kept saying how dangerous it was and asking for more. And she told me about the extras first...  So after all i was sick and tired about arguing and just gave her 50 and she gave a quick HJ since theres only 15 minutes left. When i tried to touch her she turned away, so I just let her do the job and that was a very unhappy 'happy ending'. Then she walked out to clean herself and left me alone until the end.
Definitely will not go again, theres another older lady in that shop too. If anyone wants to try this place, definitely don't ask for Sarah, unless you really want a bad experience. Had a look in another massage place opposite to Sabaydee, unfortunately they only have old chinese ladies with very poor english.

Person's Name : Mini

Establishment : Sabaydee Massage

Date of Visit : 24/10/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 4A Paramount Centre Melbourne CBD

Hours of Business : 10am-9pm

Rates : $40 for 30 mins

Age : Mid 30s?

Size/shape : Petite girl, couldn't determine shape of body

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : Visited Sabaydee yesterday located on Bourke St floor of the Paramount Center in CBD. Shop is relatively smallish and 3 rooms side by side. Rooms are clean with heated under blanket but don't have roof so can hear clearly what the next door person is saying. Paid for 30mins at $40. Was shown into the room and asked to strip and lie on the massage table. In comes Mini, small petite Chinese ML with a ponytail. Face only 5/10. Proceeding to rub oil on my back and was actually quite skillful given her size. Plenty of firmness in her massage with skillful inter-connecting massage techniques. About 20 mins in, went out to get a wet towel to wipe off the oil on my back and asked to flip over. Upon the flip, immediately asked whether i wanted HJ for $30. Having read reviews from other websites, I bargained for $20 but was immediately rejected. I relented but she wouldn't accept $20 or even $25.

Because I was quite tired and her looks didn't really do it for me, I gave up and asked her to proceed with the massage. FInished up 30 mins into the session and she left the room. Good attitude on her behalf even after I rejected the HJ. 

Cheers

You rejected a HJ for the sake of saving $5?? I don't see the point; $30 is quite reasonable for the city and the south-east, which is where I operate. It's been a long time since I paid less than that.

Tackled this shop 4 or 5 times in the last month
Reason is they are starting to trade late
The advertise 9 pm closure but the Paramount Arcade locks off at 11 pm and they seem to be open when I have gone in at 10 or so and seem ok to run on till later after 11 if started earlier

Down side is anything above extra is not cheap

Saw Ivy.Gigi,Sonja,and Tina? 

Ivy is a neat package 
About 30 , slim ,from Tiawan . Dresses in revealing top and tight dress .Long hair and fairly attractive
Her massage is good quality
I took 1 hr for $70 
Her come on is alluring eyes. She looks at customer in long stares and whilst not speaking makes it very obvious wher she is going with the massage
She tackles the boys slowly from behind and on the flip the hands are there pretty soon
I asked for prices She started at $ 50 for HJ and negotiations lead to $ for N 
She wouldn't only go to topless nothing else on offer.
We agreed on $60  
I was keen to see what that revealed
Surprised to see she was no where near as big as she had appeared dressed ( initially it appeared she had no bra in, but it was one of those underneath push ups  A bit of deceptive advertising fellas )
I was not complaining though She let the hands run free all over although down below was not encouraged
Her show was quite a performance . Little spoken( her English is not good anyway) but lots of panting ,rolling of the eyes ,
Thrusting of the hips ( at the table) 
Pretty goods all round
I left happy 
Saw her again a few days later and same 
Over all I would recommend for a good performance ,but nothing on the wild side


Saw Gina 

Gina is a tall woman about 30 , I think also from Tiawan ( or maybe Hong Kong)
$70 for the hr plus extras
She is fairly forward ,talkative friendly
Massage was straight forward but good 
Started on the back ; a little brushing of the boys here and there 
On the flip negotiations led to $70 N  ( a bit of a bite)
They seem to have adopted a line of starting near the $50 mark and adding from ther
N was not N
Dropped the pants to the knees and pulled up the top and bra down . I objected but just got a benign smile , pointing to the door with no lock
She has a nice set and let the hands run free but positioned herself to restrict to much lower contact
Got me over the line
Good massage so suppose one could not complain 
I would not be looking to chase her up again ! But ok for a punt
Reasonable looks and figure ,and pleasant to deal with.

Saw Gina 

Shw is about 28 to 30 
Tall slim nice looking
$70 for the hr plus extras
$50 for topless 
Nice set  nice performance 
Nothing out of the ordinary
Took her time and made sure I left happy
Would I return ? Yes ok for a late relaxer 

Saw Tina? I may have the name wrong
Slim little girl,from Tiawan About 24 I guess.
Started off with no hint of extras
A really good massage 
On the flip ,and perhaps too late she is massaging and keeping a towel positioned. In a v over the vitals
She is very serious going at the massage  with dedication
I finally pop the question .)her whole demeanor change . Face lights up with delight 
Her English is not good
She holds up five fingers
Who am I to argue at this point
She goes at it with great enthusiasm . A little to,fast for my liking
It is near time. I ask to extend for half hour and agree $30',for the boss and relax back
Nothing else is discussed or appears to be on offer so I just enjoy the process
Pretty good job over all

As said the price here is an issue and the side benefits are a bit limited on my experience to date
The late night is great for me .
The place is very clean but no showere ( hot towel) 
Staff is good quality overall

Value for money/recommend? : Yes
My experience/comments : 

I left work early one afternoon and was wandering through the city on my way to meet up with a few people for drinks. Either I arrive at my destination a good 1 1/2hrs earlier than them all and start drinking, or, I pass the time with a massage and R&T to relieve my stress from the week just gone?

I chose the later.

Having never tried any massages places I thought I'd see what was inside Paramount, largely because anything I did find would be off the main drag and in my mind likely to be worthwhile.

It's a small pokey joint with about half a dozen 'rooms' on the right side of the space. The rooms have full doors w/lock but the walls do not hit the ceiling. How hush hush the girls seem to be here is why I could not make out for the life of me the womans name. Anyway, I wandered in and there was no one in sight then suddenly a woman appears, mid to late 30's and asks if I'm after a massage.

"Yes, 30mins - who do you have?"

Hoping to see more than just her simply because I wanted options. "In here" she says as she points to an open door to the right. Eh, fuck it. I wander in and hand over the cash and get ready.

Not a bad massage, but not an awesome one. I did ask her to work a bit more on my shoulders which she obliged and it was decent. "Extra?" she whispers to me. "Yes, hand or ... ?" I query. She motions with hand only. Oh well. I agree and hand over the extra cash and lay back down on the table. "Face forward" she says, and continues 'massaging' around my inner thighs and brushing my balls. She leans into me and says "I start from behind first, then you turn over"

Ok! I think, something different. She gets some baby oil and I raise my hips a bit to get her better access and she begins stroking my cock and gently caressing my balls. After a few minutes of this I am fukn well hard and I turn over. She had quite a way with her hands.

As she is stroking with perfect rhythm and playing with my balls I motion to touch her, "$10 extra nude", I shake my head and she continues. Not only did she have perfect rhythm but was rubbing my perineum also. She changed positions but not often. Just as you were getting into it and potentially at the edge she'd change up.

After a good 10mins or so I explode everywhere. She seemed to enjoy it. Hot towel to clean it all up and I was on my way to work drinks.

Next time I go if get her I will actually get her name, otherwise I hope to try some of the other girls. I hadn't seen any, but did hear them talking whilst I was in my session.

My only hesitation is the lack of 100% privacy. I and the lady tend to relax more when there is no one in earshot at all ...

My experience/comments :

Thought I'd give this place another go and was in need for a massage at any rate.

I wandered in and the gentlemen in the front asked me what I was after, '30min massage, who do you have on?'. 'Been here before?'. Yes. I was lead into a room, I find that some places never answer the question or want to give you an option. They may need to know me better. Who knows ...

I spotted to girls on my way to the room, a young looking Korean girl and Mia who took my massage, a late 20's Taiwanese girl.

Mia gave a decent massage, had been doing so for about 2 years she said and claimed she needed to learn a lot more. Never sure how to take some of this information but the delivery seemed honest enough. After about 20mins of massage I turned over and she whispered into my ear 'special massage?'. I nodded and handed over $50 which was the rate I could get her to budge on.

The convenience of the city is probably what is allowing this place to charge what they do. Yes I get a HJ and a massage but I wouldn't mind them 'spicing it up' a bit and making a service that both parties are into. Feels a bit mechanical otherwise. Didn't object to touching vera

HJ was decent enough, she played with my balls in stages which kept be at the edge for a while. Job done, clean up and the remaining few minutes a strong shoulder massage to finish.

Had an hour to kill so thought I'd try sabaydee Thai massage in the paramount. Was ushered into the toon where I met April. She's quite slim but with a descent pair and average face, nothing to write home about. After the clothes came off and I put the towel around me, she re-entered the room and the massage began. Massage was okay but not great, after a few attempts to brush her leg she got the hint and ripped the towel off and started massaging closer to my boys. She never actually touched them but on the flip I pointed to Larry and she asked how much? I said $30 and she said okay. HJ was okay, no touching under clothes allowed but she was quite pleasant  throughout always smiling. Anyway, I finished up and she came back with a hot towel and cleaned me up. She funnily enough gave me the tissues to dispose of outside which I always find funny. Lol Anyway WIR - probably as it's convenient and a good cheap RnT, although I'd prob choose one of the other girls, I think Loulou is my pick at this place.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :  First went to Lotus Day Spa but I couldn't crack it for a T there (again) so headed over to Paramount. Was surprised that most places in there were still open. Walked past FBC but the lady behind the desk looked about 60 so I kept on going around to Sabaydee. Lady sitting on the step opposite playing with her phone yelled out to someone inside as I went through the door. A few seconds later out popped Kim and showed me into the front room. Now I have been to this place before some time ago and the front room was then the reception. Reception has obviously been moved to the steps outside the shop to squeeze in an extra massage table. Good to see business booming in the massage world at least.

Kim left me to strip off, not easy in the confined space but I managed all the same. Her first touch was a light stroke on the bum and I knew all would be good! She gave an okay massage for about 10 minutes and I then let her know I was impatient by giving her leg a bit of a squeeze. SHe asked if I wanted special massage and I said yes and held up 3 fingers which was accepted. I'd heard things were getting pricey here so was surprised she took the $30. She asked me to hand over the cash straight away which is a bit of a pet hate of mine but she was a fun girl and I was horny so it didn't slow things down too much. Once the cash was handed over she was quick to get down to business. I tried to engage her in a bit of mutual fondling while she was jerking me off but she kept asking me to lie down and kept her distance from wandering hands. Maybe a higher price is asked for more play.  

Kim is an attractive girl. A bit bigger build than most Asian girls but not in an off-putting way. I think she could be a lot of fun after a few visits and will try her again soon.

Establishment : Sabaydee Massage

Date of Visit : 02/03/14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 4A Paramount Centre Melbourne CBD

Hours of Business : 10am - 11pm (I think)

Rates : $70/hr + extras

Age : Mid 30's?

Size/shape : Petite, slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Massage, HJ, 

Value for money/recommend? : yes and no

My experience/comments : 

I have been looking for AMPs that are open late in Melbourne around the CBD and thought I'd give Sabaydee a try. Dropped in at around 9pm and was met by Sonia, a petite lady from PRC, who was nothing special, but certainly not unattractive. After sorting out $70 for the hour I was taken to a small room. As others have said, rooms are tiny, and while the doors have locks, the walls are just partitions and you can clearly hear what is going on next door.

Sonia gave one of the best massages I have had lately. So good I nearly fell asleep, and before I knew it I was being asked to turn over. Massage continued with legs/arms/head/stomach and no offer of extras until time was nearly up. I was enjoying the massage so much I wasn't even going to ask.

Turns out I didn't need to ask as Sonia put her hand on my dick, leant down and whispered did I want a special massage?

I asked how much, and she replied with how much did I want to pay. I offered $30, she said more. $40, she said more. Settled on $50, and requested I pay now. I'm really not particularly good with haggling over the price of a HJ. Last thing I want to do is piss the lady off and get terrible service. It was also pretty hard to communicate as everything had to be said in whispers due to the lack of privacy.

I asked about getting her naked, to which she replied no. She would show me her tits and allow me to touch another $50. No touching anywhere else. I declined.

She started with a pretty good HJ, using a decent amount of oil and alternating hands , and after a while leant down and whispered in my ear that I have a "beautiful penis". Hadn't heard that one before half way through the HJ.

After around 10 mins or so she got me over the line. Cleaned me up with tissues which I got to take with me in a little plastic bag (wtf?). A bit more of a back massage and a few stretches and I was on my way.

WIR? Not sure. Probably not. Although the massage was excellent, lack of privacy and no shower means this place is pretty much off the list for me. 

Still looking for either a PML or AMP in the CBD + a couple of kms that I can get a 1 hour massage at 9pm or later, with the likelihood of more extras than just a HJ. If anyone can give me a recommendation that would be great!

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Paramount Centre Bourke Street Melbourne

Hours of Business : 10am - late

Rates : $50 for 30 minutes + $100 for Nude

Age : 20's

Size/shape : Slim, traces of alot of weight lost maybe?

Nationality or Ethnicity : HK

Services Provided : RNT

Value for money/recommend? : Reasonable and good at tug, but so are many others

My experience/comments : Have seen Ivy a few times now, and each time she seems to grow more comfortable with offering more each time. Her massage skills are really not that good, its just lights touches all over and teases around the crack so you know straight away that more is on offer. When it comes times to flip she will place the towel over and just slowly move her hands closer and closer untill you make eye contact and then she will ask, what u want baby? i say full nude and she wants 100 for that...upfront also. I say im ok thanks anyway but 150 all up is very expensive. She looks like she has a nice body but it aint worth 100 even if i had the money on me. Also this place has no walls so you have to be really quite with i hate! Overall she is ok and her HJ will get you over the line but im done with the "over the line" type service if im gonna pay 150 all up it better be something good with a hottie. She wants 50 for HJ, but can be brought down of you say "all i have is 30 or 40" she will take it. 

So overall its not really worth going back here. But i will say if you rock up with cash to burn lets say 200 she would prob go FS, but then you could prob get much better elsewhere for the same price so its really up to you. good luck!

I ventured in here on Friday night after April for an hour massage - unfortunately she wasn't working so I gave Ivy a shot. When I asked for naked she asked me how much, I thought I'd go low ball and with a cheeky look said $20! Let's just say she didn't find the humour in it and said she'd only give me a HJ. I offered an extra $40 for naked but she said all I'd be getting today was a HJ. In the end, I have her $40 for the HJ. Still a decent punt, she gets into it, plenty of ball play, dirty looks, and a bit of ass play. I still prefer April, but I'd also see Ivy again.

the min i got ivy to for naked HJ was 80, then she went up to 100 the time i went after and she did not cave for anything less.  Id say she has enough dudes paying it but as she is booked pretty often at this store and the one in Balwyn. The shop in Balwyn is much better anyway as they have proper small rooms that are private (well more private than the city shop anyway)

If you are just after HJ u can bargin with her, but not for anything else she might offer

My experience/comments :
Strictly a TOFTT review here. Tried it out after seeing the name of the place. I figure any place with the word "Happy" in the title would have to be a sure thing. I know others have had extras offered here but it didn't happen for me. The girl I got spoke very little English. I don't mind broken English, but it was virtually impossible to communicate with her. The walls in the place are also extremely thin. There was a bloke in the next room and I could hear every single work of his conversation throughout. I said "Thin walls huh". She replies "I don't know". Then later she disappeared for about 2 minutes. When she came back I said "You ok?". She then said "you ok?". I said "yes, are you ok?" she said "You ok?". It would have been funny if my balls weren't blue. The massage was ok, she avoided the zone. I didn't even bother trying to ask for anything. Went immediately afterwards to another 'sure thing' place down the road. So much for trying something new.

Value for money/recommend? : Definitely. One of the best I've been to. 

My experience/comments :

Working my way through Melbourne. Wanted to try this one and the one opposite at the Paramount. Wandered in and a cute girl walked out and asked if I wanted a massage. Yes please 30 mins. Money changed hands and I was shown into the room to change.

The girl walked in shortly after.  Her name was Ivy. Quite cute. Started the massage and asked how hard etc. Worked her way around my back and arms in a good methodical way. Not like the all over the place stuff you get at some places. After about 10 minutes the massage moved to my arse and stayed there for the next 10 minutes, moving pretty much everywhere around there. Finally the hot towell came out and she gave the back a good clean before the flip. 

Started working on my chest and stomach then, with a trailing hand always around the crackers. Then she says something I didn't understand,  but assumed was the 'wanna tug?'. I nodded and asked how much. She asked for $50 and since she was cute I thought I'd try and get her to take her gear off rather than haggle. I asked if she could take off her top but must have said it too loud,  she freaked a little! No no,  not allowed shhhhh.. Then I said ok no probs, sorry,  and offered $30 for the rest.

She then locks the door and gives me one of the best tugs I've ever had. Slow, one hand on the arse as she went and only picked up the pace right at the end. Fan bloody tactic.

Oh and the clean up was great. Normally I wouldn't comment but she was amazing. Great clean, went over everywhere a few times and I walked out without feeling like I just bathed in oil.

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Massage, HJ, topless

Value for money/recommend? : Tough one (see review)

My experience/comments : 

I had 30 minutes to spare, so decided to take a punt in here. Attractive PRC ushers me in, $40 for 30 mins. I give her $50, asked to undress, and she will be back soon. Gigi came in and for 10-15 minutes gave a really good hard massage. This then switched to a delightfully teasing massage. After a few minutes of this, she bent down and whispered, "Are you horny?" a few times as she was stroking me, then asked me to turn over.

The answer to the question was yes; I was at full mast.

She leans down and whispers to me, "I can do more." A bit of whispering and we get to the nub: nude HJ for $300. WTF!?!?! No fucking way! "Ah, baby, I have great nipples." No, certainly not for $300, they could be made of gold and mine to keep but not for $300.* "OK, baby. You very desirable. $200." Um, no. All the while she's doing this amazing stroking thing. In the end, I get a topless HJ for $70 (actually $80 if you consider I had not got my change).

So.

She does have amazing nipples. Extremely nice. Her tits are excellent as well. Her stomach is amazing -- completely ripped abs. This chick seriously works out.

Her HJ is incredible. Credit where it is due, it is very very good. One of the best I have ever had.

WIR? Dunno. It's not cheap, but once you get there, the quality is great, from the legit massage at the start, through the visual show, to the ending.

Gigi works there Friday - Tuesday.

* Although I may be able to melt them down and get my $300 back I suppose.

My experience/comments :

I hadn't been to Sabadydee for quite a while so decided to swing past as I was in the area. It had been so long in fact I didn't recall any of the girls from here so on here I jumped to quickly get a run down. Ivy had a good review and lucky for me she had been working.

She is quite attractive in my eyes and those breasts!

If only I could get them out ... I've actually seen Ivy 3 times since this session, still no further on that front I'm afraid.

Anyway, led to a room, leave some cash on the table and starkers I become. Not so much of a massage which is not unusual. Excellent teasing. She leans forward after a short while, "would you like special" she whispers.

"Hmmm ... maybe, what do you like to do?"
"Hand, $50"
"Is that all?"
"How much you want to pay?"
"$50, nude, HJ"

She shakes her head and waves here finger at me.

"Ok, $30 HJ" she shakes her head again.

By this time I've flipped and my hard on is going down. Determined not to pay $50 for a clothed HJ I let her keep pretending to massage my front. Within 20 secs I get an "OK, $30".

I prompt her to lean forward and suggest that she can have her $50 for top off. She shakes her again and I shrug. Fortunately this does not kill the mood and her HJ along with the anal play is quite fukn good.

I explode everywhere and she does a brilliant job of cleaning me up.

I'd like to know if she works anywhere else. The walls of this place don't go up to the ceiling and she has suggested that it is "not safe for nude" a couple of times. I try each time I see her though

My experience/comments : 

Dropped in on spec, and Gig was the only person available. Really, it was almost a repeat performance of my previous session in November (see review above). Wanted the extra $300 for the HJ clothed. Presumably someone somewhere pays this, or else she's doing some psychological tricks using anchor points to get a higher payment. As per last time, it was an extra $70 for a semi-nude HJ. Stomach was still washboard hard, nipples and tits really nice, and I got a bit of a play with kitty this time.

Her HJ though -- I've worked out what it is. It's the eye contact. Her technique is great, but combine that with the eye contact -- there is no feeling that she does not want to be there. Quite amazing, and it's a simple trick that I wish other MLs would use -- makes the world of difference.

I could do without the ridiculous high pricing BS at the start, but it was a good session. YMMV, so I'm not calling out a recommendation one way or the other here. It's probably worth a shot with Gigi once to see how you like it, but the recommendation is not unconditional.

My experience/comments :

Dropped in at lunch time, welcome by a cute asian girl Vivian. She's pretty hot and apparently she only works on Wednesdays here. 
After a nice thai style massage, I asked about extra. She said 50 but I said normally it's 30, then she indicated that she could take off the top, deal. She stripped right away, I was surprised that for a slim body like hers, she's got some really big and good looking boobs, enhanced I reckon. Anyway, the extra was rather mechanical, she was not really into it, and she didn't enjoy being touch either so only good to look at. 
In conclusion, nice girl, good body, average service. Damage was 90 for 30 minutes.

This seems a big change from the usual routine here Snapper.
 I have been here maybe a dozen times usually as a late night pit stop because they close about 11 pm when the arcade shuts off.
Most I have ever got is topless HJ and by topless here they mean just lifting the top,not all off ,which is a waste of time.
There are also one or two who argue the toss about that "don't do that" or who want $100 for "topless" HJ
The girls here are mainly from Taiwan,and stick to a routine and HJ standard charge .They try for $60 for HJ inthe first instance .
Maybe your Korean girl is breaking the mould .Do you know her name.
Query whether any of our other punters have had a BBBJ here?

Snapper, rereading your post, imaybee it is not Sabaydee that you refer to where this post is placed (Sabaydee does not have a shower and sauna) but Paramount upstairs?
Different place Admin ?
Need to move it to Paramount perhaps?

Person's Name : Linda
Establishment : Sabadydee, Paramount Centre Bourke Street Melbourne
Date of Visit : January '16
Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Paramount Centre Bourke Street Melbourne
Hours of Business : 10am - late
Rates : $40 for 30 minutes
Age : Late 30's to early 40's
Size/shape : Slim, B cup.
Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese
Services Provided : RNT
Value for money/recommend? : No, it was nothing special

I was in the area and had remembered that was some confusion about venues here recently, I didn't recall any of the reviews at the time and was not in a position to check.

Figured I'd try it out again as it had been a while since I'd been back, the last time was Ivy & Gigi.

Walked in and only Linda was available, nice lady, she said that there were three or four other girls on. I couldn't get names of any of the other girls so I've no idea who works here any more. Opted for the 30min massage and got myself ready.

I did ask for little to no oil and directed Linda to only work on my lower half. The oil sticks a lot and I'm not a fan of being able to smell it through my shirt. She obliged, the massage was light and did not start out suggestive at all. As she would move her hands anywhere near any region of erogenous zone for me I would make suggestive movements and sounds.

Nothing special.

After about 10mins of this she started getting a lot closer to the boys and asked me if I was happy, I replied with I am about to be and smiled. $30 she quoted. Not bad! So away we went. She was very happy to accommodate but it all felt a little but too generic for me. She almost seemed nervous. Once I flipped over I had to direct her a lot for what I was enjoying. I'm not a fan of having girls grab or suck on my nipples, seems some ML start that immediately. Once it was clear that I was well on my way she placed a paper towel on my stomach and chest to 'catch' anything.

That made things feel a little clinical and it wasn't until the job was done and I was dressed (she did up my top) and went to walk out did I understand what it was for. The used paper towel that had me all over it and was used to clean me up was now rolled up and handed to me. I could not exit the premise without that in my hands.

Oh, and a business card with her working days written on it.

Unless anyone has reports of who else is working here I'm not sure I'll go back if I'm ever in the area again.

Date of Visit : 2/5/18

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 
Shop 4, Paramount Centre - Melbourne CBD - 03 9972 8305

Hours of Business : 10am - 9pm

Rates : $40 -30 mins + $50 clothed hj

Age : 26

Size/shape : 8-10

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage, clothed Hj.

Value for money/recommend? : 

My experience/comments : 

Wanted to try other girls, had a look at a few shops in Victoria St, but found no one suitable. Both bus replacements & a lack of funds were limiting my options, so ended up booking Vivian, as her main good point is that she's a looker. Not exactly the service with a smile, cheerful & chatty type if that's your thing.

Strip down nude & put a pineapple next to the oil bottle. 
IME bartering for a basic HJ here is futile, Vivian especially. 
Strong massage isn't her forte, so opt for relaxation. 

When massaging my back, clothed touching is limited, but allows more access when she massages my legs, focusing more & more on my nether regions. On the flip I manage to get my hand down her top & inside her bra while she berries me off to completion. Though I suspect I was allowed tittie access because I've paid the going rate for topless or bodyslide with her in the past.

Can't say I'd recommend her, but would return purely for her looks

Person's Name : Lin

Establishment : Not, sure, hoping I have the right thread. It's in the paramount centre, on the left as you enter from Bourke St Go past the picture framing shop, wheel to the left, there's a legit Chinese medicine place, then this one. It's not the upstairs sauna place, and not Pings.

Date of Visit : September 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Paramount Centre

Phone : Unsure

Hours of Business : 10-8

Rates : $45/30 mins + extras

Age : 30s of 40s

Size/shape : Strapping lass with a decent set of funbags

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Nude HJ, DATY, LFK

Value for money/recommend? : Yeah

My experience/comments : 

Dropped in here to see a Nancy on the recommendation of someone. Nancy not there, but Lin was available. She came out from the back room, her tits pushing a path down the corridor. Dressed in fishnets as well. Yes please.

Into the room, some decent hard massage for 15 minutes, then switch to soft, then the flip. Whispered negotiation saw me get nude + DATY for +$80. As is often the case with MILFy types, tasted great. She certainly enjoyed the licking out, took some time to recover, and then gave a very very good HJ. Here is a lady who is no stranger to this...

Not sure which days she works (or even if I have the right shop), but I would go back for a second round.

Cl-Dean you've got the right place. Many just refer to it as the "Purple Place" to avoid confusion. 

Actually heard that they had a change in management with different girls here. Anyone seen or heard from Vivian I reviewed above?

Person's Name : Lin

Establishment : Sabadydee, Paramount Centre Bourke Street Melbourne

Date of Visit : early Feb 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : as above

Phone : as above

Hours of Business : not sure

Rates : $40 for 30 minutes

Age : 40's

Size/shape : Medium height, ok looking, B-C cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Clothed HJ

Value for money/recommend? : The massage at $40 for 30 minutes is good value. Lin has a nice flowing style. The CHJ at $50 with min. touching is too expensive, although it seems to be the new price that is being asked everywhere, as Lin said to me in the negotiations.

My experience/comments : Very narrow shopfront so easy to miss. Was put in the room at the very front. The room is the smallest I have ever been in. Good massage with a bit of a tickle followed by the negotiation at about 20 min mark. One odd thing happened, about 5-10 min there was a pause in the massage followed by what sounded like Lin carefully wiping her hands on a towel. Massage continued but only with one hand, I was face down, then heard the camera noise of a photo being taken. I didn't look up as there are no particular identifying marks on my back if the photo ended up in one of their ad's or something. At the end of the massage I looked to see if Lin had a phone and she did have a small flat purse that could of contained the phone. Lin wouldn't budge on the $50 saying that it is the same price everywhere and that touching is ok. Turns out that touching didn't include the pussy but did include the tits with erect nipples. Great HJ technique with one hand playing with the sack and date and the other light and slow.

Mods,

This shop has changed its name to Sabrina Thai Massage. All other details remain the same.

It's a Thai massage shop which appears to be exclusively staffed by Chinese ladies...

Person's Name : Mia

Establishment : Sabrina Thai Massage

Date of Visit : early May 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 4A/180 Bourke St (Paramount Centre)

Phone : As above

Hours of Business : early 'til late, says Mia

Rates : $40/30mins

Age : early 20s

Size/shape : solid

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Massage, NHJ

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : 

Passing through and decided to see who was available. This pretty young thing emerged, showing a decent bust and nice solid legs. Half an hour, $40, why not.

Was shown through to a room in the other half of the shop, where the door promptly failed. The mamasan, which looks as though she spends her entire life sucking on lemons, tried to fix it, ended up grumpily moving me to another room. Got in, undressed, lay down, in came Mia, and started a reasonably competent massage. Good chat, seemed like a nice enough kid. Some exploring with my hands showed that toughing knees and below was fine, and a quick expedition up higher revealed, that no, she wasn't going to have anything to do with that (*slap*) and she was wearing some *very* skimpy underwear.

Come the flip, and negotiations began. Started asking for $50 for a CHJ. I countered with $50 for a NHJ. That's $80, she says, I'll do $60, I say. No, $80 she says. Just keep massaging I say. She sulks for a bit, and does some hand wafting. OK, $60. Off comes her dress to reveal the aforementioned skimpy panties, and from the back a massive bra. It had either 4 or 5 clips on it, usually a sign of bountiful things to come. Instead, what was revealed was a very disappointing set of B cups (on a good day). Her body was thick and solid, as was her arse.

HJ was woeful. Very limited touching allowed. 

WIR? Not for Mia. Massage was OK, but if you're after just a straight massage, I can get one several times better for $50, so why bother. Extras not worth it.

Dean.

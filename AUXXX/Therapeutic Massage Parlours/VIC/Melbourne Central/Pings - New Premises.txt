My experience/comments : 
I will keep this one short. This is obviously a sleazy joint. Sometimes I love sleazy.


I Paid $30 for a half hour massage.


I am assigned Yu Yu. She is a reasonably presented Chinese  ML. She has certainly been around the block, and more than once.


So onto to the table & Yu Yu starts a vigorous back massage. Therapeutically excellent. 


When we get down to tin tacks she tries to score $100. for a clothed handy. This is an insult to my intelligence.


She immediately drops it back to $30., but insisted on so many Ts & Cs, that my dick was getting limper by the minute.


I chose to have nothing more than a massage. She was not impressed. Too bad.

Hey Panch. Those damn Ts and Cs. I've got a hint for you. Take your contracts lawyer with you, book a 4- hander. He can negotiate you a performance based contract with excellent conditions and liquidated damages provisions, in exchange for a modicum of attention from your second lady once your contractual requirements are fulfilled. You probably still come out ahead.

Person's Name : Lisa
Establishment : Pings Massage - new shop

Date of Visit : November 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 241(or close to it) Victoria Street Abbotsford Victoria.
It is on the north side of the street, between Hoddle St & the rail overhead bridge.
Phone : Not advertised.

Hours of Business : 10am to 11pm sometimes later.

Rates : 60$ total

Age : 50ish

Size/shape : slim but old and saggy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : not at all

My experience/comments :
why do we do the things we do.... should of walked straight away when the smell of smoke reeked through the building.
lisa put me into the room and i knew i should of walked. 
Anyway she comes back and starts to grind on me while im getting changed soon all of our cloths are off and the dirty talk begins. 
The problem is apart from the talk about how good she is nothing is really happening. she gets me to lay down and starts stroking little bone and telling me how lucky i am to see her naked... this goes on and eventually i take over and finish up. She offers a massage to make up for the time but i decline and leave..
WIR not a chance as there is better value in the area.

Person's Name : Anna
Establishment : Pings Massage - new shop

Date of Visit : Feb 2020

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 241(or close to it) Victoria Street Abbotsford Victoria.
It is on the north side of the street, between Hoddle St & the rail overhead bridge.
Phone : Not advertised.

Hours of Business : 10am to 11pm sometimes later.

Rates : $50 for 60 mins + $30 for HJ

Age : 50+

Size/shape : fit but old

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : Can't complain about bang for bucks

My experience/comments :
new shop of Good ol' pings. They now have 2nd floor setup and still with very thin curtain, WHY?
Perhaps it attracts people with certain fetish..

Anyway, Anna seems like a FOB from China, speaks fairly limited english only. 
Massage was OK, 3/5 and at about 30 minutes mark she gave me the usual HJ sign and indicated it's $30. Sure, typical Victoria st. price.
Then she started very slow and nice HJ, asked my permission to rub my date and it was going for 10 minute or so.
When it getting close to the finish line, I asked her to shove down some fingers into my hole and she happily obliged and did some prostate works as well.
Overall, it wasn't too bad. Can't really complain for $80/h HJ inclusive price.

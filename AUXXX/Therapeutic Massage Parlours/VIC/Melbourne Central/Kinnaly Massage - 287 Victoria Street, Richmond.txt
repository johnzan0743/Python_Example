My experience/comments : 
Had an awesome haircut and massage experience up the street, left me wanting more. Checked out a couple of p;aces along the drag, but wasn't in the mood for an old boiler. Dropped into Kinnaly and there was a pretty young Thai girl, bit round, but wrinkle free. OK, let's TOFTT.
30 minutes for first dip.
Clean, pleasant, some rooms decked out with futon on floor, others had raised table.
In I go to a table room, good sign, and I notice it's hydraulic: raises, lowers, tilts. Could be interesting.
Strip off, lay down.
Amy comes in and places a towel over the vitals.
30 minutes of terrific massage follows.
I pick up she's young and shy, so I enjoy a good session.
Towards the end I gently asked if there was anything else and was given a firm shake of the head.
Never mind.
Absolutely enjoyed the session for what it was.
Other girls here may be different, but I doubt Amy would be corruptible.
So no action here, just intel.
That's why it's a punt.

 Tiffany's - Is it the same one?
				
Post Content: 
Years ago I used to visit Tiffany's quite reguarly. Great value, great service, then Annie went overseas and it moved and went to junk. I heard that Annie had returned, but never made it back. Today I decided to see if she still advertised, so googled it. I was suprised to find a news article saying that she had been busted and arrested in July 2013, but I also found recent ads.
Is it the same Tiffany's? Or someone trying to use her infamous name?

I saw that post as well and it wouldn't surprise me if she has re-opened.She would probably not advertise,just stick with her old regulars and she wouldn't move away from the CBD as she has a raging addiction to the casino that needs regular feeding.

I was a long time very regular up until about a year ago when she shafted me for the last time.I recall reading somewhere (maybe on here) that she told someone that the police confiscated all her phones yet this particular punter was still able to stay in contact with her.I haven't been able to find out whether she actually went to court either.

i read on a rival site, she is "paying the price" for her exploits even though the member reported she was operating again.

I could find nothing on the net about any court case,only the original reports from when she got busted.Usually the papers love that sort of thing so I can't imagine them all missing it.

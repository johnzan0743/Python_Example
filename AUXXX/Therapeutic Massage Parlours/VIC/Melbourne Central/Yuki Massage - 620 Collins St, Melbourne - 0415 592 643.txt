yeah, this place is a total ripoff. 65-70 bucks for a 30min rnt and the experience is totally not worth it. i've been with all their girls, and all of them are shit at service.. esp Jojo and another cute-looking bespectacled thinny (dont go by looks)

Ye you blokes are right

Went in last week saw girl named salena or sarena got all our gear off and looked good and thought I was gonna have a great time. 

Until the massage began, I could have reached over and given myself a better rub on my back. Any way turned over to get down to business and hand on cock and start slapping away. Once again I could have done this myself for the $60 I paid.

Will not be going back their again

Any update on this location? Been a while since I visited - any new blood, or still very average service?

 Yuki Massage
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Monica

Establishment : Yuki Massage

Date of Visit : Early October (can't remember exact date)

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 620 Collins St

Hours of Business : 11am – 8pm ?

Rates : $70 for 30 mins

Age : 20-25

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage & Tug. No other services offered.

Value for money/recommend? : Not bad, but nothing special.

My experience/comments : Monica is slim, quite pretty and quite young (although I’m a bad judge of age, especially with asian women). Not very talkative but not rude/stand-offish either.

Shown into the room I undressed and lay face down on the massage table. When she re-entered the room she started with an okay massage.

After flipping over she began massaging my little friend, who was standing to attention. Not a great deal of variation in strokes but, as it had been a while, I had to ask her to stop occasionally to prevent an early explosion.

She was a little shy but allowed me to touch her small but nicely formed breasts and gently caress her ass, while continuing the massage. After the deed was done she cleaned me up, I got dressed and she gave me a hug.

Would I return? Yes, probably.

Person's Name : Tina

Establishment : Yuki Massage

Date of Visit : Friday, 2 weeks ago

Rates : $70 for 30 mins

Age : 20-25

Size/shape : Slim and tall

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage & Tug. No other services offered or requested.

Value for money/recommend? : Not really, not as an overall experience.

My experience/comments : I was in the area and hadn’t visited for a while so I dropped by a couple of weeks ago. I was shown into the room by Tina and (after payment -$70 for 30 mins) we both stripped off and I lay on the massage table.
This was the first time I’d seen Tina and she said that she only works on Fridays. Physically I found her attractive – tall, slim, young and pretty.
Tina’s massage was fairly limited but pleasant enough, with her sitting on my lower body for most of the massage. On the flip Tina remained sitting crouched on the table and began her handy work.
She was very ‘shy’ about me touching her, flinching away a bit and complaining my hands were cold (even though I didn’t believe they were). The tug itself was okay, nothing special but did the trick. When the deed was done I happened to explode quite a lot and her cry of ‘oh my god’ was quite genuine, as was the cum that landed on her leg!
After clean-up Tina didn’t continue with any massage even though there was extra time. Strangely she stayed at the table staring at me while we made small talk. After a bit of this including several uncomfortable silences with lots of direct eye contact I made my excuses and got up to leave. Bit of a strange experience and vibe….

Would I return? Yes, but not on a Friday.

Yuki massage
620 Collins St
Advertised in City News
Mid March - on a Friday
Chinese. Size 12. Late 20s. 
Cost $45 for 1/2 hour massage. Extra $20 hj. Extra $5 nude.
I got there the same time as another punter. Neither of us knew which suite. He went in first and got Tina. I had the choice of waiting for her or taking the manager which I did.

She was in a big hurry. Massage technique good. She also does proper Chinese therapy with the heated cups if interested. Hi very good but had to ask her to slow down.

Would I go back? With the lack of options in Melbourne cbd i could not rule it out.

I found out today (in a potentially embarassing situation) that this place is either closed or closing in the near future.

I decided to visit and buzzed the usual apartment number. No answer... I figured they might be busy with another client or having lunch so I ran a few errands and then came back 30 mins later. Buzzed the number and still no answer...

Giving up I turned around to leave and a young asian lady apprached me and asked if I was looking for that apartment number. Several thoughts ran through my head as I tried to recollect if her face was familiar - "Have I seen you naked before?", 'Have you rubbed and tugged me?", etc.

Before I could respond with something less inappropriate and more tastefully worded she asked if I was there for the inspection. Now I wasn't sure if they thought I was the real estate agent (I was wearing a suit) or if the place was up for sale.

I mumbled something about "No, not really. I'll come back later" and slinked off.

When I got back to the office I checked a few real estate websites and found that yes, the place is being advertised.

Does anybody know if they've relocated? I can't seem to get through on the old number I have...

Heard several weeks ago that they were going to relocate.

See they are now advertising in Leader as Jasmins Massage, near Melbourne Central station and using same phone number as before/above.

Paid a visit recently to new location - newish apartment block in Franklin Street between Swanston and Elizabeth St.

Saw Tina and had similar experience to hardpaul above as although she looks fantastic her service is a bit rushed and massage not worth mentioning. Charge was $70 for nude massage with FS on offer for additional $50 making it expensive for a quickie.

Will not be rushing back.

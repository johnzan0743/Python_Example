Person's Name : Lily

Establishment : Orchid Chinese Massage Therapy

Date of Visit : 27 May 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Level 4 / 410 Lonsdale St. 9078 6692

Hours of Business : 11.00 am - 2.00 am

Rates : Special rate ATM - $65.00 per hour. Extras by negotiation

Age : Early 20's

Size/shape : 8 A would be my guess

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage and tug - bit of a feel.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : I saw the query from iceman in SE suburbs - I thought I owed it to the team to go take on, since it's just around the corner from home.

Very easy to book over the phone - they confirmed a special opening offer price (see the ad - orchid massage | Massages | Gumtree Australia Melbourne City - Melbourne CBD | 1038360032) so I went in search of something a cut above some of the dumps we have all seen and frequented.
Clearly a renovated office space, but atmospheric enough. From the time, money and effort they have put in it seems like they are planning to be there for the long haul. Nice rooms, a lounge with comfy couches and TV.
They have a VIP room too - but I didn't think to check it out.
Paid my $65 to the cute receptionist, and led to a massage room. Not sealed off, but heavy curtains, clean towels, nice music, candle - atmospheric.
Stripped off, lay there and waited.......and waited.....and waited, while apparently there was some long involved "chat" between a couple of ladies about the hour and the rate.
Eventually Lily came in - all dressed in black close fitting clothes and TOTALLY cute. What is it about those Thai girls that make then so alluring?
First she apologised for the delay (good form) and for not having very good English. She was pretty right about that.
Next a towel goes over my arse. Not a good sign, so i settled in for a bargain $65 massage for an hour - and she was good - VERY good. This girl really knows about massage. I floated on the edge of sleep, deciding not to get anxious about "would she / wouldn't she?" and just soak it up.
On the flip, the towel was placed over my groin area, so i figured that it wasn't on, so once again settled back for a high quality legit massage.
Then the hands start to wander under the towel. In her poor English she asks if I want a tug. $50 was the asking.
After some bargaining, which I believed her getting her kit off, we settled on $40.00.
A long slow build up started - but no de kitting. So I raised the question - she was (I think genuinely) surprised and shook her head.
So, I ran my hand up inside her top and under her bra for a play with her nipples.
At first she didn't want me to undo her bra, but we got there - and I found that under a ridiculously exaggerating bra she had the cutest, sweetest, firmest little A cup tits. MMMMMMMMM, my favourite!
She is a great cock stroker - she knows where all the "bits" are and how to move around them, stroke the balls etc. I was able to hold back and allow her to do her best - she did.
After the blow she did a nice clean up and finished the legit massage.
In the end I decided to give her a pineapple - just because she was so sweet, so young, so small, so pretty and I will get many, many wank fantasies about her for free!  ;-)
I hope you have a similar experience or better, and let me know - i would definitely go back.

Person's Name : Rose

Establishment : Orchid Chinese Massage Therapy

Date of Visit : 2/6/14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 4/410 Lonsdale St. 9078 6692

Hours of Business : 11.00 am - 2.00 am (yes, open late in the city!)

Rates : $50/30 + $40 extras (see review)

Age : Late 20s

Size/shape : Slim, A-B cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Unsure, PRC I think.

Services Provided : Massage, BBBJ, DATY, DFK, COB

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Was in town after a work function at about 8; rang Lotus -- closed. Rang M&J -- closed. Remembered seeing the review for this place, found it rang them -- open. Bingo. Went there with no one in mind to see -- luck of the draw. It's a funny place -- the lift opens directly into the massage centre. They have decked it out quite nicely. Ultra cute receptionist, took my $50 for the half hour massage, took me to the room, and after a couple of minutes Rose came in. 

Rose has short hair, slim, wearing a nice looking black sparkly dress -- and tights. She put on the CD (classical music) and turned it up -- this place has just curtained off area, no floor to ceiling rooms. I asked for a soft massage, no oil, and with that she said, OK, hopped on the table and gave me the biggest pummelling I've had in a long time. Things were looking grim. She hopped off the table, and started kneading my back from the side. I dropped an experimental arm, and touched her leg. All good. Started exploring further up, and was getting a nice feel of her arse (still outside the tights). She asked me shortly thereafter to turn over.

By this stage, I'd had no leg massage (or arse for that matter), and I was thinking WTF. She then comes back with the oil bottle, hops on the table, and starts massaging junior. Now this is more like it. She was doing a pretty reasonable job. I sat up and we started kissing. Unzipping her dress, and unhooking her bra led to no objections, so I enjoyed a feel of those small, soft tits. She was starting to moan quietly a bit by this stage, so I tried my luck closer tot eh pussy inside the tights. No, she said. That's cool, I'm enjoying what's happening. She then let out quite a gasp, leaned over, bit me on the shoulder then moved her head down my body until she took me in her mouth. And a very nice BBBJ it was too, minimal hand action, getting right into it.

I optimistically experimented down the back of the tights again; this time she pulled them off, along with the underwear. My fingers found her hole -- she was sopping wet down there. I gave her a vigorous finger fuck, and I think she may have come, but not sure. She came back up for air, so I pulled her up and she sat on my face wile I ate her out. A hairy pussy, quite fishy, but very enjoyable. She pulled herself down my body again, and for one minute I thought she was going to impale herself bareback on me! Fortunately, that didn't happen, and we get kissing until she said, "You out of time". She then gave me a terrific wank whilst my cock was next to her pussy and I came all over her.

As I started to clean myself up I saw that only 20 minutes had passed, but TBH didn't care, as I'd had a great time. (Afterwards I was wondering if she called an end to it in case she lost control and there was a chance of natural FS -- that's something I want to avoid). She politely asked for a tip; I had only $40 int he wallet, and she indicated that the expected tip would be $50, but she was OK with it this time.

WIR? Yes, to see Rose for sure, and to try others there. As I left, there was a real hottie (Thai I am guessing based on appearance) in a leopard print outfit sporting nice slim legs and a fuller figure further up. It's also nice to find a place that is open after 8pm...

Cheers,
Dean

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 4/410 Lonsdale St. 9078 6692
Hours of Business :  11.00 am - 2.00 am
Rates : $50/30 min plus extras
Age : mid 20's
Size/shape : small, petite
Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC
Services Provided : Rnt
Value for money/recommend? : No.

My experience/comments : Read a couple of good reviews here and thought I’d give them a try. Turned up on a weekday at about 4.30pm. As other punters have said this place looks quite swish and as though they plan to stay around for a while. No one around when I exit the lift, and a minute later mamasan arrives. I was hoping the introductory offer was still on but no luck – so I opt for 30 min for $50 which I think is a little high. I am taken to one of the cubicles with heavy curtains, told to strip, and that Lily will be with me shortly.

The cubicle is neat, clean, dark, with music and a candle. Lily comes in and with the low light, I struggle to make out if she is young or old, pretty or not. She seems fairly petite and nice enough, although her English is not that good.

A towel is placed over my rear and of we go. Massage is ok but is more a glorified rub than massage.  No real getting close to the nads before Lily asks me to flip – the towel neatly placed over my groin. A minute later she signals if I want a tug – sure I say and she says fifty.   I’ve had some pretty good experiences for a $40 naked rnt, and maybe I’ve become a bit tight, but my going rate for a clothed hj is $20, and I was willing to let this one slip by if we could not reach an agreement. She then said $40, to which I asked whether she would take her clothes off – no, that would cost more. OK then, $20, I said. She shook her head and was clearly not happy. This is when I realised what a mood killer this can be when an ML is rubbing your upper leg and you are arguing about the price.

I was quite willing and happy to let this g,o and complete the massage, but she was not going to let this go. A minute passed and she said 30 – no, I said. A minute later she reluctantly agreed to $20, although at this stage I was on the verge of telling her not to bother – because I was no longer in the mood – but I thought that would be a little mean.

I agreed and she whipped off the towel and started with some two handed fondling. Her rate and pressure were quite low, and although very nice, took longer than she had time for. She said I had to hurry up, and I responded that she would have to go a little faster – to which she replied no. Not sure why I got that response but I think something got lost in translation. I did my best to concentrate, and a minute later I was there. She cleaned up with a warm towel and that was it. She disappeared fairly quickly after that.

I found out that she is from China and has been here 5 months. Overall, WIR – possibly with Rose (after reading Dean’s review), but I think better value is available elsewhere. It’s interesting how different punters can have such different experiences with the same ML…..as they say….YMMV. Good luck punters!

I gave this place a try a few days ago. The place looks very clean. The rooms are isolated by heavy curtains and they seem private enough when the music is put on. An asian guy lets you in and escorts you to the cubicle.

In comes Rose. Her English is not great but she is friendly enough and starts to massage. After the flip, she rubs around the upper thighs and said something which I didn't catch but meant like do I want extra. How much I asked, and she said $50. I said that was too high, but she said that the boss insists on it. After a few minutes we agreed on $30 and that was it. The tug was very good and I was sorry when it was finished. 

She finished up at the 20 minute mark. I had a shower. The towel I had was not the best as it dropped lots of little fur balls but that was not a biggie.

WIR? I liked her massage, but have to think of the overall price, as it will be $60 + $50 (full rate) for less than 30 minutes. They have a daytime special of $60 per hour. Rose works in the evenings only.

Hey sbnp - I tried to book Linda today - she quoted $120 per hour to come to my place.

Never happened because neither she nor her cab driver had heard of Eureka Tower, or knew how to get there. It says something for BOTH professions, don't you think?

Here's a deal - you try Linda, I'll try Cara - we both report back, ok?

And she was a no-show.  Contacted her when she was 10 minutes late, she said she wasn't coming.  Cara never bothered getting back to me after initial contact.

Been to this place twice in the past month. The big sign saying 59.95 for an hour is misleading. That special is over now. It's a viet massage place from the looks of it. Girl at counter is viet and the 2 times I've been I've had viet girls. 

first time was with a youngish girl, second was middle aged.

No nude on offer just happy ending which is 50 extra. Review to come

The massage was good. Very legit and well trained. So got what i wanted out of my visit. As i flipped for her to massage the chest and stuff i noticed she was pretty cute and wore a sexy singlet. So o enquired about extras. 

She said 50 for tug which i negotiated down to 40 as i had nothing else on me and the cashier owed me 40 for not having change before. 

I was allowed to touch her but no removal of clothes.

This place is open until 2:00 AM as I understand it.

Dropped in here yesterday evening about 10 pm
Quite a well appointed place .it is seems to be staffed by Viets 4 girls on and at that time busy
No choice . I was allocated Yumi ( or Yuki) .She looked pretty good.Short ,pretty face,slightly plump ,good rak and dressed in a short black dress . Allocated " the VIP room" which was well appointed with a sauna ,shower and toilet and double tables.
I took 1 hr for $80 . Massage was very ordinary ,little skill,and a bit of a waste of time.She kept away from any brushes of the boys or crack,soft amateurish strokes.
On the flip she asked if I wanted HJ  and quoted $50. I sought to negotiate to $30 but no deal
" all the girls here are $50 for HJ " if you can believe that.I sought nude or topless ,no go
We proceeded at that rate. Half way through she asked for her $50 .i had to jump up and get that. 
Rules were introduced. No touching under the clothes,can touch outside etc.
If my hands wandered a bit to high on the back of the leg ( by accident of course) the dress got pulled down.
We got where we were heading after a time .i am a pretty polite sort of guy ,so it was nothing untoward of my doing ,but as soon as I was over the line,she asked if I wanted a shower,which I did, and took off for the next booking like the proverbial Bondi train.

Overall ,a pretty poor performance by her .She is an accountancy student who has been ther a month,about 23 years old very mechanical and not interested in interaction.
I would certainly not book her again.
As for the place,it is reasonably clean and it's convenience is the very late close.
On the way out Linda was playing cards with two of the girls,who looked reasonable.
Two guys in the lift commented to me that it was HJ only and for the ok for them.

Hi everyone.  I am having a little giggle to myself.  Only book Linda if you like a walk on the wild side.  Kimmy is ok, middle age, but not bad technique on the extras.  Doesn't allow too much else.  Try Jenni after 7.30pm for a younger unit.

My experience/comments : Dropped into this place around noon on a Sunday. You have to hit a buzzer on Lonsdale St and then they let you into the lobby and you take the lift up to the 4th floor. Very quiet and I think I was first customer of the day. Was hoping (as ever) for a younger lady but Elle was the only one on.  Average looker and squeezed into a dress a bit too small for her. Showing a fair bit of flesh for her age! She was a friendly lady though. Made me very welcome and gave a decent enough massage that included my sensitive bits. And i managed to have a decent fondle of her as well and a bit of a kiss and cuddle.

I'd been keen to try this place for a while but was hoping for some younger talent. Next time I'll go in the evening when the late shift are working.

Made a quick late night drop in here Sunday eve as it is one of the only late night venues open.
A couple of Aussie guys siting waiting and an Asian guy on the desk .
 He tells me Lavy is available (young). 
Ok so away we go.
Along the hallway comes Lavy ,slender,easy on the eye, dressed in the shortest body hugging singlet type red /pink dress you would find;nice boobs and tidy arse.
Hmm looks good.
I have booked one hour for $80.She shows me into the front room ,which is semi dark,lit by a corner lamp ,two tables and leaves me to undress. I strip off and prop on the side of the table .she comes in ,not much interchange or smile,but ok,and directs me face down for a medium relax.
.A reasonable back and legs massge ensues ( but in my mind is wasting some good time).The table is too long to test the waters on a feel of her assets as she massages from the top of the table.,so I wait the flip.
Conversation ensues.She is from vietnam and is a beauty student.She works Sunday and Monday only and not at the Prahran shop.
On the flip,I pop the question $50 for a handy and another $50 for nude and that is the limit.I tell  her $100 for a nude HJ is too much and suggest $70 or $80 is tops.
She won't budge , so I settle for a HJ only.She positions herself hard against the table ,and at top of my legs , so that touching is difficult.What she does allow is for me to slide the dress up at the back to  reveal one of the nicest tight firm and full round  arses you would find .She has no objection to a full hand of that under her pink lacy briefs and even the fingers getting in towards the date.
Conversation loosens up a bit and some nice smiles.
She tells me it has been a very quiet day for her(I wondered why she was not a bit more flexible on the money side). I tell her I would like to see her again.She says I must book her first.
She gets me  over the line in a steady and focused way  but her technique is a little bit on the hammer style( I tell her to ease up and to  slow down).
All in all a nice little punt and I would drop in again .i think she would improve as time goes on.
She told me she is 24 but my guess is a few years less than that and maybe still learning the ropes and perhaps a little shy or tentative. a girl/woman

Rose that works or used to work here was quite Ok in service most of the time, although her attitude totally stunk nearly all the time. She would never smile, never have friendly banter, BUT, strangely enough, would start sucking cock with no prompting at all, sometimes would get naked and allow touching everywhere, and other days she would keep moving away and pushing your hand away. One time I saw her was one of the days she wouldn't go nude, but she was giving me an Ok tug and letting me touch on top of the clothes. I was then allowed to go inside the leggings, but only to play with her ass, she then ducked her head down and started giving me a head job. After trying to get the clothes off for quite a long time, I gave up, and realised that on this day it just wasn't going to happen. 
Anyway, during the tugging and sucking, she somehow ended up on the massage table, which normally happened when she did nude, as she would then start to rub her wet pussy along my cock(no penetration), only on this day she wasn't nude, it was still fun though, she did take her top off, and told me to suck on her nipples. So there she is, kneeling between my legs, tugging and sucking, she stops, and tells me to sit up and suck on her nipples, I do this, and rub her pussy through the leggings. I can feel her getting wet through them, and she starts breathing very heavily, but as soon as I try to move inside them, or get them off, she gets a bit agro. While I'm licking her nipples, she lays back on the table, so her head is now at the foot end of the table, and now I'm the one kneeling between her legs, licking and sucking her nipples.

I'm rubbing her pussy like crazy, and after a while she can't anymore and ask me to stop, she stays laying down and just feels around for my cock and starts tugging again, I get an idea, based on my BJ's I'd received from her, I think she may be up for it, so without saying anything, I adjust my position so I'm on top of her, I tell her to squeeze her tits together and I start sliding my cock in between them for a bit of spanish, she looks to loke this. A few minutes go by and I tell her to stick her tongue out so she can give the tip of my cock a little lick and suck on the up stroke, she doesn't mind this either, so well, eventually, I found myself kneeling at her head, holding myself up by placing my hand against the wall behind her head, and fucking her mouth for a good 20-30 minutes. Not once did she complain, she did some awesome DT, she gagged a few times, I asked if she wanted me to stop, but she just grabbed my cock and shoved it back in her mouth, so I just kept fucking her face. When it was time to come, I told her and I stopped thrusting, thinking she can do what she wants, from there, either pull out and wanke me over her body, or point it away from her etc, but no, she started sucking more, faster and harder, grabbing me from behind, so I fucked her face some more, and blew the load in her mouth, I thought I was done and pulled out, only for the last squirt of jizz to land on her cheek and in her hair, the load that was in her mouth was never to see the light of day, not what i expected from her at all.

She seemed fine with it all, and didn't ask me for anymore than what I usually tipped her, but the next time I saw her, she tried to end our session 15 minutes early, she started tugging me, and when I started touching her, as we normally did without any issues, she promptly stopped the tug, pulled up pants and said times up.  I Had seen her try this many times, she would use the same tactic pretty much every session, getting started on the tug, then stopping before time was up, and also without me blowing, normally, she would get back into it when I told her she is wrong, we have time left, and I haven't had my happy ending yet. This time she would have none of it, and insisted time was up. We argued about time left for about the next 10 minutes, and when there was literally about 5 minutes left she said, Oh, I thought you may want to have a shower and freshen up, thats why I stopped with 15 minutes left. This was never the case before, we would use all of the time I paid for, and then I could have a shower. I didn't tip her after giving her a serve, then spoke to Linda on the way out, she tried to defend Rose by calculating the time, but I very nicely explained to her how I waited for about 10 minutes after stripping, and then spent the last 15 minutes arguing with Rose about the time left,  Linda said to come back another time and try someone else, I haven't ever been back, don't know if Rose is still there, but often think about that second last time I saw her and the great face fucking she let me give her, and the disappearing load.

I've heard that Kimmy is OK, does anyone have any comment on her, does she work here or only at the other branch?

I'm not often in this part of town, but yesterday I was, so I thought I'd drop in on the off chance to check out the talent. Paid my $50 for 30 minutes, and in came Lina, short and busty and chubby and bursting out of her clothes. As we started I asked if there were any extras on offer, HE for $50 she says. Is that with you nude? I ask, surely it would have to be for that price. No, that would be $100 for a topless HJ. In the end I negotiate it down to $60 for a topless handy.

Lina gave an excellent sensual massage. Come the flip (after 10-15 minutes), down came the top, and she went to work. Her tits were lovely. She invite my hand down the back of her pants to feel her generous arse, but around the front was a no go zone. She seemed to really enjoy this aspect of it through her actions. The HJ itself was crap; going at it like a piston.

Lina works Tuesdays and Thursdays.

I had been out to a massage shop called Pure Indulgence in High street Northcote for a very nice 1.5 hrs of straight massage from a pretty Thai girl but I know from several previous visits it is not worth asking for extras ( although they do a bit of poking and prodding around the vitals but nothing to get excited about (a very nice venue)

Heading back to the city with blue balls decided to drop into Orchid on Lonsdale ,as it was after 10 pm and most venues are closed.
Linda greets me $85 for one hr. I ask who is on, she says " nice young girl;only have young and pretty , want you to come back"

I might add Linda herself is looking worse for wear and I was glad she did not offer herself (a wild side experience in any event). In comes a young thing called Bella who is totally devoid of charm or personality .
I strip off and lie on the  table. No towel needed or offered.She starts on my back with a very perfunctory job.A bit like cleaning the kitchen bench.
After 20 minutes of this I suggest to turn over .She starts on my leg then immediately  suggests  extras in a deadpan grumpy voice ."how much " I say $50 is the reply." Do you do nude " ."no and nothing else"" "well that seems a little expensive"
She "well that is the price,that's what we all charge here"
Before I can say anymore she says"pay me now" in a demanding and not too pleasant way.
I say "that  really  is not the best way to talk to customers.You need to learn a bit.just go on with a straight massage and forget the extras."by then she is really getting sour and the hands start again on the leg,in a rough and angry manner.
I say" forget it I am not continuing" she says "I will get someone else to finish your massage then" and out she goes.
I wait 5 minutes ,about to get dressed WTF then in comes Bella mark11.i did not get her name,but she is a skinny little non descript version of Bella,with head down ,no hello ,sour look on the face ,who obviously did not want to be there.
"Forget it i" I say and tell her to go.
I dress (oil all over the back) and out to reception where Linda is ?I tell her and suggest she needs to explain client care and manners to this girl Bella.
Linda says that some customers leave without paying ,so asking for money half way through is ok by her .She then turns and starts to speak to a,new customer in a dismissive way. I leave.
Once outside I  realize  that I have done 30 mins but paid for one hr.
Half inclined to go back but WTF.
Last time I will go there.
A fairly unpleasant lot.
Linda looks like the wreck of the Titanic and the few girls I did see about are very  ordinary
So overall,a bad punt and goodby to them from me.

Hard luck there goboy, I tend to agree with you, they seem to have no idea about customer service at this joint, which is why I haven't been back since the episode I had with Rose. I think Linda is happy with her  mini fortune she has made at the other shop, so now she doesn't give a fuck about treating customers well, she knows there is "another one born every minute."
I wouldn't surprise me if Bella mark 11 that got sent in to you was Rose.

Reading Goboy's review above july 2015, it was probably for the best.

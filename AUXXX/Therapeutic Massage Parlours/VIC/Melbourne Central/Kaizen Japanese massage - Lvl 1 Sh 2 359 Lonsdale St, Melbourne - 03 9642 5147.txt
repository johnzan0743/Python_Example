My experience/comments : Was walking past and having had a mediocre session across the road and up the hill sometime ago thought I'd give it a punt. Up the stairs and greeted by a quite unattractive older lady who gave me the prices. I thought she might be the ML so started to head out. She said she had nice lady waiting so I was shown into a small and very basic room. A box of tissues on a chair looked promising and just a bottle of baby oil (hate baby oil - use a decent oil please!). Got undressed and lay on the table without the towel on. In walks another lady not much to look at and didn't say a thing. Puts towel over my backside and legs - not always an indication of no extras so wasn't sure how this was going to pan out. She did the whole half hour on my back with a fast rubbing action. Never got to my legs and no flip. It was a good back massage but this place is not for those looking to use the tissues!

Had a couple of shocking experiences here - and then from persistence, a couple of great ones (including a horny milf type - not the unattractive gal that runs it, but another chick in her late 30's who was seriously horny and sensual and excited and did a few lovely things for me with no extra cash asked for at all).  Different girls work different days here - the milf made an impression but the other shit thing about this place is that half the girls have piss poor English skills and I couldn't get her name.  The unattractive mamasan actually does a pretty good massage herself.  I wouldn't say there are gems here, but some diamonds in the (very) rough have raised their heads up a couple of time.

Person's Name : Meerway (unsure of spelling, but that's how you pronounce it)

Establishment : Kaizen Japanese Massage

Date of Visit : 13 Jan 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Level 1 Shop 2, 359 Lonsdale St (03) 9642 5147

Hours of Business : 10am-9.30pm 7 days

Rates : 30 min - $35 - 45 min $60 (she'll try and get you to pay more afterwards though(!)

Age : hitting 50

Size/shape : Slim and mature

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese 

Services Provided : Strong massage

Value for money/recommend? : Massage yes, atmosphere perhaps, extras very occasionally but scarce

Had a return massage here a day or two ago. Two mature ladies were on - Meerway(Sp?) the harsh faced but somewhat lean mamasan, and another mature chick of a slightly more curvy nature.

Extras here are very infrequent but can be had. I was just in the mood for the massage this week and went with what the mamasan had to offer.

In the room Meerway is somewhat warm in her gruff Chinese way, but she puts hard work into the massage and knows what she is doing. I expect she has had proper massage training somewhere. I paid $60 for $45 and she used her knees and feet and whole body (hanging from bars above) to seriously push the kinks out of my muscles and stretch my limbs, remove muscle tension etc etc.

Up front when I paid her the $60 she agreed and we began the massage. Then at the beginning of the massage session Meerway says "I do strong massage, very strong!". Yeah, okay, sure, go for it. This seems to be her trick as at the end of the massage she (more than once) will then say "I did strong massage! You pay me more money!" Huh? No, I said, $60 is all I have and I've paid you up front. She was a bit put out by this.

The fact is worth noting here to establish that she is somewhat money hungry and not adverse to doing certain things to earn a buck. I'll note that she can be somewhat handy, and on occasion will also allow her hands to be directed to places you'd prefer her to focus on. YMMV.

There is a box of tissues in the room if you feel like blowing your nose while you are there. Also - the much older guy who visited while I was there a few months back saw Meerway while I was with a younger chick, and somewhat moist rubbing sounds led into a silence which was broken by a loud raspy gasp, and Meerway then quietly chuckling to herself before the sounds of tissues could be heard for the bloke to blow his nose on.

I'd recommend people pop by here for a massage if they're happy for just that, and keep an eye on the other ladies (there are 4 or 5 others I've seen there sporadically) who all seem to offer a slightly different massage and have extra benefits on offer (ranging from none, to some, to one MILF who seems eager to do things for free that elsewhere would cost you a couple of notes at least). I rate the place for 'atmosphere' as it has that cheap Chinese flophouse smell and vibe where the mamasan is eating weird fish and rice dishes and everyone talks on the phone in heated Mandarin. If you come a cropper, head straight out the front door, cross the road to the footpath directly on the other side of Lonsdale St, then head up the street (Queens St direction) paying attention to the shops as you go. Within less than a minute you'll find another massage joint with a busy Chinese mother type who offers different massage services and has a few tricks of her own that she gradually unveils to repeat male customers who she likes and trusts.

Visited here yesterday as I was in a hurry for the lie-down and couldn't be stuffed catching the train to North Melb for the long run of shops there.  Possibly a mistake.  Despite insisting on a relaxation massage, Meerway (the cheery old crone who runs this joint) gave me the 'freebie' of a typical strong therapeutic massage instead.  She conceded an ass massage (her on me) near the end but didn't go the distance of giving any more extras despite me requesting them.  She's done it before but begged out now.  No other girls there when I visited.  Very variable this joint, probably won't be back in a huge hurry.  Worth investigating when they have other girls on as the quality thereafter is completely a mixed bag with some occasional gems and duds - Meerway is no spring chicken and now that the extras have stopped there is much better elsewhere.

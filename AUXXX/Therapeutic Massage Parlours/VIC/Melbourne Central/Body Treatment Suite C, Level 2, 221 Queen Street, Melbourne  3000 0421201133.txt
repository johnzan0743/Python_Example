My experience/comments :

Linda is a short but shapely and attractive mature Vietnamese woman, with a cheeky smile and playful manner.  She is probably in her 30s, early 40s at most.  She looked quite elegant, in a lovely short uniform.  Enticing zipper at front of uniform.
I have reviewed her before at another location last year and seen her probably about 6 times there, but she now has a satellite shop conveniently in the CBD.  Spectacularly clean new operation, white marble-like fit-out.  Appeared to be a few small rooms, but only Lindaworking there.  Reasonably discreet entry.  As with the the other location, it looked like a legit operation.
  The first part of the massage was first-rate, lasting about 40 minutes, with pressure, hot towels and stretching, as well as a bit of shiatsu and elbows and knees into the back.  Some hints of more on offer.   
  Then she leaned in and popped the question.  But the offer this time was $20 for T or $50 for Â– due to her English proficiency and my dopey but aroused state - something-I-wasn't-quite-sure-what-was being-offered.
Intrigued yet unsure, I took the $50 option.  This turned out to be: (1) she kept her uniform on, but let me pull the zipper down, getting a good view and feel of her breasts in her bra; (2) she wasn't wearing knickers, so I could feel her up a bit and sneak a peak below (but her legs were kept fairly shut); and (3) she gave me a very good tug while I pawed her.  Good eye contact and smile.  It was not value for money compared to others, but I was quite happy with the whole experience.  My impression was that I didn't get any more because of shyness. If so, maybe things could go further next time.  Of course YMMV.
  She then cleaned me thoroughly: tissues, followed by wet ones, and lastly more hot towels. Large towel back on.  Massage of head and scalp with a hot facecloth resting on my forehead.  Stretching of legs.  Massaging of arms and body generally through towel.  Finally I sit up and she sitting behind me puts her feet in my back.  I held her hands and she stretched my back against her feet.  Finish, about an hour.  Not sure if there is a shower, but I doubt it. 
 I will certainly go back when in the mood for this type of experience.

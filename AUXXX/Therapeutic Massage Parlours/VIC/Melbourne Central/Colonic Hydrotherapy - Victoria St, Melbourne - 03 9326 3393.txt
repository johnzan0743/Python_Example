Person's Name : Yuki

Establishment : Colonic Hydrotherapy

Date of Visit : 6/7/11

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Victoria St, Melbourne 9326 3393

Hours of Business :  7 days

Rates : $90/hr

Age : 20's

Size/shape : 10

Nationality or Ethnicity : prc

Services Provided : rnt

Value for money/recommend? : Not really special.

My experience/comments : Yuki was a disappointment. Normally the massage is good. I guess I keep going back because I have enjoyed the massage and know I will get a good finish. I would not class it as gem or even a good location. I enjoy relaxing massages and that's what I get. The girls normally seem in the 7+ group but I have never tried for extras. If you are like me and are just after a rnt with no haggling it is worth a try. I have noticed the last couple of visits that they have changed their price structure. Just ask for the $90 hour massage. The $70 massage is just that and then they will try for a tip, $90 has always been inclusive.

Out of a morbid sense of curiosity I did give this a try one visit. Did nothing for me but if you enjoy having a hose in your backside for 45 min it may be your thing (lol). In all seriousness the clinic part seems very hygenic and professional. At no stage was it painful but it did get boring. The impression I get is that the shop started as this, got bought out and then the massages began. WIR - not for this. It is fairly clinical.

Colonic Hydrotherapy, or Colon Cleansing, is recommended by some doctors. The process, if carried out correctly is supposed to flush out the feces and toxins from the lower colon and intestine, which is not normally passed when going to the toilet. It is also meant to destroy the parasites which line the colon. I have had it done twice in the past three years by qualified practitioners. Both times the procedure was quite painless however, can be a bit on the nose. It may be my imagination but the bowels do seem to function better after the procedure.

Hey all gave this place a go yesterday, not too bad. The massage was good plenty of oil and rubbing in all the right places, but them I was preety horny by this stage so anything would have done for me lol. But plenty of oil and teasing was good. Hand job was ok and made me load off preety quick, they don't offer any more than HJ's. There is another girls there I think her name is Emily love to try her.

The idea of colonic hydrotherapy doesn't seem very sexy to me.. In fact it kind of freaks me out a little bit. 
Has anyone tried it AND got a massage while they were there? I want to know what it is like!!

Thanks for your thoughts on this one SeaRay, but as the origins of this thread is specific to a service provider it should remain as it is.

Having said that, please feel free to start a General Discussion thread so this topic can be discussed in further detail.

Cheers,

BAB

Person's Name : Lavina

Establishment : 421 church street

Date of Visit :16/09/13 

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: 0403 316 358

Hours of Business :11am-8pm(Not sure)

Rates : $80/60min ($190 all together for this sesssion)

Age :22

Size/shape : Slim/Tall

Nationality or Ethnicity : Mauritian

Services Provided : Massage/B2B/HJ

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : While at work, I had an itch, an itch that needed to be scratched. Jump on Locanto to see what was on offer in the massage department. SMS ahead to find out there a Thai girl, Monica or a Mauritian, Lavina. Lavina was describe as tall, olived skin and sexy. I figured why not.

I get there at the agreed time, paid up and headed into a small room with a sliding door, probably one of the smallest rooms I've ever hada massage in, but a room non the less. Lavina comes in and instructs me to disrobe and place my clothes on the chair/stool. She starts with some strokes on my back and then further down. I opted for swedish and I told her I liked it hard, eventually I had to tell her to ease of a little as it hurt ever so slightly. 15 minutes into a hours booking and wanting to get my moneys worth I enquire to what extra may be on offer, I told 40 for a hj, 80 for topless(Not 100% sure from memory) and 120 for B2B.  I haggle down to 110 for the B2B. She strips off, lathers me with oil and jumps on top of me, sliding up and down, probably one of the less memorable b2bs I've had, she give me a hj and we finish. 

She continues massaging me until the end, with a final tuga at the end. This place has no shower, only hot towels, and its a pain to get the oil off. I didn;t really click with Lavina and definately won't be seeing her again.

Person's Name : Bobo.

Establishment : Kung Fu Massage

Date of Visit : Sep 2013.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 421 Church St, Richmond, Victoria 0426 887 309. 

Hours of Business : 11am - 6pm

Rates : $50 half hour plus additional $50 for extras.

Age : 20s.

Size/shape : Largish.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Said she was Thai but looked Chinese.

Services Provided : Massage + HJ + Topless.

Value for money/recommend? : No.

My experience/comments : I walked in - did not make a prior booking. Told that only one girl available who was Bobo and she was Thai. I was shown to the room and told to strip and lie on table face down. Room is quite small - walls are not permanent so are quite thin.

Bobo walked in. Medium height. Round body shape. A bit overweight. She looked more Chinese than Thai.

Started on massage which was actually pretty good. Quite firm but she knew what she was doing.

After flipping over, I asked what also was available. She said HJ and topless for $50. She took off her top to reveal large and firm breasts. 

Tug was poor - very firm and harsh. 

Wipe down with towels and water at the end.

Person's Name : Billie

Establishment : Kung Fu Massage

Date of Visit : May 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 421 Church St, Richmond, Victoria/0426 887 309

Hours of Business : 11am - 9pm

Rates : $80 - 60 Minutes $60 HJ $80 Topless $100 Nude

Age : early 20s

Size/shape : short, size 8ish, natural C cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian Italian

Services Provided : Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Not really

Was in the area and thought I'd give this place a try again. Used to see Molly a bigger Brit girl late last year. Sienna (ex Tokyo Milk) is now the receptionist there - told her that many a man's heart were broken when she stopped working at TM. She laughed and said that they'll get over it. Was told Billie was the only one avail. Paid for an hour and paid on the bed, in comes Billie - attractive, youthful looking, apparently down from Byron Bay for a while. Crap massage, discussed extras, agreed $80 on topless + HJ. Good conversationalist. HJ was a bit weak, but probably inexperience on her behalf (she was surprised that men liked their balls played with during a HJ! ). Good learning and cute smile, plenty of cute eye contact, got me across the line.

WIR? Not for her. Actually I've never had a fantastic punt at this joint. Will stick with TM or Pink Thai.

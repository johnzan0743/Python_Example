[COLOR=#333333]Looking for a cheap-ish private (had enough of AMPs for now) and found her ad on Locanto.  Very prompt to respond to SMS, no indication of any extras until halfway through the massage.

I've got a feeling I've been to this apartment before (just north of the CBD), but got a different room and she's a sole operator.  Candle and fragrance was subtle or non-existent, I didn't really notice it.  Proper massage table and she's had some training as it wasn't just a light run the hands over me.  Flipped over and she took care to do a decent job, managed to sneak a finger between her thighs while she was at it, but didn't push for any more this time.  Asked if there was anything more on offer and was told "no".

I'll probably see her again sometime.[/COLOR]

What part of November did you visit her? I saw her appealing ad on Locanto and tried both calling (just went to voice mail) and SMS with no reply. I tried a few times over 13-17 Nov with no joy and then gave up.

Monday 18th, she said she'd been quiet (not many customers) so I decided to help her out with a review.

Stumbled upon this massage venue when in the city. Great location - quiet and private. 

walked in and took the 30 minute option. 

Led to room (offered a shower but had come from hotel fresh anyway) and stripped down. The massage lady was straight in and started a light rub down. Some sensual teasing and good conversation. She was super pretty with long hair and stunning eyes. After 10  I turned over and indicated it was time to up the experience. Negotiated $50 and she stripped down out of a full dress and leggings to reveal a curvy and hot body. Wow. She started a slow and massage and after a while the momentum built to a glorious finish. 

WIR? Of course. Pretty lady and good conversation. Recommended.

My experience/comments : 
Was kicking around the Melbourne CBD and decided to visit an old fave. 

Walk through the HUB arcade, up the stairs, past the tailor and into the always dimly lit parlour. 

Greeted by the ever bubbly and friendly Vickey we made our way to the first room and I quickly stripped down. We've met before so i asked for the services up front. Once agreed the services we moved  into a relaxing full body massage. It was bliss. My back and legs were in seventh heaven and after 45 mins some tick tackle started and I flipped over. 

My beautiful masseuse stripped to reveal a stunning body; right curvy, bouncy C cups. She showed her body to full effect and started an epically sensual body rub.  The pace was slow, the visual element erotica at its best. She spent an indulgent 25 minutes bringing me to a climax of amazing proportions. 

WIR - yes. The studio is relatively discreet and decent, friendly talent.

$50 covered NHJ. Bodyslide was another pineapple on top of that.

It's all kind of hypothetical at the moment, but is (was?) this shop at Franklin St or the hub arcade?

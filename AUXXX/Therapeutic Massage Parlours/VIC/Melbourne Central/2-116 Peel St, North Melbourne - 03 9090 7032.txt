I made a return visit to check out what is going on here.i reported on my previous encounter here under the Asian Massage posting 33 Peel st.
116 Peel st is a few doors from La Porcetta on Victoria /Peel corner ,It has the outside appearance of a very legit ladies place , but has recently been altered .and looks in the midst of some changes.They have removed the massage chairs and also put in a sauna.

I went in on a Sunday recently ? Reception was manned by an Indan guy ,so I thought it must have changed owners.

i took a one hour booking with an asian girl Emily.

She was about 22 years and fairly plump , big boobs revealed from a low cut dress ?

I could not see any other girls around and the place looked quiet.

Went in to a clean room fresh towels ,stipples off and lay down .

She came in and  covers me with a towel and proceeds to massage my back from the head of the table and while starting that presses her boobs into my back.

i respond by putting my hands on her hips ,intending to slide the down ," No touching please". Hmm ,well ok ,looks pretty legit .

She proceeds to do a really good quality massage ,hands and forearms.This goes on for a little while ,but then I feel her forearms sliding up the crack of my bum and her trailing hand starting to touch the scrotum.

Well ok . I raise my hips a bit and she slides one hand underneath whilst the other fingers the date gently.
Comes  the flip ,and after a few massages around the chest ,she indicates $ 20 for extras.

i try to persuade her to drop the top on those bountiful boobs , but with a smile No , and still no touching?

She mounts the table and starts a Spanish through the front of her low cut dress.not very enjoyable because the material is rough 

She then starts a hand job and settles her face about 1 inch from the tip of my erect old fellow with her tongue out and mouth open aboce it. 

i get there but it does not become a BBBJ ,although she does lower the tongue for a gentle touch / taste of the end product .

A good clear up with a hot towel and a great time.Damage was $40 or $50 for the half hour ,plus $20'

She tells me that she is from Taiwan and works-at shop 4 Paramount as well,and also Belmore road in Balwyn ; so I am not sure where the IndiIan guys fit in ,maybe new owners of the lot.

All in all ,pretty ,good,not expensive and clear.Nice girl and great massage
I think there is more on offer from Emily on another visit .The place is open until 9 pm

I went in,empty except for a Chinese receptionist ,a girl of mid 20s  ,nerdy with glasses,very friendly however . She quotes $70 for the hour  and as I am tired ,that sounds relaxing ,legit and good.

shown into a spacious back room ,clean comfortable and fresh .She  follows me in ,and immediatly says we know one another from a city  place,She says I can look after you with knowing smile , an unexpected  result .turns out she is from Shop 4 at paramount in the city and 190  Belmore road ,from Taiwan and the place is run by the same crowd .

i negotiate n and she strips off , starting on a sensuous massage that slips into BBBJ finishing off with HJ  .very nice,I have forgotten the price now but it was in the range of  $60 extra , I have also forgotten her name (maybe Julie or Lisa )  overall a nice punt .

On the way out a gaggle of Chinese ladies had arrived for the outside  chair treatment .Another very nice looking Asian girl was attending  them.when they saw me emerge with Julie/Lisa I got a lot of inviting  smiles giggles,and knowing looks ,come on and Chinese elated comments.

Pity I did not have more time and the energy

Thank you for your post Goboy.

I have removed it from the original location (33 Peel St thread, noting that said you had mistakenly said you went to 174 Peel St, but meant 116 Peel St) and posted it where it belongs.

FWIW 174 Peel St is a Gym.

i last saw coco at 179a where she was doing a bbbj, this silk shop is very upmarket.  She was wearing a traditional massage suit with pants on.   Coco has been through the ringer sexually with me at full body care especially and at her age she needs to slow down a bit.  This shop looks and smells as pure as it gets.   Ive known her for a while and im pleased she is working in a more modern looking place that the run down shack out in sunshine.

Person's Name : Helen

Establishment : 2/116 Peel Street Nth Melbourne

Date of Visit : 06/10/2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 03 9090 7032

Hours of Business : 10am to late

Rates : $1 per minute  plus extras $30 for HJ

Age : 30s

Size/shape : 8  nice little body from what I could see but she didn't get clothes off

Nationality or Ethnicity : Taiwan

Services Provided : Full Body Oil Massage & HJ

Value for money/recommend? : it was OK  and good massage  knew what she was doing

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Went in just after 10am so I guess first customer,  2 girls on  Wendy and Helen

I say I want hour massage give the girl money and she shows me to room to let me get undressed.
I take off everything and lay on the table, look OK with clean towels and the obligatory tissues on the table

Helen comes back in and proceeds to start with the massage by putting a towel all over my back and massaging me with the towel and using pressure, it was pretty good for a start  then she removes towel and places it down around my legs and bum and puts oil on her hands and arms and starts a pretty good oil massage, I could also feel her breasts on my back as she leaned over me which was nice,  the massage was pretty good with her using good pressure and strokes,  then then use towel again to remove oil and then starts to oil up legs and bum and runs her hand and arms all over my bum and upper legs making me horny  and she gets sooo close to the boys so I raise myself slightly and she massages around the boys but not grabbing them directly, she eventually finishes the legs and asks me to turn over and then proceeds to massage chest down to my upper legs by leaning over me with her boobs pressing against me,   now I am as hard as a flag pole and then she moves around to the side and I look at her with those puppy dog eyes saying pleaseee    she say do you want suckie  and I say noo just HJ  as I want to see how it goes since this is the first time I have been here.

She proceeds to oil me up and goes to town on Johnny  very nice, Allows touching on the outside of the clothes, I dont try for much more this time but I gather more is on offer

All the time I m being massaged the front door bell is going as people are coming in for massage, a couple of times my girl goes out to try and arrange massages with men to come back later  so this place is busy from the get go  the other girl was Wendy as the guys cam in asking for her and she would yell out, sounds as though she is very popular, cant wait to try her out

Any way I eventually get over the line and Helen cleans me up  I give her $30 tip  get dressed and leave and she is showing the next guy in straight away after tiding up room,  walls are thin so you tend to hear a bit from what is happening in room net door LOL 

Anyway good massage and got what I needed so will go back for a few more goes to see what else is on offer.

Person's Name : Lily

Establishment : Red Silk

Date of Visit : 24-3-2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 2/116 Peel Street Nth Melbourne

Hours of Business : 10am-9pm

Rates : $50 1/2 hour

Age : 30

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : taiwanese

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Not really

My experience/comments : I had been to this place once before, not long after it opened. This time walked in as a large chap was coming out. No Papasan manning reception this time and a girl came from out the back and showed me straight to a room. "Have you been here before" was her first question. It's usually the first question these days!! Checked and her name was Lily. She looked familiar and I'm pretty sure I'd seen her at Sabadee in Paramount a year or so back. I know there's some cross over of girls here as previous time I'd had Ivy who also works both joints.

Lily would be in her 30's. Only mildly attractive but a nice trim body and happy disposition. And very soft warm hands that were quickly roaming my body. As I was getting horny she asked what extras I was after. I offered $30 for HJ and she looked offended and said $50. I asked if that'd be nude and she said no, that'd be $100. Sheez. At that point i remembered why I don't like this place and Sabadee. The price they ask for extras is outrageous. I needed a HJ though so went with the $50. Tried to instigate a bit of touching around the boobs and bottom and she put her hand out for another $20. Give me a fucking break……. Anyway, her soft warm and experienced hands did deliver a pretty good HJ that got me across the line.

I think I'll avoid this place in future though. they are just too greedy on the extras.

You are quite right about price and what is on offer Iva.
These  places and Balwyn are in the same stable.in the dictionary,."nude" means lift the top and pull down the bra.
In my view they are an expensive waste of time.The only value is Sabadee is open till 11 or so ,so it is a pit stop if you are in desperate mode.There is plenty of better value elsewhere ( eg Natural Massage in Bruswick where all the way means that and at reasonable prices )

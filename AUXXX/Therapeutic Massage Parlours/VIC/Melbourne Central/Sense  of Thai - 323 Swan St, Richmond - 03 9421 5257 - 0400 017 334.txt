Value for Money:Yes ,sure was.

This is a new place run by Jasmin (formerly of Bridge road Richmond Samui Sunset).
Opened 4-5 weeks ago.

I was passing and thought I would have a look in and surprised to see Jasmin on the desk and a worker Nicole siting in reception waiting for a customer.
It is decorated in the Thai style , clean and fresh, new towels, futon bed ,and the usual.

Jasmin suggested I see Nicole who looked quite nice.Nicole,however was dressed in traditional Thai robe and black cullot pants and hard to get a view of her shape.Nice smile nice attitude.

i pay my gate fee of $65  and taken into a warm new carpeted room with Thai style floor bed futon.
i strip off and lie face down and cover my ass with a nice fresh white towel(as I am not sure what the go is here and it looks so legit --although I have good memories of Jasmin)
In comes Nicole .Very pleasant. " any special parts you want done?"
I,"well all over would be appreciated" .nice generous smile from her.

She applies a fair amount of oil to the back.it is however a good quality oil and the feeling is relaxing in the extreme.She has very supple and soft hands and I am luxuriating into this massage.
She starts to slide her hands under the towel for the ass massage then removes it completely.
Her ass and leg massage are beautiful .lots of sliding fingers which eventually start to focus on the crack and undercarriage, with those sliding two hands up the legs in unison that finish in the balls and crack.
Very nice.
on the flip,she does not bother with the towel,and oils up the stomach and legs and slides the hands slowly over the old fella.Nice smile and gentle style,slow and easy.

"You like?". I,"Sure do " "you reward me?""of course"No talk of $or services.
She slides into one of the better HJs you would receive ,slow and easy and ,as I said,very supple ,soft fingers and hands ,and she known how to use them.
I "this is very nice,what more can you do?" Reply " I need to get to know you after two or three visits"
Make of that what you will. 
She is robed in thick traditional Thai top,not exactly enticing or sexy,but whist slowly carrying through her HJs she leans above it and drops her jaw open ,which looks encouraging,but all the time the diminutive ,
slightly proper Thai girl.
She tells me she worked in Moonie Ponds Thai before so she has training and experience .

We get to where we were heading and on time  and the a wash down with hot towels.

i think she mentioned a shower.A cold iced water is brought in .
I dress and produce $35 , "is that ok?"
She "is $50" . Now we all know a clothed HJ should not be that figure although Samui Sunset (jasmin's heritage) operates steadfastly at that range (although Nicole is from Monnie Ponds shop).
i am mindful of the "next time " indicator so don't argue too much 
All in all,a top massage.
On the way out Jasmin has gone home and a very attractive Jenny is on reception.I make a point of  a chat to her and decide I will return for Jenny next.
Nicole works M to F,Jenny W to Sat.
A good quality shop, clean ,not on the wild side and a good massage

I did a follow up today for Jenny ( by the way "Nicole " is not Nicole or "Natalie" .I think Jenny said it is "Natasha")
On reception was a very nice number called Ricky who used to work at Osborne st Sth Yarra .i will have to give her a try.

Paid the starting gate fee of $65 for one hr.
Jenny comes in dressed in traditional Thai,black cullots and black singlet with gold coloured Thai long sash down the front of the pants , long black hair,slim attractive 27 - 29 range.

I have stripped off and as I don't know her ,covered my ass with a fresh white towel.
This place is very clean and well set up .Nice bathroom clean futon covers that are changed after the customer as you are dressing and clean fresh towels.

Jenny is very pleasant and talks quietly and in a willing conversation but not over the top. She is from Bangkok,and has been here for two years ,but says this is her first massage job. She is professional in her skill level.

She starts on the back .I tell her I have known Jasmin her boss for many years from Samui Sunset in Bridge rd and Port Melbourne.That seems a passport to a more giving girl.The towel comes off and she proceeds to the ass and legs.
She gets into a nice crack /date and ball rub which goes on for 10 minutes or so.Hard to contain myself.

I turn over and she starts with a chest massage then down to the old fella.As she rubs the old fella she asks whether I want atention there and whether I will pay extra and indicates $50 for a HJ .
I ask for nude, but she demurely declines .
I think $50 is standard here .I have  not negotiated on my two visits as I want to feel out the offerings, so i indicate lets go.
Her massage,like my previous visit with"N" is soft and quite sensuous.Slow ,easy,feeling fingers everywhere .Who can complain with this.I lie back and enjoy it.
My progress on this occasion is however also slow.Nothing to do with Jenny, just me.She says "you not cum?  I not let you go until you are happy" .
So off she goes again.No guy would complain about her work , just I am slow today.

She senses more is needed to accomodate me  and her gentle demeanor starts to change to a new sexy style .
Her  mouth start to mimic sucking and her eyes light up with an excited look , slow panting ?
Wow this is enough to get me anywhere.I can't get over the change , from demure Thai princess to alley cat underneath a facade. This is paradise.
I am very happy and cum with a bang . She starts to caress me down and then"hot towel or shower"with a soft smile as she  strokes my chest .
As she massages my chest she smiles and gives me the old line "you are big man there.make me and any girl very happy . I like you a lot.. You come see me again and I will look,after you".

Well who can resist that (even if said to each and all of us , ha ha ).
A nice slow wash down.She brings me a cold drink and whilst I dress she puts fresh towels and futon covers on.and wipes everything down , all  very clean and fresh again.
I pay my gratuity and a "see me soon".
She  works 5 days M to Sat .very nice.
On reception is still Ricky  from Osborne Street Sth Yarra.She is very pretty  and nice engaging smile , slender and good looking,maybe about 20- 23yrs.
Not sure what the limits are here.I suspect it is like Samui Sunset,that is,, it depends on the girl and what they know of you,but basiclly fairly straight with good standard masseuses.
A good place to return for a relax

Love your attitude Goboy, it will take you far. This place, by the tone of reviews so far, is a must visit if only for the perceived serenity and cleanliness. I am taken by the traditional dress and culture.

Name:Ricky
Age : 19
Nationality:Thai
Rates:$65 for hr,plus extras
Size and shape: slender
Value: reasonable 
Date of visit :10 Jan
My experience:
Dropped,in to see Ricky. I had previously chatted with her on exit from my last visit and was determined to give her a run. 
She is young ,She tells me she is "below 20  yrs " so it seems she is 18 or 19 .She comes from Bangkok and has been here a year.She works Saturday and Sunday,but at another shop during 3 or 4 of the weekdays.(I know the other shop on the other side of the river and it is not renowned for extras ,depends who you hit on) .
Ricky is slender ,medium height , long black hair ,very pretty face and a generous mouth with a gorgeous big smile sexy body , quite engaging.
I booked her for one hr.
As said previously,this shop is new and very well set up, clean and run in the traditional Thai style.The girls wear black uniforms and it looks very professional.
Ricky is dressed in a black singlet top,long black cullots,and a Thai sash over the pants and sandals.
I strip off and lay down on a futon bed.i put a towel over my ass as I am just searching out the limits here , and it certainly has no air of "anything goes".
Ricky comes in and settles herself up high  between my legs ( which she spreads wide apart) and starts into what is basically a relax massage on my back .  Soft and easy.
She is quietly chatty,talks about her arrival here,no time for a boyfriend,study and life in her apartment.
I tell her I have been here at this shop before and seen most of the girls and that i have also had some very enjoyable times at her other location .She says work has been slow today and how often do I massage and maybe iif I like her massage she hopes I can come see her  regularly. Why not!
Her hands start to slide around the crack and pretty soon she removes the towel and throws it to one side , and proceeds into a studied slide up and down the crack and underneath and over my under carriage .This goes on for maybe 10 minutes .
Most enjoyable. I am raising a bit to allow her some better access.

"Turn over please". On the flip she starts with the legs and a liberal app of oil.Then with  both hands she slides over the old fella which she takes hold of,,"can I do here ? Price is $50". 
I know this is top of the range for a HJ but my assessment is that this will take a visit or two to see where it can go, so I say "Yes ok today,but expensive just for that,maybe some more extra next time" 
She says "I hope you see me next time"
So I let it proceed on that basis.I can't help feeling she looks so professional , with not a hair out of place and a lovely gentle style and engaging smile.Hmmm  this may take a while to work out.

Her HJ is very good,very nice.soft ,varIed speed and eye contact and big smile throughout .Now and then she breaks off for sweeping strokes over the chest and down the legs ,then head down and back to business.she easily gets me over the line.A  happy face and a nice "you enjoy?i am so glad you happy,I enjoy too " .(sure am,happy baby )
I did not push the limits with this one.i was conscious that the practise at her other shop over the Yarra is fairly conservative,so I thought that maybe where she comes from,but I think with her i will,see if more is available.
She is a nice little visit for a relaxing Saturday or Sunday,nothing on the wild side ,but a quality massage at a professional shop and a very pretty young lady who is worth spending time with.

After reading Goboys reviews decided to give this place a try. Was in need of a nice long massage so called and booked 90 mins. 

Booking was easy, friendly staff who welcomed me when I arrived at the appointed time. Few girls hanging around in reception all who seemed pretty young. Had a quick chat then was off to the nicely appointed room where I was asked to get ready then wait a few mins. 

No signs about leaving clothes on so I stripped, covered myself with a towel and waited. Not long after a very young looking girl walks in and announces her name is Nisha. Tiny girl with a cute smile and braces. To be honest I thought I was out of luck with extras as she looked so young. 

The usual questions about what kind of massage I wanted (hard) and I settled in to relax and enjoy. The usual chat followed with how long had she been in Australia, she is studying English. 

Massage was pretty good, not quite as hard as I like but no complaints really. As she was massaging my legs she asked if she could take off the towel. of course I said go for it. 

Plenty of butt and inner thigh work followed which surprised me a bit. Really wasn't expecting that from such a young looking girl. 

After around an hour of a good Thai massage with knees elbows etc she asked me to flip. She didn't even bother covering me with the towel and I didn't reach for it. 

She started on my feet and slowly worked her way up getting closer and closer. I asked the question when it was obvious what she was planning and she said "of course, $50". Didn't want to bargain and I knew $50 was standard here so I accepted. Didn't request anything else either. 

Pretty good technique got me over the line with no trouble. She didn't stop for quite some time and then gave me a great cleanup. Probably one of the most thorough post tug cleanups I have had. 

She left the room for some hot towels to remove the oil, then as we had some time left gave me a nice head and face massage. 

Bit of a chat while I was getting dressed and she changed the sheets and towels. I asked how old she was as she looked so young and she told me 19. I think she could pass for younger. 

Nisha works weekends and Monday afternoon. 

Would I Return ? Yes. Probably will try another girl though. Nothing wrong with her service but if I am after more than just a rnt I don't think she is the one.

My first visit here - thought I would have a crack given the positive reviews. 
The place is nice and clean - I asked to use the toilet prior to beginning and was shown upstairs - bathroom spotless.
Shown into the room - mattress on the floor - this is a bit of a negative to me as I like to keep my upper spine level - without a "face hole" this can't happen - if I turn my head for more than a few minutes my neck will pain. Still no big deal if all is well.
I asked her if I should take my underpants off and Jenny smiled and said "of course" then left the room. I lay there for a few minutes - a bit tense and excited and am reminded why most punters like to move around so much - the "thrill of the hunt" is a big part of what brings most of us back. I admit I'm terribly lazy in this regard!
So Jenny comes back in I ask her her name and I act surprised that I haven't heard of her before - I mention a couple of the other girls names and I'm in as a bit of a regular (sometimes gets me past "1st visit caution" on the part of the ML) and then we get into the massage - it's was ok I guess - I wouldn't come back for it. The massage itself was a bit clueless and didn't do enough sack/crack work for me (I do like a lot of the teasing!).
On the flip so offered a tug for $50 - that is a bit high for a tug but it certainly seems to be the store policy so it is what it is. My hands started wandering to her boobs (over her clothes) and she indicated that it would be $50 more - I hope that was for topless! Even so I wasn't going to pay $100 for a topless tug so I declined.
She asked if I wanted slow or fast - I like this attitude I must say (I went for slow)  it was an ok tug - I encouraged her to play with my arse (she again asked for $50 - oy vey!) I declined and was brought  to an acceptable finish.
Would I return? Yes to try one of the younger girls but not for Jenny

Value for money/recommend? : No / Once off way too $$$

My experience/comments : 
So I made my first visit to this place in a long time as my usual girl from here has unfortunently left and I rolled the dice with summer. This place really feels like a high end massage place and really is a step above the normal dodgy looking places but obviously comes with a price tag and I think that's what the shop aims to be. I was extremely impressed with summer as she was gorgeous and fit.
The massage started like most massages but slowly worked its way into lots of teasing and reaching right around to get a full handful of my package. Once we turned over she waited for me to ask for more. Eventually she told me $50 for normal hj, $100 for touching, and &150 for topless. I tried to convince her to go cheaper for a long time but she just wouldn't budge and unfortunently I caved in as I was cashed up. I know I'm stupid but...
If ever a girl was going to be worth that sort of coin then she is pretty close to it! She took her top off and she was wearing this gorgeous sexy bra that held a nice set of fake dds. I played with them for a bit and then removed it. They looked bloody amazing. She also let me suck them as much as I wanted. Her handjob was very decent!
Definently in no rush to return but it was a decent experience with a very sexy girl!

I agree. It makes it tougher to the lot of us who wouldn't be able to pay they extortionate rates. 

Is Summer Thai or Viet?

My experience/comments :
So I tend to visit this place when I am in the area. It is generally very good quality in the way of the girls and the rooms and ambience of the place is great. I made a random booking as the girl Sonya that I usually book no longer works here. I rocked up and was greeted by Emma. A very nice looking girl and strait away I was hoping to change my 45 min booking to 1 hour but supposedly she had another booking. Started with the usual back massage with a bit of teasing. Turned over. She is a nice looking girl. Was hoping to do a topless hi, but her prices were just silly. Something like $250. Tried negotiating for a while but realised I might as well just enjoy my $50 tug. I take it she pretty much never does a topless tug. Obviously made me come. The place is great for gorgeous girls and the cleanliness of the place. It really is high end. But just pricey. WIR lol yeah I will return when I'm in the area. Prob not for Emma but maybe next week after work xmas party for a different girl

Value for money/recommend?mehhh

Experience:
So it was a bloody hot day...44 degrees. Work break up was over and had always planned a visit here. I rang up to hear the girls names and picked Linda as she was one I hadn't seen before. I arrived and was greeted by Linda. Who was pretty average looking. I was taken to my very nice looking room and I asked to take a shower to freshen up. The thing I love about this place is that it is a very high end rub and tug. The bathrooms are decked out nicely with shower gel and colognes. I return to my bed and nude up. The massage was very good and like any sensual massage progresses to the nice touches between the legs. Followed by much more deliberate touches and the folding up of the leg for better access which I love. By this point I'm very turned on. I flip over and have a very hard erection which Linda smiles at. She says do I want a massage there. I say of course and try to negotiate a topless massage for a reasonable price. But she wants $150, which I know I have paid in the past for the extremely mint 'summer' which I could actually justify, but for the quality of Linda was just ridiculous. So we opted for the normal hj for $50 which sucks as I love seeing tits. The hj was nice but she stayed far away between my legs so even if I wanted my hand to roam then they couldn't unless I was inspector gadget. Wir: not for her but will randomly try other girls

Value for money/recommend? : happy new year everyone. My first punt for the year! I dropped in randomly after a few catch up drinks with friends in Richmond. I met Nicole at the door. Nothing special to look at. I was shown to a room with two clean mattresses on the floor and a shower in the room. Nicole basically said nothing and just showed me to the room. So she was already a bit cold. I lay naked on the mattress after having a shower to freshen up. The sheets feel amazing at this place! Nicole turned up and begun massaging. She wanted nothing to do with small chat. At this point I'm thinking stuff this bitch she ain't getting any extra money out of me. She begin a bit of teasing and then full reaching around. Started to feel very good. We flipped over and she still did teasing then asked is there anywhere else to focus on. I said of course but how much. And it was the normal pricing at this place $50 handjob, $100 touching, $150 topless. And no bargaining. I opted for just the $50 option. Bit continued to receive a bad attitude but the handjob was actually not bad. Wir lol probably will at some point.

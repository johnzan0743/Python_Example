Walked past this joint a few times but couldn'tfind a review on it so thought I take a punt. Rang the number but it wasn'tworking so I just walked in. Entrance is actually on Russell St (just on thecorner) and up some stairs.  Apparently a new place but nothing flash andjust curtains.

Booked the massage and in walked Katie. All seemed veryprofessional which was a worry so I put the question to her early on. she said"you relax and Katie take care of you". She said $30 for a rub and upto to $50 if you want to touch. I said I'll just go the rub and she offered totake her to off for the $50 and "maybe" her dress. Katie gave a goodrub but she had passed her used by date in the topless market place.

Only downside was Katie had to leave an answer the phone acouple of times because the other girl didn't speak english. She definitelysaid to one punter on the phone "no we don't do that", by which timeI was already at full mast so that gave me a chuckle.

Apparently other girls offer more so for a $50 investment I'llbe back to check out some of the other talent.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 03 90189157 L1/168 Bourke St, Melbourne

Hours of Business : Closes 8pm

Rates : $55 / hr, rnt $30 or $50 topless (cost me $105 all up)

Age : 45-50yrs

Size/shape : 10 c cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : asain

Services Provided : HJ, Boob rub, anal stimulation

Value for money/recommend? : yes

Walked in and there were two ladies behind the counter. Only one was available which was Katie so behind the curtain with her I went and she already had her hands on me.

I paid the $55 but held out an extra $30 and said I want the special treatment. She asked if I had been there before (which I hadn't but I said I had). Katie said $30 good for a HJ but if I want topless and touching it's $50 (inclusive of the HJ). So an extra $50 it was.

She was about to leave after asking me to strip and lie down but I asked her if she could stay and undress me. Katie obliged and while she was undressing me I had a good feel of her boobs and arse to which she had no problem.

The massage itself was good but the topless had a different twist. Basically she would only take her top off when I was lying down at which point she was happy to oil them up and rub them all over my back but she didn't want me to roll over and see them - weird.

I was pretty horny so I rolled over (at which point she pulled her top down) and she proceeded to give an expert tug. I asked for a tickle in the back door and happily agreed and pulled out one of those surgical gloves and got straight into it (I do like a women who comes prepared).

Also while giving the HJ she cocked one leg up on the table to allow my hand full access to her pussy. I put a little oil on the fingers and in they went with no objections. 

She had fingers in me and visa a versa so when I came it was a full body experience for which she showed the right amount of appreciation.  

After a nice clean up she said "you come back and we do more". 

Katie is getting on a bit so I suspect she has to offer that little bit more to keep us coming back.

Yes I did, booked an hour.  Massage was average, she just rubbed oil with soft strokes but she had a great personality and spoke decent English (she had previously lived in the US)...and she was cute!

Visited a few days ago.  Cute student-type masseuse gave a shithouse oil-rub massage with no extras offered or requested (as her emphasis on towel-coverage told me all I needed to know).  A bit bizarre as Pings Body Care elsewhere in Melb is notorious for offering extras, these young hairdresser newbies are really spoiling the brand.  Will not return.

Person's Name : Angel...or Angie

Establishment : Pings Full Body Care, Melbourne

Date of Visit :  9/5/2014 

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : level 1, 168 Bourke St (enter of Russell St)

Hours of Business : Not Sure

Rates : $1 per minute

Age : 20's

Size/shape : Thin but hard to tell as fully clothed up

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : Massage only

Value for money/recommend? : 

My experience/comments : 

Booked 45 min and shown to room with curtain next to reception so that immediately dulled any expectation. Took clothes off and saw towel on table so place over my naked arse to do the right thing. A couple min later reception girl entered and started to massage feet of arranging towel to cover everything properly. I told her if it was in her way it was ok to remove my no response. At this stage I knew there would be no fun here so told her I genuinely has a pain in shoulder which she said OK. After doing legs & back she asked me to flip and made sure towel was in place again. 

Overall. Massage was good and firm and attended to shoulder as asked which felt a lot better afterwards. Better massages only elsewhere if that is what you are after.

Person's Name : May

Establishment : Ping's Body Care

Date of Visit : 10/3/16

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As above 

Hours of Business : 10-8

Rates : $30/30 mins + $31 tip

Age : 40s

Size/shape : Comfortably MILFy, pleasantly attractive, average build

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

Was in the area, and as Winnie's place has now gone, I thought I would try here with low expectations. $30 for 30 minutes standard massage is below the going rate (typically it's $45 or $50), hence the low setting of the expectations.

The geeky looking receptionist set me up with May, and we moved into the tiny room. Jeez those cubicles are small! We settled on a soft massage (do you mean soft, or "soft", I was asked, and went for "soft") which was a lovely 10 minute caress with some nice erotic tickling. Before long, I flipped, and May asked for $50 for a HJ, I countered with $30 which was accepted. May provided an excellent HJ, first class, all the while asking me to keep quiet. I ended up erupting everywhere and she cleaned it up with some nice hot (really hot) towels. There was 10 minutes left, so I got a nice leg and head massage for the rest of the time.

May works Mon, Tue, Thu here. For $61 it's good value although nothing special. Will return.

(The tip was $31 as I only had a $20 note, a $5 note and some change left. As I'd offered $30, I did not want to short-change her with $29, so opted for $31.)

Person's Name : Lisa

Establishment : Ping's Body Care

Date of Visit : 29/3/16

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As above 

Hours of Business : 10-8

Rates : $30/30 mins + $30 tip

Age : 40s

Size/shape : Average, nice curves

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Massage + topless HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

After my last experience, I dropped in again, and was given Lisa. Lisa is an older lady, say mid 40s?, with pleasing curves. I asked for a soft massage, and got a decently hard one, but on the flip, we negotiated $30 for HJ plus semi-nude (flashing of arse and pussy, and some considerable tit play, with light kissing). The massage was good, the HJ was average, the mouthful of boob was an unexpected bonus, and I walked out $60 lighter and quite a bit happier.

Overall, this place seems to be reasonable; losing 10 years off the age of the MLs here would be about the only improvement I could recommend (apart form bigger rooms...)

This was a fill in shift for Lisa; Lisa works Fri-Sun (and is looking for a boyfriend).

Just one more note on this place. I did have another session last week with a GIRNF (Gran I'd Rather Not Fuck). Hardly spoke any English, didn't get her name, was probably around for Zsa Zsa Gabor's birth, and gave a crap handy. However, Lisa and May cover six days of the week...

 Samui Sunset Massage - 184 Bellair St, Kensington - 03 9078 7089

There have ben previous posts about the mother shop near the Bay.  While this satellite shop is smaller it shares the same girls and uses the same modus operandi.  So, if you want a good massage and a probable, but not certain, offer of a relatively espensive ($50) tug at the end, this place is an option.

I went along last week and saw N... who works Fridays and Saturdays I think.  She was quiet to start but warmed into the event, becoming very chatty and friendly by the end.  She was also happy to make the offer on the flip.  (I have had previous experiences in the other shop where this is not the case and you need to pay for an extension of time as well as the tip if you are so inclined.)

N is young and attractive, slim with B cups helped by a bit of padding that remained in place but was felt form the outside.  I'd happily see her again.

Punters should be aware that I have been her a couple of times before and enjoyed the massage but nothing more.

If this is who I think it is, you might get more that you bargained for with P, as I think she might not be a she...

My experience/comments:

Had a great massage from Nadia (or Naya) she was very friendly. She gave a great thai massage. Lot of stretching. Then towards the end she started with the extra rubbing on the inside thigh. On the flip she asked if i'd like more. I said definitely! she said $50. I said that was lot, and she laughed and said I'm really good. hahahha. can't argue with that. So paid the $50, and she was great! even allowed some touching.

WIR? Yes, it was a great massage a great looking girl and a great finish. even if it was a bit expensive.

First visist at this place and nice set up - friendly Thai staff - meet Cat - typical Isaan girl - darker skin, friendly and bubbly - nice to talk to and gave a decent massage. Started with a bit of Thai and then she whipped the towel off, which meant there was more on offer than massage. The oil massage was hard and sensual - always slipping between the legs by accidient, to get my attention. Time for the flip and she just kept that cheeky smile going, asked the question do yuou maasge everything and she smile back yes "but that costs a little more". Tried to get her down to 30 as 50 gets you alot more at other places but refused to go down in price. In the end decided to decline and maybe next time she will exept 30.......

Would I go back ...yes just for the massage as it was a great.

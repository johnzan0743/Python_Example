Hi there,

Have picked up a couple of whispers about a shop at 325 Collins (I think it's a serviced apartment building). Does anyone have any info? All my usual sources have come up with nothing.

Thanks,
Dean

It's the serviced apartment building which you enter from Elizabeth st near the subway and officeworks on Elizabeth near the corner of Collins st
Wouldn't stress yo, the joint is shit and overpriced
But they advertise on locanto if your still interested in sourcing out the joint

I posted on the other thread on this - that place is fully legit place which happens to be run out of a residential apartment. Theres zero chance of extras there.

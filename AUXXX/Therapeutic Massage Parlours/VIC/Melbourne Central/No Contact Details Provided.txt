Age: Early 20's

My experience/comments: This is a well known Thai massage shop in Port Melbourne with a few venues.  I've tried a couple of them and it is very hit and miss.  They let you disrobe completely, some use a towell for modesty, some don't.  This time there was lots of "accidental" from very early on in the hour, yet I still need to prompt for the HJ at the end.  Little hope of much more I feel.

Went again the other day and saw Y. Y.  She is early 20's, tall, slim, B cups, long hair and really quite attractive.  Massage was good, she is intelligent and carries a good conversation.  Lots of sack and crak touching and no attempt to make it seem accidental.  After the flip, nearly all the attention was centred on the groin area and even a few slides up the pole.  Then, the mercenary stuff started, a "times up" announcement with things very heated.  Not only was their a need to pay the tip but there was a need to extend as well.  Not thinking straight I agreed and must say that she did a great job.  Slow and continued after the eruption.  In the end, she backed off on the need to pay for the extension.  Maybe YY felt a bit guilty.

The girls here seem to have got their tactics and prices coordinated.  $50 is the standard for HJ and they want a further $50 for topless.  A bit rich.

Thanks for the reviews JJ. I think I have it figured where you mean although one of the other branches is closer to me. Thai places in town all seem to be able to get away with around the $50 just for HJ which is expensive. But I do keep going back!

My experience/comments: After taking JJ's review, I dropped in today for a 1hr massage. The massage was sensational and I was very very impressed with N's skill. It really is a legit massage place, not a pretend one. I hinted at HJ towards the end and she stated that it was $50 extra. I said this was too much, and to make it $100 for the total 1hr massage plus HJ. She agreed at $30 extra for the HJ ending after a bit of playful back and forth and all were happy.
All in all very very good massage (back feels great) and a very skilled ending. Highly recommended!

Rodline, I got a bit busy at work and didn't make it, too bad.  I 'm heading to NZ on business soon and hope to partake then.  You've got to love the A$, sensible laws and a few good websites (newzealandgirls and adultforum).  I hope to post about some happy times.  Cheers, JJ.

Dropped in today for a massage and the 'like'. Usual rate, plus $30 for the pleasant conclusion by Pinky.

My conclusion? Poor massage, she was too busy chit chatting and sizing me up as a customer for extras to pay attention to the massage. Then when we finally got to the conversation, I named my price and she was haggling over $5. I told what I paid previously and that THAT was the ceiling I was willing to pay. She refused and kept haggling over the $5. 
The conclusion wasn't that special and she asked for payment prior to me even going for my quick shower like I was going to run away with her $30. Don't bother with Pinky, not worth the money for a massage or otherwise.

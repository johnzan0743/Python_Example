Person's Name: Random Asian chick - next one available after I walked in.

Establishment: Royal City Massage, Melbourne

Date of Visit: 2 April 2013

Contact Details: 547 Elizabeth St, Melbourne. (03) 93284886

Hours of Business: till late

Rates: $80 plus tip

Age: mid 20s

Size: B cup

Nationality: Asian

Services Provided: happy ending

Value for money/Recommend: yes, as a fail safe

My Experience:

I fucking love being jerked off, but I want a good massage too.

I travel a bit for work and have been a punter in Syd, Melb, New York, Vegas, Miami, Hong Kong, Bangkok and Singapore

If the chick is mechanical and not into it, it'll take the bitch 30 mins to make me shoot. Fuck them, their sore arm is the price they pay for doing an average job.

If their good at it and make it fun, I blow in 5 mins.

Royal City is a safe bet. Sometimes the chick is sensational, other times average.

On my most recent trip I arrived about 1:30am and the place was basically deserted.

There are signs all over the place saying no sexual services - no one cares. You pay for the massage when you arrive -$80.

Book an hour long body massage. There are sauna facilities etc, I always like to shower, jump in the sauna for a while.

You walk out to the lounge, where the next available chick takes you upstairs to be massaged.

In this case, she was an average looking, slightly plump mid 20s chick. I figured the fact she was younger than usual would offset the fact she was average.

You lay down nude and she started massage my back with oil. I like the fact they are Asian because they don't talk that much.

The massage was quite good - firm, not sexual, but quite relaxing. After about 45 mins, she asked me if I wanted special massage.

I said yes, how much. She said a tip of $100. I said no, my maximum was $50. She tried to negotiate me higher, I just kept saying no, maximum of $50.

After about three attempts, she agreed and then squirted oil all over my cock and went to work.

She didn't undress and I didn't try to touch her.

I just make sure I let them know what I like by groaning when they do it right. She got the idea I like having my asshole rubbed as well, so she was jerking my cock and rubbing my asshole with her other hand.

After a while I blew and she cleaned me off with hot towels. It was all fine.

Then back to the shower.

She was hanging around the door of the change room so I gave her the $50 and she pissed off. I left.

In defence of the man,I think it's fair to say that a lot of the rub & tugs "ladies" around Melbourne have the same attitude to us blokes as Jake has to some of these ladies.We've all had them,the ones who just want you out the door as quick as possible so they can get into the next guy's wallet or the ones who expect top dollar for shit service.Or even the new breed of young ones who seem to think that what they have under their clothes is rarer than gold and therefore priced accordingly.I personally wouldn't use some of Jake's language but I don't think it necessarily makes him an a-hole.What he wrote is no different to a massage girl saying "I hate (insert relevant nationality) guys because they always smell bad" or "As soon as he came I kicked him out even though he had 10 minutes left".Just my 2 cents worth.

Sure TMT, some ladies can sometimes be dismissive and try to overcharge, but at a minimum let's just treat them with respect please. Though if you go in with the sort of attitude the a-hole above has displayed then you probably deserve poor service. I hope I never have to see a ML straight after some prick like that has been with her.

To be honest I didn't think the review was a bad one, and to a degree reflects my own attitude i.e. I get very pissed off after having paid good money to be tended to by someone who can't hide her disdain for me or the half-hearted job she's doing. I always treat the ladies I see with respect, but if they are going to take my money then I expect a certain standard of service in exchange. If a lady isn't keen on seeing me or has no intention of making me feel welcome then let me know beforehand so that I can save my money for someone who's worth it.

I agree 100%. I didn't think the review was bad either. There's been a hell of a lot worse on here. He gave a good honest account.

Other than asking for $100 for a HJ, I don't see any problem with the service she provided. Our reviewer is new here so perhaps, given the nature of this forum, he felt it would sound more "macho" to use that kind of language.

I am certain I would never refer to any woman like that in a review even if I felt it and I don't go into a session with a "fuck them" attitude.

I'm pretty sure that the OP didn't refer to her as that in person, rather that is his opinion of a working lady who takes his money in exchange for a service but knowingly gives a very poor service without giving a shit whether the client is enjoying it or not. I've paid good money to a few ladies who have had this same attitude and upon reflection I think back on those individuals as bitches also but that most definitely is not my overall opinion of working ladies, the majority of whom I have the highest respect for.

Eloquence and written word canbe expressive and canbe perceived as a window to ones character and attitude.. 

The OP has been advised of his use of "colourful" language.. 

As with most things respect is called for at all times.. Dare i say be empathetic as that pwl might be someone's mother, daughter, sister or family relative.. They all "work" for certain reasons.. That is to survive in this world.. 

This is not a warning or moral crusade but mutual respect..

Thank-you Andrew. And fellow punters, the point is not about whether the OP referred to the ML as bitch to her face or just to big note himself in this forum - the point is about respect to a fellow human being.

FFS, Sometimes people can be so precious. Harden up guys.  
I didn't read his review and think he was referring to anyone in particular using the word bitch. It was a generalisation in reference to a 5hitty massage/tug. 
IMO, the OP'er wrote a reasonable review, as I said, much better than half the ones i read in here.

Hahaha lofty... I've been told to harden up and been accused of being precious on this forum in the past but actually tend to wear it as a badge of honour. It is all a matter of respect. AB is absolutely correct.

We read plenty of reviews on this forum from guys with 'attitude'. Fair enough - we're all testosterone-charged macho-men... that's why we fuck around and then write up. No particular reflection on the OP, although for a first-up post he's a bit of a give-away.

But there's a pretty simple paradigm that runs inter-personal relationships. What you put out is exactly what you'll get back. It's not some new age touchy-feely crap nor is it rocket science. MLs and WLs have been around long enough to read a punter when he walks in the door - just like we think we read them. A bloke who swaggers in expecting the world and then whingeing because he doesn't get it... well, he just doesn't get it.

I can recall many a punt where my first impression in the door might say... walk. But experience tells me that a little bit of patient attention and 'vocal massage' can totally reverse the situation. As I've posted before, these women are working in a tough game. They all have their own reasons for being there. They deserve respectful treatment just as we all expect in our own work places. Give it out and you get it back in spades.

Don't get me wrong - if I get a bum wrap, I call it for what it is... as I did in a Lindfield review last week as it happens. No less respect for the girl - she just ought to be doing something else!

And no, it's not a moral crusade... just simple respect - common sense on human nature.

Royal City Massage Spa & Sauna - 547 Elizabeth St, Melbourne - 03 9328 4886

Person's Name: I asked for Lola and she was in   as she doesn't work here all the time, 
I also ask for Renee or Linda sometimes and another girl called Link ( thats how is was pronounced)

Establishment: Royal City Massage, Melbourne

Date of Visit: 16th May  2013

Contact Details: 547 Elizabeth St, Melbourne. (03) 93284886

Hours of Business: 1pm til 1am

Rates: $75 for 45 min hour maybe $65 for the 30 minute and $95 for the hour  they have other rates for VIP and members which differ but the above are the casual rates and include use of their steam room, Sauna and showers which is pretty good

Age:  late 20s or maybe early 30s

Size: C cup

Nationality: Asian - Chinese

Services Provided: massage - full body and happy ending with tit sucking

Value for money/Recommend: yes, fantastic massage as they use their feet and stand  on you while holding onto a rail, so if you like a  strong massage and back crack  yeah!!!  and the HJ is a great ending as well.

My Experience:

I have been here many times but this is the first time I have been since being a forum member and posting a review.

Most of the time if you don't ask for a particular girl you are allocated a girl by the person at reception, this has been a young guy who I have seen at reception the last few times that I have been there.

The facilities are great especially the Sauna and Steam room and there is a change room with lockers as you are given a key at reception so you can lock up your belongings.

There are 2 racks of silk shorts and gowns to put on when you are ready to go out to the waiting area in preparation for your massage, I have never bothered to put on the shorts and usually get undressed when I get there, have a shower to freshen up, slip some $$ in my gown pocket to take up to the room with me so I can pay the girl for extras.

As I come out of the mens change room and walk past reception into the waiting area where there are two large screen Tvs and lounge chairs for seating, you usually never have to sit down to wait if it is not busy and they will send you up the stairs to wait at the top where there a two chairs up there.

Lola comes up the stairs and greets me with a smile and shows me to her usual Massage room, these are quite nice with a professional massage table and bars on the ceiling so they can support themselves while they walk on your back and legs, for that great firm massage,

I lay down and she proceeds to put a towel on my back and then uses her hands to press down on my before she get up on the table and use her feet to press down on my back and shoulders and legs to give that proper Chinese massage, very good for those tired and tight muscles, she has been here long enough and I think some of these girls have had proper training based on how they massage you and the routine they go through.
After walking over me and cracking my back she take the towel down to my bum exposing my back and then puts oil on and commences to massage me,  it was a fantastic massage with oil and pressure, then she would proceed to move the town down to my legs and commence to massage my bum with her hands using oils and rubbing me and making me horny as hell
then she took the towel off my legs,, placing it on my back and commenced to massage my legs working way up to my upper thigh and inner crotch. she then used her hands to slide up inside my thigh and brush past my john and boys immediately making me hard
she did this on a number of times increasing the play and touching.
I lifted up my bum to give her better access and she responded in kind by touching me even more,

then she finished the back and legs and wiped me down the the towel to take off the excess oil,  asked me in a soft spoken voice to turn over.  puts a pillow under my head and then she proceeds to say do I want special massage and of course i say yes,  now the first time this was done with LOLA she asked how much I wanted to pay and I say $50  and she was fine with this, now she doesn't even ask she just proceeds to do the job on the flip which is great so no disappointment and when she teases when I am lying on my stomach, she does more teasing and foreplay with the legs and boys and eve grabs me from underneath, very sexy and sensual.

she is very god at HJ and now also allow me to take her bra strap off so I can get access to her titties and this time I sucked on them as well, nice n soft and tasty,

while she is working her magic with her hands on my John, she has never offered BJ or other services but I have been happy with the massage and RnT given the quality of the massage and the foreplay before the flip

She brings me to climax and then cleans me  up before continuing on the massage for the remainder of the hour, sometimes even going over by 10-15 minutes to ensure I have a great time and great massage as well.

She then finishes with a great head massage and then allows me to get up and get my gown on to go downstairs, I pay her the $$ and head back down to shower and change, 

I have seen a number of other girls here and the procedure is pretty much similar although the style of massage varies between girls and the type of sensual foreplay before the flip can differ as well,  I have also noticed the guys that didnt take up money with them paying the girls who are hanging around the door of the change room. giving the appearance  management may not be aware of the extras but not sure, in any case is a consistent and great service which is why i keep on coming back when in need of a great massage and RnT

Rates: $75 for 45 min hour maybe $65 for the 30 minute and $95 for the hour they have other rates for VIP and members which differ but the above are the casual rates and include use of their steam room, Sauna and showers which is pretty good


Age: Mid 20s


Size: C cup


Nationality: Asian - Chinese


Services Provided: Legit massage only


Value for money/Recommend: yes, if you want a first class massage only

My Experience:

I figured Sunday afternoon might be productive since there wouldn't be many punters, and cash flow might be sparse enough to encourage the girl. Nope! Tina is pretty cute, young enough, good English, training to be a masseuse during the week and only works Sat & Sunday. She seemed to be the only girl there apart from the receptionist.

It became obvious about the 30 minute mark that the 45 min was not going to end in anything other than a massage, but since it was so good, I stayed cool. At the end I told her that when I had come here before some of the girls had doe extras, and if I saw her again might she.

Just a brick wall "no".

So, now you know where you stand with the various chicks there boys!

Other than that - I like the whole set up - it reminds me of massage parlours in Hong Kong.......  :-)

Hi everyone - just a heads up.  I have been here a number of times, way before I discovered this forum.  Was ok for a quick massage and rub, but the place was a little dirty and run down.  Anyhow I drove past yesterday and I believe it has shut down.  As stated above, because it was open late (2am) was good for a late one, but even t 11pm it was closed.  Just some intel for you gents.

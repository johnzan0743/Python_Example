Some time ago I had a very pleasurable hour or so with nice lass here who called herself Amy and whilst I do prefer trying new unexplored territory going back there seemed like a good idea.

But alas she was not working today, however the girl Candy who answered the phone was more than pleasant so WTF, of I went.
Met at the door by Shiva a early 30 perhaps lass with a tidy look and ushered into the massage room, and discussed financials.

$150 for a double massage with HE, mmmmm is this nude. 
No No nude extra, I wanted to discuss so Shiva got Candy to negotiate further.
Shiva doesn't do nude but gives a good massage I am told and with nude for Candy $170 double for 30min. A bit steep but I hadn't had a double in so long why not.

I will say that I negotiated a 45 min session for a little extra and I think this was worthwhile. 

A great massage with intelligent conversation and a very good finish. 
Value....I thought so. When it's all said and done that was 100 each for 45 and just having 4 hands rummaging around your nooks and crannies was a turn on in itself.

Candy does a 4 hand with Amy and both nude would be better.
I didn't ask for extra extra so I am not sure if it's available or not.

WIR .....yes for a double with the afore mentioned.

It is helpful if your not lazy. I happened to have forgotten the number and can't be fucked looking it up but I did have the courtesy of given the information as I got it.
If you can't live with that then stiff shit.

I respect fellow punters as a rule but Your tone suggest I owe something like wasting my time when a little help them selves could be in order.

At the risk of repeating myself. locanto.....Melbourne ...massage...Uni student...or are you expecting me to do your work for you?

I guess what Toomuch was trying to say is that there have been a number of entries on Locanto using your description over the years, so it may not be obvious.

It helps if you use the standard template for your reviews.

 the way forums work best.

So for what it is worth, using the keywords you provided actually comes up with nothing of use in Locanto. If you were to substitute "Uni" with "college", then your luck changes. Now this did take me about 10 mins to pin down (and yes, I may not be the quickest at these things, but I am possibly not the slowest either!  ) So this is why we ask for contact details, and it is not because we are lazy...

Person's Name: Monica

Establishment: Formosa Belle Massage 0421174971 

Date of Visit: 13 June 2012

Contact Details/Address: Apartment on Swanston Street near Victoria Street

Hours of Business: 11AM - 9PM

Prices: $80 PH for lomi lomi

Age: 20's

Size/shape: Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity: PRC

Services: Lomi Lomi, Chinese massage only

Value for money/recommend?: Yes, for a great lomi lomi

My experience/comments: I thought I would give this place a try. They only do minimum 1 hour booking for lomi lomi because of the shower afterwards, which is a good thing because you really do need an hour to enjoy it properly.

I called them and was directed to the address, where I had to key in the number and then took the lift to the right floor. Monica showed me to the room with a proper massage table with waterproof cover. I undressed and remained facing down the whole time.

Monica was very pleasant, and looked nice in shorts and glasses. The lomi lomi was great. This place is totally legit. No extra's at all.

WIR? Yes, for a great lomi lomi.

Thanks for the review Toneman. Is this the place that was at 233 Collins Street?

Hey there Iva,

It certainly sounds like it. I gave them a call, and the voice sounded familiar. But have not had the time (nor inclination, after the disappointment that was 233 Collins St) to check

Hi Iva, I haven't been to Collins Street before. All I can say is that Monica gave me a great straight lomi massage.

My experience/comments:As a lomi lomi affectionado I gave this place a try.  Minimum 1 hour booking for lomi lomi and shower afterwards, the minimum time for a lomi lomi and because of the oil you need the shower.

I called them and was given the details on how to get there and was met by Monica who showed me to the room with a proper massage table with waterproof cover. I stripped off and laid face down on the table

Monica was in a pair of nice shorts and was pleasant in her nature. It was one of the best  lomi lomis I've had. This place is definitely legit.

WIR? Yes, always for a great lomi lomi!!!!!

Prices: $80 PH for lomi lomi

Age: 20's

Size/shape: Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity: PRC

Services: Lomi Lomi, Chinese massage only

Value for money/recommend?: Maybe

My experience/comments: I found this place by accident, while looking through a paper. Love lomi as well so gave them a call. Got directed to the place and the girl that greeted me was young and attractive, it wasn't Monica but I couldn't quite catch the name. I was led to a room with a massage table. Only thing I would say is that I went during the day and the room was REALLY bright. Kinda kills the mood. Stripped off, and proceeded to get a great Lomi Lomi massage. i thought more was on offer as I got an extension of time, but alas, there was nothing. 

WIR? Maybe, if I'm in the mood for Lomi.

Saw Monica on several occassional - nice personality and offers a great massage. It was very relaxing and if you like lomi lomi massage one of the best I have had. Strictly professioal and no extras on offer - I did approach the subject once but was flatly refused. If you are looking for  different massage and I can reccommend this place. I will go again even though a prefer a happier ending.

No, I am afraid this is not as easy at it sounds. I have had some very good extras from places that seemed legit and where I only had legit for a long time. I think most punters would have had similar experiences at one time or another.

What qualifies a legit place? A place where no one has ever experienced an extra? And what happens if you classify a place as legit then someone records a tug? Do you reclassify it on one report?

I went to this place the other week. The funniest part is the obsession with getting you to take off your shoes! You can't go more than one step into the appartment without them getting you to take off your shoes.

Once in the room and established that it is straight massage only I got my money back and left. They were ok about it. I just explained I wanted more than just massage.

The girl I met (can't remember her name sorry) was very attractive and wore the shortest shorts with fantastic legs. Thought it was promising, but she wasn't budging even for extra cash.

My experience/comments : 

I was walking down Queen Street with time to kill and noticed the flashing sign in the window. I realised then that those flashing signs are like what some of those ultra deep sea fish do to get food -- they have those lights dangling in front of their mouths to lure in unsuspecting fish, and this fish was unsuspecting (although I didn't know it at the time).

Got in to the place to find a very chilly woman on reception. Chilly both because of her numerous layers of coats, and also her frosty attitude. Paid my $40 for 30 minutes, hoping like hell it wasn't her. Went into the room, disrobed, and lay on the bed. In came another girl (Chrissie), very fit. Things were looking up! I asked for a soft sensual massage with no oil, and she put a towel over me. "No need for that," I said. "Yes there is," she said.

The next 30 minutes was a rough Thai massage. When I asked her to make it a bit more gentle, she switch from the sledgehammer to the crowbar. And then, "OK, that's it" before she left the room.

The rooms are partitioned only, don't go all the way to the roof. Warm enough, and seemed clean, if a little cramped in the room I was in.

I'll give this shop another go at some stage (benefit of the doubt, may have been that Chrissie was told it was a Thai massage), but not a great first experience.Anyone else had any luck here?

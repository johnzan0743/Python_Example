Person's Name : Amy

Establishment : Lotus Health Spa

Date of Visit : 21/9/11

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 9654 6635, 178 Collins St Melbourne (Basement level)

Hours of Business :  9:30am - midnight weekdays, not sure of weekend hours

Rates : $55/30 mins; $89/60 mins (although if you take a 30 min and then decide to extend it, it will cost you $105)

Age : late 20s/early 30s

Size/shape : Medium

Nationality or Ethnicity : New Zealander

Services Provided : straight massage, nothing more

Value for money/recommend? : Yes if you are just after a massage, no if you are after anything else (although $55/30 mins is fairly high rate for a straight massage anyway...)

My experience/comments : Saw an ad for this place, thought I'd give it a try. I rang first up, and all the usual hallmarks were there, husky voice on the phone, a bit evasive, encouraging me to come in and check it out. So I made a booking for midday, and headed in. You need to go to the end of the corridor and down a staircase.

When I got there and checked in, I figured that any extras were unlikely. The giveaways were the aromas and soft plucky music, as well as clear evidence of EFTPOS. When I said I was here for my massage, I was also given a loyalty card, which is unusual in the dens I normally frequent.

I had been booked in with Amy, who had nipped out for a bit to eat, so I was shown to the room. The rooms themselves are kind of cool -- underground, plaster finish, and curved roof. I was in the end room, which also had a skylight up to the footpath. Whilst I was waiting, the receptionist (who, BTW, was a real stunner) asked me if I wanted an Asian or Australian girl. I said I'd try the latter, and a few minutes later Amy popped in. In the meantime, a recce of the room had failed to find any other evidence, such as a tissue box, so not looking good.

I stripped off, and had the old towel go over the arse, so I settled in for what I figured would be a decent straight massage, and that it was. In fact, so good that I asked if I could extend for another 30 minutes, which was possible, albeit at a higher rate. Amy really got into a few knots, did some good works on the glutes although there was nothing sensual about her touch there at all. Leg work strictly avoided any brushing.

Time for the flip, and the towel went back. Seemed to be strictly legit, and as she was ending I asked if I could finish myself off (despite the lack of sensual massage I was sporting a decent boner under the towel), but she said no. That's cool, I respected that.

All in all, an excellent (if slightly pricey) legit massage. I would be interested to know if there are any masseuses here who do offer extras though, as I saw a couple of very good looking girls as I was leaving.

WIR? Not if I'm after a bit of relief, but if I'm after a decent massage in town, then yes.

My experience/comments : pass by this location and decided to go down the basement and checkout the prices and hopefully get a glimpse of the girls working there. YES, there are all very pretty! really pretty. there are taiwanese, japanese massage girls, university student looking. Alice was assigned to massage me, very friendly, wisper in your ears, talk to you very kindly and gently. massage the sensitive areas, inner thighs, breast was rubbing on my head, took off my underwear for me....gives u all the right hints....and then when ask for anything more she said no. only straight massage. i must say the massage here is very good, relaxing, with music playing. Alice is very pretty, nice fair skin and looks. dress very pretty too. 

she gave me her card asking to book her if i need regular massage. 

in my opinion, she makes you really relaxing, like a very good friend, some sort of a GFE. her hand stroking is pretty good too. only for massage. the place looks very clean, comfortable. class too.

My experience/comments : Popped in at lunch time for a nice massage, not expecting anything more. Was introduced to Tracey, who gave me an excellent 30 minute relaxation massages -- not too much oil. A little bit of chat, but not too much.

As mentioned earlier, this is a great CBD place if you want a legit massage, but not if you are after anything else.

My reason for posting this review is to say that Tracey gave one of the best legit massages I have received recently. If you are after one of those, then Tracey is probably worth a go

But nothing else on offer.

Does anyone had any experience where extras were offered here? 

The mamasan wear pretty hot, so do some of the girls. Were they trying to give you the hope and take it away?

Been there quite a few times, and I'd say this place is 100% legit.

Yes, the girls are hot, but I'm happy to go back for two reasons: the massage is good and so is the attitude. All the staff there (that I've met anyway) are friendly and chatty without being too chatty.

Shown into the room, much nicer than expected. Massage started, towel on, and was overall excellent, worked the back and upper legs, with the odd touching a bit higher up. PLenty off pressure on the buttocks as well. Was quite difficult to tell if there'd be anything other than standard massage on offer, but will definitely return to have another go as it was quite a relaxing experience.

I gave this one another try last week. Nice massage from a lovely girl (Kristal). She was pretty, friendly, chatty, and knew how to massage. At the end she gave my stomach, an area often neglected by most masseuse, a good massage too. But that was it for the front of the body. A good place to go for a proper massage.

 Misleading advertising?
				
Post Content: 
This place has advertised in gumtree:





			
				Relaxation and sensual lomi lomi full body massage. 

caring and friendly, let me help you relax 
exchange massage ok. 

certificate III in beauty and relaxation massage 

PRICES 
half hr - $55 
45 min - $75 
1 hour - $89 

BOOK LAYLA, MON - FRI. 

PH: 96546635 

ADDRESS - 178 COLLINS STREET, MELBOURNE 3000, LOWER GROUND LEVEL. 

state " THIS IS NOT A SEXUAL SERVICE'
			
		

The reference to "exchange massage" suggests that the client can massage the masseuse (presumably for an additional fee) and that the masseuse will be naked.  That is not what one would expect in a straight massage.

Other words in the advertisement such as "sensual" and "full body" also suggest something more than a straight massage.

Of course, the advertisement also specifies "this is not a sexual service", but that sort of disclaimer seems to be standard practise for advertisements for massage in gumtree, presumably required by gumtree.  Even providers that are known to give extras include that diusclaimer in their advertisements.

A similar advertisement for this establishment has appeared in Craigslist:





			
				FULL BODY SENSUAL RELAXATION MASSAGE BY THE LOVELY LAYLA.

20 YEAR OLD, BLONDE, AUSTRALIAN GIRL

LET ME LOOK AFTER YOU

1/2 HR - $55
45MIN - $75
1 HOUR - $89

MUTUAL EXCHANGE MASSAGE OK.

BOOK , LAYLA

MONDAY -TO- FRIDAY

96546635

ADDRESS - LOWER GROUND LEVEL 178 COLLINS STREET , MELBOURNE 3000.

NOT A SEXUAL SERVICE.
			
		

That advertisement is even more suggestive, with a description of the "lovely Layla", although it contains the same disclaimer about not being a "sexual service".

The expectations aroused by the advertisements, with their suggestive wording, appear to be entirely belied by the experiences posted on this thread, which describe an entirely straight massage.

So what is the consensus of opinion?  Is this place engaging in misleading advertising, designed to attract clients by arousing expectations that will not be fulfilled?  Is the "lovely Layla" agreeable to an "exchange massage" an entirely fictitious person?

I would also like to ask a semantic question.  I was under the impression that the wording "not a sexual service" meant that only hand relief was on offer, not oral or full service, and a purely straight massage was indicated by the wording "strictly non-sexual service".  What are your thoughts?

Further to my previous message, I would like to add that I do not live in Melbourne, but will be visiting there later this month.  I was going through the online advertisements (gumtree, locanto, Craigslist) looking for full-body massage with hand relief in the CBD.  I also bought the 10-day access to this Forum with a view to getting some client feedback that might supplement and correct the possibly misleading information given in the advertisements.  I might say that this Forum has been very helpful in that regard.

There is no denying the adverts are aimed at enticing gullible men (such as I) to pay them a visit. So there is a good case for your argument that they are misleading Paunchy. However, if you raised this with them I expect they'd just point to the "not a sexual service" disclaimer. 

Give it a try when you are here. You never know your luck. But from my experience it isn't even a teasing massage. Just a good massage from an attractive girl and that has it's place.

Couple of points here. First, in Victoria at least you'll get the "Not a sexual service" disclaimer no matter what. Second, having been a regular here for a while, it's just a straight massage. The people who run it have had customers approached by council officers after they leave, asking what kinds of services were on offer. Just wondering if it shoudl be moved to the appropriate thread admins?

Popped in to this place recently after seeing their suggestive advertising and came away disappointed but suppose should not have been on basis of above posts...nothing seems to have changed.

Massage was fair at best by Layla, Aussie, not slim.

All very straight, she was fully dressed, towel over bum, no tickle of the tackle, "no sexual service" signs. Did not bother to ask about extras as vibe was not good.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 9654 6635, 178 Collins St Melbourne (Basement level)

Hours of Business : 9:30am - late weekdays, not sure of weekend hours

Rates : $49/30 mins

Age : Good question. Maybe late 20s?

Size/shape : Slim, lips bigger than the love child of Mick Jagger and Steve Tyler, rack in the same proportions

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : sensual straight massage, nothing more

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

Was in town, rang and someone was free so in I went. The usual receptionist was there -- today she was wearing a purple outfit that looked as though it had been put through a bread slicer at a bakery and white CFM boots. What was also apparent was that she was not wearing a bra 

Went into a room with a masseuse called Aris (I think), slim PRC lass. She got me set up, and then Moya came in. Wow. Asked for a soft sensual massage with no oil, thinking maybe the duck could be broken here! No luck, although I had a wonderful 30 minute massage. Moya knows how to do sensual, and she actually listened to my request for not too much oil.

So, as usual for this place: a good-high quality massage from a young attractive masseuse with no extras on offer.

WIR? Yes, for a nice massage by a looker.

Dropped in as I was passing by and Nicky directed me to a room with Mika. Mika's tall, leggy, and gorgeous. She gave a sensational massage, which had me at full mast on the flip. No towel, she was mildly amused at my boner, and gently said, no to a HJ. But she said with a shrug of her shoulders, if you want to work on it yourself, feel free. So I did, and she cleaned up afterwards. Nice young lady, top massage. But DIY option only.

Size/shape : Mika: tall slim and leggy. Joanna:slim, B cups, athletic legs.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Taiwanese / PRC

Services Provided : sensual straight massage, nothing more

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

Went in late one evening, only tow ladies on. Mika suggested I try new girl Joanna. Went to the room, and decided to ask straight up if there was anything extra on offer. No go. I asked if she and Mika could do a 4 handed massage. Sure, she says, let me go and check. Sure thing; that'd be $90. Handed over the two lobsters, and in a few minutes we were all set to go.

Well.

Mika can sure do a great sensual massage, but I reckon Joanna's even better. 30 minutes of bliss, followed by a DIY with the permission of both girls.

Yes, a HJ would be nice, but when you have two attractive women paying you so much attention, well, 

WIR? Yes.

My experience/comments : 

It was pissing down with rain this afternoon, so I thought I'd see it out downstairs at Lotus. Joanna was the only girl available, so I went for a 30 minute session with her (having seen her previously I knew it would be fun). There were a few other girls heading home at 5:30, so they were not available, but also look very nice.

For my $49, I got a wonderful sensual massage; I was totally aroused and aching for a HJ -- definitely not on, but DIY was OK. Joanna's a nice person, not too chatty, but happy to talk if conversation is initiated. 

Claims to have had no formal massage training, but 3 days on the job with her other boss (apparently she works in a place in Hampton) and one of her customers gave her instruction on how to do sensual massage.

WIR? Yes.

Thank you cl-dean.

I can't see why it doesn't belong in the Therapeutic massage forum either.

If it turns out that the latest reports (of HE) are confirmed by reviews (a 2 line post is not a review), it can be moved back.

Don't feel victimised folks because this is by no means the worst thread as far as two line posts go, but posting a review by completing the template is also an opportunity for you to establish a connection with the lady.

This may put the hearing of any appeals in a favourable light.

You need name, nationality, size for your template so what better opportunity to practise distinguishing yourself from the crowd by starting conversation along those lines. There are some ladies that aren't interested in anything but getting you out of there,  but most people understand that conversation helps time pass. Hearing something interesting, even more so.

Probably playing it straight as you can is helpful.

'I thought you were a Thai lady but most of the ladies I saw in Patapaya (whatever) were .... (whatever) whereas you are slimmer (whatver)'

You can see why I got 'most likely to strike out with a certainty' but you probably get the picture.

In jaxons' defence... I know from talking to Nikki (who manages / owns the place) that in the past if she finds out that a girl has been offering extras then that girl is gone. So, I don't doubt jaxons' claim, but I expect that Alice is not much longer for the doors of Lotus.

The thing with this place is, it's populated by almost exclusively by young hotties, they give excellent massages, but I get the feeling that the owners are determined to run it as a legit service.

If Nikki is so keen to keep and run a legit establishment, then stop running the ads. We all agree that the ads have a tone designed to entice, giving the impression that more than a massage is on offer. So she has only herself to blame IMHO. Then again, she probably knows exactly what she is doing when posting those ads, purposefully using certain words, and photos, she seems to have some marketing skills. :-) 
Compare it to the ads that holiday calm post now, no illusions there - you will not be getting anything extra, just a massage.

Chalk, all due respect, but I was under the impression that this forum does not operate like the other one where cryptic clues are used for massage places and ML names. Was that not the point of the membership re structure? I need some incentive to share my experiences, and a review without a name is no incentive.  In fact, about a month ago I commented that a review without a name is useless to the rest of us, one of your fellow moderators agreed with me,  and even posted that he agreed.  Now you pretty much reprimand me for making the same observation. I'm sure I'll lose brownie points now, but seriously, where is the consistency. I'll gladly post heaps of reviews without names or details if that is accepted towards our post count now.

Dropped in here and had a massage with Alice. Pretty young and slim Taiwanese girl. Great sensual massage and friendly girl but she said "don't do" when I asked about extras. However Alice was attractive and her massage is what I enjoy (apart from a HE) so I would return. Did not ask her if I could DIY. Noticed some other young pretty girls there.

Dropped in on spec; Nicky recommended Jess, so I went for 30 minutes with Jess. Wow, what a package. I asked for a sensual massage, and this lass knew how to deliver! One of the best 30 minute teases I've ever had, from a reasonably attractive girl with a killer bod in an outfit that showed it off. As per usual, DIY finish, and then ended up with a great head massage from Jess. Ended up going 10 minutes over, but no clock watching. Absolute ripper. Jessie works Wednesdays only.

Did a great Lomi Lomi, no, no extras, but very sensual, and a very attractive woman. Really decent Lomi Lomi massage. No extras here, but if you are after a great massage, well worth it Minal works Mondays only, but indicated this may change, so best to ring ahead and check.

I'll be back for a full hour of this!

Yet again Nikki produces the goods: a hot young thing who gives a great sensual massage. I'd spied Eva after leaving the session with Minal, and rang through on the offchance she was on -- she was, and I would be in the area -- so I made a booking. I was shown to the room by ALice, was lying on the table when Eva came in. Something was wrong with her music player, so she apologised and said she'd be back in a minute. One the way out, she ran he nails lightly down my arse and inner thigh... what happened when she came back was the I received an exceptionally sensual massage from an absolute hottie with a stunning rack. Nothing was exposed (unfortunately), and Eva was quite OK with a DIY finish on my part...

Dropped in to see Alice but she was off so saw Mika instead. Directed into a back room by Mika, off she went to get a dvd player while i got undressed. Went butt naked and lied on the bed facing down waiting for Mika.

Nice sensual massage, standard affair with nothing too special. She was dressed in a short skirt with revealing low cut top but nothing was ever exposed. Her hands roamed all over my body and it felt good.

On the flip, I tried my luck and asked for extra services but she said she does not do it but does not mind DIY, to which I obliged. Finished off myself and she wiped me down with a towel and sent me on my way with a smile

Horrible experience. Joyce was friendly, but that was about it. Very chatty girl, talked about everything and was quite easy to get along. Unfortunately that was as far as it got. Her massage was one of the worst i've had for a long time. Only concentrated on my shoulder for the whole 30 minutes. No pressure whatsoever. No flip. After the shoulder 'rub', she finished off and said Thank you. Baffled, I asked whether there were extras, or even a DIY option but no success. Woudldn't have been so disappointed if the massage was at least good!

My experience/comments : 

I was in town with time to spare, so rang and Nikki said Eva was working. After my previous good experience with her, I made a booking and was there within 15 minutes.

Ye Gods.

Eva was wearing this fantastic tangerine one piece dress. Nice low cut decolletage allowed the world to appreciate her golden orbs (regrettably not freed), and it was short enough to show a nice bit of leg without being so short it was sluttish.

Eva remembered me from last time and I drifted off into bliss for about 30 minutes whilst she massaged my back, legs, and crack. Come the flip, and the sensual massage continued. I was at full mast, and finished myself off while Eva kept massaging. Very limited touching on the outside was OK. Eva gave me an excellent and thorough wash down with hot towels, and I was on my way to enjoy lunch and the rest of the day.

Eva said that she works Mondays and Wednesdays here.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

I was in the area so popped in; Alice was available. Got a lovely sensual rub. She does this thing where she kind of hitches up your leg and rings your upper thigh right next to the sack and old fella. God it felt wonderful. Come the flip, and I was able to DIY was a fair about of touching on the outside of clothes. Alice is a gem, only going to be here for a few more months apparently. Not sure which days she works. Can highly recommend.

Also, I've noticed that there seems to be three shifts in this place now: a morning shift; changeover between 1 and 2 in the afternoon, and a changeover again between 5 and 6. I *think* this means they are staying open a bit later.

Services Provided : Sensual massage, one of the best yet!

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

Nikki has done it again! I went in, and she recommended Yuki -- new girl, first shift, first client! Yuki is a slim, maybe C-cup busty lass with long dark hair and wide innocent eyes. Her English is pretty good, which makes it funny that she's here to study English... leaving aside the massage for a minute, we had a really good chat about Taiwanese nationalism (history and current day issues)

THe massage itself, wow. I never like too much oil; Yuki used a small amount, in just the right places! She did this amazing Lomi Lomi style underneath massage, but circling her hands around the top of the thighs, wow! Flipped over with a massive hard on...

Would highly recommend Yuki; at the moment as she is new, she is not sure of what shifts she will be having.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 9654 6635, 178 Collins St Melbourne (Basement level)

Hours of Business : 9:30am - late weekdays, not sure of weekend hours

Rates : $49/30 mins

Age : 30s maybe, seemed to be a little older

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Panamanian

Services Provided : Wonderful sensual massage, plus the offer of more...

Value for money/recommend? : Maybe

My experience/comments : 

Was keen to check out Ash, who I bumped into in the foyer a few weeks ago, but apparently she's quite ill, and Nikki is not sure when she'll be back. Nikki suggested Paula the Panamanian (lets be honest, sounds like someone out of a D-Gen skit), so I said, sure why not. Handed over the readies, and met Paula. Friendly, chatty lady, over here studying English.

She's a little older than a lot of the ladies here. Nice trim figure with a bust that I suspect is not her own, but I never got a chance to find out... to cut to the chase, Paula provided a rippingly good sensual massage where she used minimal oil, but really used her body as well as her hands. It got me massively turned on, and I came to the flip sporting a massive boner. Paula allows some limited touching outside her clothes. On the flip, just for the hell of it I enquired as to extras, and she indicated that she'd be willing to do a HJ -- fully clothed -- if I parted with a pineapple. I declined (mainly because all I had on me was $50 which was needed for lunch!), but it's good to know...

I'd see Paula again, as even though she's not as hot as a lot of the women in the stable here, her massage was excellent. Paula is currently working Wednesdays.

Hours of Business : 9:30am - late weekdays, not sure of weekend hours

Rates : $49/30 mins + extras

Age : 30s

Size/shape : Medium build

Nationality or Ethnicity : French/Spanish

Services Provided : Massage +

Value for money/recommend? : Perhaps

My experience/comments : 

I rang to see if Ash was working (she wasn't, suspect she won't be back, which is a shame) but this thick accented voice on the phone had me coming on down to check out this lady. Beemea is an interesting lady who is in Melbourne on holiday for a few weeks. I asked for a soft sensual massage, and got an OK medium rub. This is going to sound weird, but it was also a caring massage -- she seemed interested in how I was enjoying it. On the flip, I asked (seeing as she's both new and short-term), and to my surprise I got an affirmative. +$70 got me a HJ plus also the discovery that she has nipple piercings. 

Look, it wasn't the best massage in the world, but it was affectionate. 

She is only in town for a few more weeks, according to her. Not for everyone, but for a bit of fun, and to actually get extras in this place, it was worth it.

I know that apparently the girls who offer extras are often given the flick, but as she's heading off in a matter of weeks, I felt it was OK to let fellow mongers know.

Beemea is Wednesdays only.

As an aside, Nikki was looking quite delicious as well...

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

Was in town for work, so dropped in during the lunch break. Nikki said everyone's busy but a new girl had popped out for lunch, rang her to come back. In the meantime, Nikki showed me to the room, and I waited. Eventually in came Sophie, dressed for the Melbourne cold, apologized for the delay and said she'd be back in a minute. True to her word, so returned a couple of minutes later... transformed. Wearing a tight little one piece, leaving not much to the imagination. I asked for a sensual massage.

Sophie's massage skills are not great, but when you've got that fabulous rack (unfortunately clothed) being squashed into your back (or face later on) what's not to enjoy.Given the body language, suspect that more may be on offer, but perhaps not here. Sophie indicated that she also works at Orchid in Lonsdale St... will have to try her out there 

Sophie's English is pretty good, really lovely personality, and a killer bod. A little more practice on the massage and we have a nice one here.

 My experience/comments : Wheres d-clean gone?    After meeting so many girls this girl got me.  The smell of oil took my breath away as I walked down to the basement.   No receptionist, but a girl with an odd look came out with green dress and leg warmers.  Didn't do much for me, then she pointed around the corner for me to meet a chinese girl.     On her mobile of course,  lovely face with nice lips, long hair and fake eye contact lenses.  Black shorts and black stockings with white t-shirt

Size 10, well built girl with strong looking arms and at 20 she just did it for me.   She used her knuckles on my shoulders and neck and it hurt, so we changed to a sensual massage.    She alternated between soft and medium and did a great job.  She seemed to have a clumsy personality when I met her, but wasn't overly talkative during massage.  I did ask her if she has worked elsewhere and she said "no".Not a bad massage for her first time.

She told me she would not provide privates outside of here, I asked as I was very attracted to her.   Not a bad girl to spend half and hour with

First day she told me, straight into a hard massage.  First stroke she leaned over my back with her white t-shirt rubbing against my back

I was passing through with some time to spare, and decided to drop in. Eva greeted me at the door, the usual long time no see, come in for a massage, etc. Headed in, and got a nice sensual massage, just what the doctor ordered. A lovely smile from Eva as I flipped, and for the hell of it, I asked if anything extra was on offer. For $80 I could get a topless HE. With Eva! Yes please. Awesome set of tits, although once the clothes come off you discover that Eva is a larger lass. Rules of engagement were touching OK, anything involving the mouth not so. Her HJ technique was excellent as well (not as good as Gigi's at Sayabadee though), and was complemented by a fair amount of dirty talk about what she and her boyfriend get up to -- she's apparently quite adventurous. The boyfriend means this is as far as she's willing to go as well...

Wow, after all this time, finally cracked it with Eva. And it's mighty fine to see those wondrous orbs unleashed -- lucky boyfriend.

WIR? There is better value elsewhere, but Eva's a nice person and has a great rack. Won't be a regular but an occasional treat.

Date of Visit : 21 Nov 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 2/94 Elizabeth St

Hours of Business : 10 till late

Rates : $80.00 for the hour + $40 for tug

Age : Early 30's I guess

Size/shape : 10 B

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

Services Provided : Great massage and above average HJ

Value for money/recommend? : If you are feeling like spoiling yourself.

My experience/comments : I have been here once before with Della (she fits the description of "Amy" below". That was purely legit - and because she's not my type (I'm a waif guy), I didn't push it any further. However, horny as hell, and it's local, so I thought I'd try again - especially given that reviews from fellow punters gave me hope. Nice one guys!  ;-)

I booked Minako over the phone - the name sounded familiar - and lo and behold, as I stepped in there was the same girl who I had seen at SS Sth Melb about 10 days ago! I knew what I was in for - I knew she drives a hard bargain, and she can be a little frosty - but I knew I was in for what I wanted.

Initially a great massage in a very clean establishment - altho I didn't see the "spa" anywhere!

Plenty of TT and when the time came she wanted $50 for a HJ and $100 for nude. Much more than she had charged at SS. I knew what her body looks like - didn't need to see that - talked her down to $40 - a bit pricey, but man she knows how to handle a cock and everything near it!  ;-)

Hot towel rub down after, shower offered credit card accepted.

Thia girl is in it for the money - but she earns it!

Person's Name : JoJo

Establishment : Lotus Health Spa

Date of Visit : 11/2/15

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 2/94 Elizabeth St

Hours of Business : 10 till late

Rates : $50/30 min + $30

Age : 20s?

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Massage (sort of) and HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes.

My experience/comments : I was in the area after catching up with a former workmate, so rang and spoke with Nikki. They have five girls on, two are now free, so I said, I'll be in. "Ah, but wait she says, all the rooms are busy". I'm assuming it was shift handover hence the 5 girls for 3 rooms, but Nikki seems to be doing OK running her business, so who am I to make suggestions... anyway, she says, ring back in 5 minutes, so I do that and a room is free -- Paula and JoJo are also free. I've seen Paula before so I ask for JoJo, and in I go. Nikki is there, smiling as ever and wearing the usual kind of outfit that is wonderfully revealing.

It was very busy in there; another customer was leaving, and out of the room pops Eva -- now known as Sasha (have I mentioned that before?). Anyway, JoJo is a new girl, it's her first day. She's thin, (I prefer a bit more on the frame, but life's about difference, right?) has a tattoo on her right ankle and one on her left shoulder, but seemed happy enough to come in as I was undressing. The usual not too much oil please, and we were away with a 2-3 minute back caress (not sure I'd call it a massage) where I also got to test the waters on her legs (she was standing at my head). No objection to me caressing her legs (good sign), and then she moved to the lower back where she checked that it was still there before moving onto my bum and undertaking an excellent in-and-under sack attack!

By and by I was on all fours and she was reaching around, then she pulled me up (so I was on my knees) and pulls herself close, fondling the old boy and the sack from two different directions, nuzzling in against me. I'm ready for a lie down, and JoJo proceeds to give me a sublime 20 minute hand job. This was one out of the box. There was no clothing removal, but she was happy for me to feel her arse up her short shorts. But the hand job was amazing. One hand, two hand, varying speed, varying pressure, a weird movement around the circumference I've never experienced before, it was great!

Afterwards she got a hot towel and cleaned me up. JoJo was happy to accept $30 tip. She had worked at a place in Glen Iris (don't know which one) and has been in Oz 6 months studying English. Not fully sure of her days yet, but she believes it will be Mon - Wed.

Excellent VFM, and can recommend.

[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments :  [/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]I found myself having finished an early meeting on a Friday and felt like a punt.  I recalled this place near the corner of Elizabeth and Collins so I looked up the details and went up to level 2.  [/COLOR]
[COLOR=#333333]A chubby girl was at reception and seemed friendly enough.  I had heard about Jasmine, however, she wasn't available so she highly recommended Crystal.  Crystal is an absolute stunner, the type that you would definitely check out if she was walking down the street (she looks quite elegant but sexy at the same time).[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]She asks me what kind of massage I would like so I say firm to begin with and relaxing towards the end.  She begins a very nice massage, she's obviously been taught properly.  She is quite friendly and we chat about all sorts of things.  She doesn't mind me putting my hands around her hips whenever possible.  After the occasional light brushing between the legs (not touching the balls as such), she asks me to flip around.

I caress her hips an she smiles and asks if I'm happy with the massage and asks if there's anything that she can do to make it even more enjoyable...bingo!  She says that she would do a clothed HJ for $50 or topless for $80 HJ or $100 for nude HJ.
She wouldn't negotiate on the fully nude, however, I'm a tit man so I was happy to negotiate $70 for a topless HJ.  Her technique was very nice and she was happy to have her tits played with (but she did say that she doesn't like it when guys get rough, I told her that I'm a soft caress kind of guy...haha).  It didn't take long before she got me there and thoroughly cleaned me up.

I noticed some of the other girls there and there seemed to be some real beauties, might have to return :-)[/COLOR]

Person's Name : Jenny

Establishment : Lotus Health Spa

Date of Visit : 12/3/15

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 2/94 Elizabeth St

Hours of Business : 10 till late

Rates : $50/30 min + $80

Age : 20s

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Viet

Services Provided : Extremely sensual massage + nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes.

My experience/comments : 

I dropped in on the offchance that someone was free, and as it happened, all 3 girls were free: Chloe (formerly Krystal), Jenny, and either Sabrina or Selina. Nikki is changing the names of the girls so much these days that it's hard to know who is who (it's like that scene from the movie "Analyse This" where the mob boss says, "Some of you may know me as Jimmy the Noodle, others know as The Red hand, still more know me as Mario the Spicy Currito". But I digress). This does however make it difficult to come in here based on a recommendation, as the names change.

Got into the room, Jenny came in -- a slim package in tights and shorts and a black halter top. Quite pretty, and clearly well toned. Apparently she is only recently back after a break, and used to work at the old place at 178. I asked for a soft massage with no oil, and Jenny proceeded straight to my head and gave me a wonderful light, nail-heavy, massage around my back, flanks, and bum.She was happy for me to feel her legs on the outside, and I suggested that she might be more comfortable out of her clothes.

"Sure," she says. "$80, including HJ."

I accepted (payment at end was OK, which is nice) and she then gave a lovely luxurious body to body massage. She has a small rack with slender nipples, and a tight bum, shaved puss. She finished me off with a lovely hand job.

Can highly recommend, and will return. Whilst $80 might seem high for a nude HJ, she's a real stunner, and I'd rather pay the $80 extra for one massage with Jenny that (say) $40 for two nude massages with old boilers elsewhere.

At this stage Jenny's timetable is unclear but she expects to be working Thursdays and Fridays.

Dropped by on the off chance today.
On the entry Nicki (boss) is sitting at the front door reception and three girls are nearby seated in the reception.Reception area is very tight 
No doubt about Nicki.She is one big girl in boobs and body but she is a very sexy dish.i always ask if she will massage "next time" is the reply.Reason is to keep the work up to the girls.love to give her a try.
She  is seated at reception in a flimsy black silk very,very  short dress .it is up around her crotch and a good  view for all.Big smile,big body,big revealed boobs and she knows it..
Into reception flashes a beautiful dish in short tight skirt and very good looking IMO.
She is 25 years from Malaysia,although her looks are a little European She has long black hair,big boobs and glorious arse in tight short  dress and great looks.
My lucky day boys.
I book 1 hr at $70  for this girl.In to a small well appointed clean room strip off and prop on the table side in my jocks.
As she walks in I drop the jocks and move to the table .She looks at me and says "nice one" Her name is Crystal.
Hmm this is looking really good .i lie down star fish and she moves her head up low to mine .What is on the menu? I say
No real response just a big smile and little kiss on the ear for me.
She starts a slow relax massage on the back,which is very enjoyable .At about the 10 min. mark her hand slides unannounced under my  crutch and starts to massage the boys and the shaft whilst I am lying face down . I lift and she keeps going Wow.
I am keen to turn over and do so asap.There is no towel and I lie back for a continuance .She raises the issue of $ and I say $50 for nude HJ . Her response is that she can do ,but not at that $ That sum will give me HJ and touch outside .Hmmm
She wants $100 .i tell her that is  very expensive but will do on this first time. All the while I am thinking one would pay a fortune for her as an escort without complaint.
So,it is nude but " no fingers inside" .what can a guy do.it is only money.
Ok for me.
She peels off the short tight dress and reveals a really beautiful white (well covered) body ,but a good figure ,big well formed boobs ,rounded arse nice stomach ,shaved puss. ,very smooths soft skin ; in other words pretty near perfect.
To go withit ,she  has a great face and smile that would light up your TV and  her demeanor is GF .light kisses .phew this is great.
She settles into a slow gentle tug and stands up close so I can explore.Pretty soon I am exploring the outside of that shaved Puss with nice strokes and she does not object whilst also tackling around the crack of a beautiful arse .i am thinking that this is like a magazine playmate 
We get to where  we are aiming with about 10 to go she is in no hurry though and she is encouraging me to the next appointment with her , telling me about herself etc.i must say too that the tug was first class .just right pressure and feel.
Overall one really good punt with one beautiful friendly girl
On the way out I spotted  a girl I had reviewed from 77 Davis Ave Sth Yarra "mui mui " says Nicki ( I called her then Muili)
She was fromTaiwan and also  very pretty.Nicki you have some good talent here
Place is however very small compared to her former shop at 178 Collins st , but the performance of the girls here far out weighs that place where you struggled for any extras.
Certainly return

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Value for money/recommend? : Ok.

My experience/comments : 

Visited this place in the afternoon before Easter break - went to Level 2 and opened the door slowly.
Mamasan was sitting at the receptionist (geez - large tits! I wish she'll do the massage) when I came in. She welcomed me and 
ushered me to room at the back. Soon after, Erica came in, early 20s, shoulder length wavy hair, slim, dark/toned skin and quite pretty - 
looks like bit Indian/Malay and spoke well English. 

In the middle of massage I asked her if she could also do extras.  Yes was the answer - nude HJ for $90. 
Sheesh..that was too much for nude HJ but since it was one day before Easter break, and she's young - I thought ok just for this time. 
So then she took off her clothes revealed A cup sized boob and shaved/neatly trimmed pussy - 
Hand job was good & enjoyable while my hand roamed on her everywhere - bit pussy play (outside) and her small tits until I blew.

WIR : maybe - young & quite fun 
Bit high for just HJ & nude. I'd like to try other girls first.

Date of Visit : 27 April

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Level 2, 94 Elizabeth St, 0488041250. Also advertises on Wechat

Hours of Business : 10am-10pm (earlier on weekends I think)

Rates : $80 for an hour

Age : 23

Size/shape : size 8, 160cm, A/B cup, slim but not skinny. Beautiful fair/pale skin. Very cute. Looks Japanese 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Hong Kong Chinese

Services Provided : massage plus HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, gorgeous sweet and cute girl

My experience/comments : Decided to try as is in the cbd and easy to get to. Arrived and only two girls on and fortunately was allocated the cuter of the two (the other girl was Minako who did not look so attractive and looked 35+). Into the room and stripped off and waited for Kiki to return. Asked up front if extras were on offer and was told HJ and touching outside of clothes. I said nude would be great but she said she doesn't do. Massage commenced which was fairly routine with no real sensual brushes. Engaged in some friendly light chit-chat with Kiki and she started to relax more and became quite smiley (gorgeous smile she has). I decided to initiate the flip and suggested she dispense with the massage and concentrate on my cock. She smiled and said ok. Great technique and she seemed to enjoy what she was doing. I asked again about nude or topless and she again said sorry don't do. By this stage she was very relaxed and the conversation was easy. She seemed to enjoy giving the HJ and working my cock and balls and much more as well! The build up was long and slow, just what I like. Once we were getting close to time I gave her the signal to take me all the way. After I exploded she went and got some hot towels to wipe we down. All up a great HJ from a cute and delightful girl. As she was wiping me down and we chatted further she said she also works at Sakura on Lygon street. While she had said yes to a HJ nothing has been mentioned about $$. At the end I asked her how much she expects and she simply said whatever you'd like to give me. Given that I'd enjoyed the time, she'd been very sweet and given a great HJ I passed her $50.

My experience/comments : 

In the area, had an unpleasant dentist visit coming up, decided to get some pleasure out o fate day, so dropped in here on spec. Only Helen available -- thin chick, quite good looking. Got into the room, she came in as I was finishing undressing. As I hopped on the table I asked about extras -- no I don't do any. OK, that's cool.

What then occurred was a reasonably good medium-hard massage, but with no interest in talking or interaction. Unsure if it is in her nature, or because I asked about extras. First time in a long time that Nikki has had someone below par.

Hours of Business : 10am till 10pm

Rates : 50$ 30 mins

Age : 27

Size/shape : 7

Nationality or Ethnicity : South Korea

Services Provided : massage

Value for money/recommend? : it was ok

My experience/comments : I popped in here today after booking Jenny last fri, and she didn't turn up.  I arrived around 1pm, and was greeted by 2 girls, one sitting at the desk, looking very pretty, and I asked "jenny", and she replied "yes".  I told her I booked her last week.  She said sorry, took me to a room , and I waited for her to return. Jjenny's hair is auburn coloured, lovely stricking facial features, between thin and solid,wearing tights with string at the top to tie them up, and a tight black top.   Small amount of belly exposed and just a small amount of fat in this region.

I was anticipating things as per the last review of her.  She poured oil onto her hand, rubbed her hands together, and for about 8 minutes massaged my back, and neck. No tickle tackle.  Another 7 odd minutes of massage onto bum and legs, using good pressure, and again no teasing.  No dialogue between us other than a couple of light moans from me.  Fearing time was of the essence I asked her if she did an extra service, and I was told with a smile "no".

She then continued for another few mins before racing out to get a hot towel.  After she wiped most of the oil off, I requested she massage my front legs, and she accepted.   She did a good job on this area, really digging her hands into what muscle is connected to my lower leg structure.

Jenny then went to massage my guts but I stopped her.  She then wiped most of the oil off my front, and told me im now clean.  I then said to myself, clean physically but am I clean spiritually lol.   Jenny may have denied extras due to a period or because I booked her unsighted and was suspicious, but in the end I wasn't overly bothered, as the session just didn't have enough spice.  As they say ymmv.

My experience/comments : 

After missing out at Queen St, I thought I would drop in here on spec to see who was on offer. Krystal had just been booked, and Jenny was free. Today Jenny provided just a straight massage -- good as always. She was suffering a very bad cold, so was not in the mood for extras. Apologised repeatedly toward the end of the session, and as I left she had spoken to Nikki and was packing up to go home. I'll not count this one against her, as she was sick and has always provided good service in the past.

Upshot for me though was $105 spent today, for blue balls!

Rates : $50/30 mins + $50 extra

Age : 20s

Size/shape : slim, fairly attractive, big bust

Nationality or Ethnicity : Vietnamese

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Okay

It's been a long time between punting but following a recent breakup, I've been back on the scene. This place was convenient and reviews seemed ok. I turned up without an appointment and a skinny but busty girl named Jasmine was at reception. Paid for half an hour massage and when showed to the room, I nuded up and jumped on the table. In walked Jasmine. Massage was okay, and before the flip I asked the question of extras and was told $50 for a HJ. I thought this was a bit steep and declined. Massage continued and she eventually started the sack and crack tickle... I tried negotiating on the flip but she wouldn't budge and said that's the standard price here. I succumbed to the pressure as I needed a release. I didn't ask for other extras, as I wasn't interested but there may be more on offer... I guess as always YMMV always applies. 

Would I return? Yes but I'll try one of the other young ladies...

Entered the shop and saw Nikki on the receptionist desk and said hi.
(Nice cleavage ! I wish she could massage me, one day).  
Met Mimi - slim Korean decent looking young girl (looks early 20's).
She ushered me to the front room  (the one with shower).

Friendly and chatty - during the massage I asked her for nude HJ which she said yes - 
So she stripped to her undies and asked my help to take off her top and panties (which I gladly obliged!).

Nice A cup tits - and pussy with slightly grown hair. 
She allowed my hands to roam everywhere in her body. 
I was after quick release - which she did it nicely. 
Showered afterward and I left quite happy.

Rates : $50/30 min + $80

Age : 20s

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Viet

Services Provided : Massage + nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes.

My experience/comments : 

I'd not been here for a long time for a number of reasons, but dropped in today. Saw Jenny (now going under the name of Elly) and she remembered me. $50 for a 30 minute massage. Come the flip, I suggested that she take off her clothes. Apparently the pricing here now is $50 for a HJ, and $100 for nude. As I was an old regular, she accepted $80. No kissing of tits (magnificent as they are) touching only, and touching of the arse but no pussy play.

Elly provided a very good hand job to completion. She's a nice girl.

WIR? Probably not, as the prices seem to have become too high compared to what I can get elsewhere. For $130 I got a nude massage with no touching from (an admittedly attractive) Asian lass; for $140 I can get a 30 minute nude massage with full access from a hot Caucasian (based on locanto ads anyway), or FS for $130 with Amy...

Never thought my prediction of 150$ nude hj, would happen so quickly, ok its 10$ short.  I don't regret starting all those price threads at all, even after receiving so much heat.

I cannot believe how these idiots are paying $140 or $150 for a nude handjob. That is double the going rate, $70 nude massage and tug, in places all around melbourne. There are even many places in the cbd where you can get a $70 nude handjob. Are these people too lazy to do some research and find them?

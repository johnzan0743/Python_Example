My experience/comments : Drove past here this morning and decided to call in for a road test.

Walking in met by a gent whose was certainly looking me up and down.  Paid for a 45min massage (all the time I had) and shown to a room with a mattress on the floor (my choice).  I strip down to the jocks as this is my first time here and I want to see what is on offer, and then get down to the mattress.

Nana comes in shortly after with some hot towels to wipe me down.  This feel nice and is certainly a welcome start.

Her English is very good considering she has only been in Australia for a year and is due to go back shortly.  We talk about Bangkok and other Asian cities that we have been to while she gives me a great relaxing massage.  Before the flip, she goes and get more hot towels and wipes me down.

On the flip, Nana is sure to cover me up and works away at my head and neck.  Before I get the chance to enquire as to special services, she announces that the massage is finished and leaves.  Looking around the room, no tissues or other give away signs, and therefore I am left with the impression that this is legit only.

AT.

P.S.: Coming up to my 100th post, and want to make it a good one.  Anyone have some ideas????

Thanks AT. I haven't been here for many a year and it was legit when I last went. I haven't heard of anyone having any luck.

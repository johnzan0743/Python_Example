Walked past here last week about 5.30 and there were 3 hot young asian girls standing at reception. As I'd been here before with some impressive results, thought a massage was in order.
 Was shown to a room out near the kitchen and was thinking how cute all 3 girls were, nude up, hop on table and in walks Grandma. Since it was too late to bail, opted for the medium massage. Quite impressive massage it was too until the flip and after a minute she just starts the tug despite the little fella having the hardness of slime (who remembers that). Now I'm not a bad looking bloke, not old and like getting a bit of rnt because it's just better when a little Asian fox does it for you but I just cant find it in me to be tossed by a woman older than Eartha Kitt. So I politely declined and tolerated the feeble attempt finish to the massage. I think she was offended. Anyway, will still go back again but will do a better stake out before entering.

Value for money/recommend? : Maybe

My experience/comments : I was in Melbourne for the boxing day test. Had a day off. Saw this place which looked dodgy enough (open to 10pm according to the sign) Went there about 11am. Only one older lady. Ask for 1 hour FB massage. Asked to take "clothes off". Asked "have you been here before" I replied no, but plenty of places in Sydney. Initially pretty average massage but ripped towel off and started to massage groin. Asked me to turn over early and said 50 dollars for top off and HJ. I thought pretty steep for Sydney standards but suspect reasonable for Melbourne. I have her 50 and she gave a reasonable HJ while she pulled her top up and gave me her breasts to handle. I climaxed and had long post quite soothing massage with much groin work. Said she was finished by about 45 minutes. I left seeing that a younger lady had also started work. I might come back one day and try the other lady...

Hours of Business : 10am to 10pm

Rates : $50 1 hour massage + $50 for the tug

Age : 28ish

Size/shape : Average - carrying very few extra kgs

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage and HJ (top up)

Value for money/recommend? : No! I object to paying $50 for a handjob when I can pay about $20 in Sydney.

My experience/comments : When visiting from Sydney dropped into this shop when I couldn't find anything better. Massage was probably about 3/10. Tina was okay looking and amusing: apparently a student studying English and working a few days a week, who drives a Merc. Accused me of being stingy when I tried to bargain on the HJ cost. Allowed a little fondling through her clothing, but moved often to avoid much more. I only got her down to $40 for the HJ, but ultimately paid her $50. Very poor value compared to what is on offer in Sydney, but maybe not so bad for Melburne. I will try elsewhere when next in town. I enjoyed my visit to Tiffany's several years ago much more.

My experience/comments :  Attractive young girl on at reception started the massage, I quickly realised she had no idea and asked for someone else. Helen, although considerably older, gave a much better massage, and had a bubbly demeanour.  On the flip we negotiated a little extra, which was competently delivered.  I was amused that this happened in the curtained off area at the very front of the shop, with other customers just metres away.

On an ancillory note, sometimes the older more experienced girls can be better. Good punthing Gents.

Nationality or Ethnicity: PRC

Services: Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend ? Value YES, recommend if you're in need of some relief

My experience: Was walking through the Paramount Centre and saw this place with some ladies sitting around the foyer part of the shop.  Went in and enquired about price etc and was told $30/30 mins or $50/hour.  Took the hour option so got a small discount on the dollar per minute rate.
Not too much privacy as you're in a curtained area right nest door to the shop entry.
Massage skills were quite good, getting into the tight spots and working out the knots and so.  When on the upper legs, increasing amount of work on the inner thighs with a few touches on the privates as she moved up.
On the flip, started on shoulders and upper chest leaning over, but not too far, just enough to tease.  Went down to the legs and worked on the calves and then the thighs working right up to the groin area and making it quite obvious extras were available.  By this time, it was getting obvious that the offer would be taken up.
HJ technique not as massage technique but I got over the line with a well oiled body part.
Would I return?  If in the area and looking for a cheap massage and extras yes, but would possibly try others first

Sabaydee... ohmygooosh.
 It seems that Paramount Centre has the highest concentration of massage parlours per square metre of all times: I can count at least five, 60% of which deliver what we're looking for.
 That's not bad. But are their services worth the money? Only one way to find out.


 The latest addition, Sabaydee massage, grabs my attention during a casual lunch brake in the food court. I finish my noodles, I look at the watch, and I think “why not?”.
 I always wanted to give Lomi-lomi massage another go – after an extraordinary experience a long time ago – and seeing they well advertise that service (with the bonus of health funds rebate!) I walk in with a smile on my face.


 The place looks professional, all new partitions (but not reaching the ceiling, unfortunately) and a cosy vibe. So I lay down and I wait for my destiny.
 My lady's name is Sa-Sa, one of those women who look in their mid twenties although she's probably close to forty. Good on her.
 She's also wearing a cute short dress and she doesn't mind jumping on the table and sitting on my bum. She apologises for her poor English, I say it's not a problem and ask for the aforementioned Lomi-lomi massage. She panics, she doesn't know what I'm talking about and starts working on my back.  


 Hmmm... so far three things are pissing me off:
 1) My English is not academic, but at least I understand what people say.
 2) You can't advertise for a service you don't provide!!
 3) Something is scratching my back, she has something on her right hand, I don't know if it's a nail, a scab or a WART...


 The massage itself it's not the worst I've ever had but it's lame.  
 I'm bored... and she's bored too: she keeps sort of singing over the music tune in the background.
 The massage is not getting any sensual at any point, then she starts poking my cheeks through the towel and I think “what the hell, 70 bucks and you don't even touch me there?”. So I pull my towel away and I ask to do it properly with some oil. She gives me a grin and goes to work. Again, without giving any hint of something more interesting coming. I sigh.


 Face up time. She does my head, legs, arms and I'm just there thinking about all the places I could have visited to receive a much better massage for the same amount of money, if not less.  
 So I'm lost in my thoughts and images of flying coloured notes when she pokes my shoulder and gives me the international gesture for a nice finish. I'm sort of surprised, I look at her with my eyes wide open and she shows me three fingers. I raise two. She insists on three. I stand still on my two and I add “and can you also use your LEFT hand only, please? Don't worry, it's a fetish of mine...”.


 The service is mechanic and with no passion, I'm glad I saved ten bucks.
 On my way out, I notice boxes and boxes of table napkins from the supermarket, they use those instead of the proper thing to cover the face hole and the pillow. Odd.
 I leave the premise less happy than when I entered.

My experience/comments : Have been going here for many times and dissapointed that Coco doesn't work there as much. New mature lady Salena has sort have become Coco's replacement. Standard process, disrobe and lay on the table. Oilled massage starts at the shoulders and works its way down the back and buttocks. After some thigh attention and few fly-buys the inevitable question comes. Best that it comes before the turn so you can enjoy the extra attention face down (I like that). The flip and straight into it. Salena does enjoy the inside clothing touching and doesn't charge more than the standard HJ for it.

My experience/comments : Popped in here late Sunday after a busy weekend to massage & relax.  Selina seemed like the only one on duty and she led me into one of the curtained rooms near reception.  I took an hour and her massage was very relaxing.  She was quite inquisitive in her talk, I could see where she wanted to lead to and soon she started massaging seductively around my thighs and buttocks.  Eventually it was time to turn over, she soon continued her tease until finally she asked if I wanted to remove the towel.  By this time I was in no position to say no, I negotiated from $50 to $30 - the towel fell to the floor and cupped with a handful of oil she proceeds to tug. Starting slowly then building up speed until I reached the moment of pleasure.  She is quite nice for her age, not sure but she could be older than 40's but she certainly know what she is doing and left me completely satisfied.  She wiped me down, I then asked to have a shower which she said OK and as I was leaving she smiled and asked that I return again soon.

The only room with a door is at the front off to the right. You can request it. Very obliging, but they want more $$ then Elgin street. Elgin street seem happy with $20 for a RnT. Lt Bourke street push for $40 but reduced to $30 for a RnT. However it was a good one. 
Management is very friendly and so are the girls. English is usually very poor. But cant complain about the service.

Selina has been reviewed several times already, but thought I should add mine based on a few visits over the past few weeks.

The first time I stayed, I was offered an hour for $50. Subsequently, they say $70, and I reply that it was $50 last time, and it is quickly agreed to.

Anyway, Selina has an excellent massage technique. She can really get the knots out. When asked at the start if I want soft or firm, I have always asked for medium. In her medium massage, she applies pretty firm pressure, and I don't think I would like to try her firm massage service. But for those who enjoy a good hard massage, Selina might be the one for you.

I haven't bargained the hj price with Selina, on my first visit she put up 5 fingers, and I thought $100 plus hj is good value. Subsequent visits I have still handed over $100. After a few visits, I am confident that nothing more is on offer from Selina, but YMMV.

Date of Visit : Aug 2013

Rates : $1/min

Age : 20

Size/shape : short, full bodied

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Massage & HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

After reading about this place on the forums and seeing as they have good value for money, I thought I'd pay them a visit. I have experienced FS at legit places, but this was my first time at one of these establishments.

It was a Wednesday afternoon close to knock off time. I turned up and saw 2 ladies there, it didn't appear to be busy. I noticed the curtained off booths and thought this may get a little awkward. I asked for 45 min for $40 (must be having a special on as this seems cheaper than others have reported here).  After a bit of chit chat between the two ladies (all in Chinese,) I was taken to a more private room  they must have sensed what I may have been after.
I stripped down to my jocks and lay on the table, and as the WL1 (Karina) came in, asked (or rather, signed) if  they could come off.  After a short delay because of the language thing, she was fairly quick in helping me whisk them off  so things were off to a good start.

About 20 min in and still on my front, the other WL (WL2) stood in the doorway and further chit chat occurred. Everything appeared OK so I thought nothing of it. Next thing I know  WL2 is standing near my head in the corner (it is a rather small cubicle). My thoughts were that this girl is new and wants to observe  and I started getting an arousing, voyeuristic feel about it all.

WL2 left again, then came the flip with strategically placed towel, and my chest and tummy got a rub. When my right leg was getting its rubdown, WL2 reappeared, and this time started to work on my left. I could hear them both whispering to one another. I became interested as to why I was getting two for the price of one, but kept my eyes closed as I savoured the moment.  A minute or two later, I could feel WL2 getting ever closer, and nonchalantly moving the towel higher as she rubbed my inner thigh. A few rubs later and felt both sides the towel move higher to my tummy, and only just covering my manhood. As we approached the final 10 minutes, the question was popped by WL2, I nodded, and the towel was briskly removed. By this stage WL1 had retreated to the corner of the cubicle behind my head. WL2 then told me that WL1 was new, and asked me if it was OK if she watched. Well, you can imagine the arousal that created in me. From what I thought would be a nice introduction to the rnt scene has become quite a voyeuristic experience with CFNM as well (an aspect of this which I have not seen mentioned often in these forums). 

I had briefly thought of asking WL1 to help, but didn't want to discourage her. She's short and a little plump, not overly attractive, but with a very cute face. WL2 was pleasing to look at. The tug itself did not take long which is OK because it was a little mechanical. I could not get the idea out of my head of the newbie WL1 (who gave me quite a good massage) was standing less than a metre away and had a full uninterrupted view of me exploding all over my stomach. 

I have read elsewhere on the forums there are those who prefer no towel and others who enjoy the suspense of not knowing that comes with having one on. I have to admit that certainly this experience has made me a big fan of the latter option. The interplay between who is the initiator (WL or customer) is an interesting one. It seemed like WL2 was teaching WL1 how to initiate as well.

Went down again at 5pm on a Tuesday afternoon and hoping for the possibility of having another ‘training session’ that I was lucky enough to experience last week. Walked in and saw one ML – Mary, and asked for half an hour. Mary is a not-unattractive MILF sort of girl. She directed me to one of the more private cubicles and asked me to take my clothes off. I left my jocks on, and asked if I could remove them (I think it’s only polite) once she returned – yes of course she replied.

She placed some oil on my back and started rubbing it in. I was wondering when the massage would actually start, as all I felt was a gentle hand rubbing on my back. Then I felt a hint of pressure on my shoulder…but no, back to the gentle rubbing with an open palm. He hands moved from my back to my bottom, and regularly slid down between my legs and past my ball sack. This is the first time for me that the ML has initiated so early on in the piece. The ‘massage’ remained pathetic, but her strokes coming ever so close from behind were too much to bare, and I was about to ask if I could turn over, but she beat me to it. We were only 10 minutes into it, and what appeared to be a dismal start, suddenly took a turn for the better. 

I lay there on my back, sans towel, and she started lightly rubbing my tummy.  She then pointed to percy and asked if I want. She put up 5 fingers to which I replied with 2 and said twenty. She then out up 3 and I stuck to my guns. She reluctantly agreed and commenced. It became clear early on that Mary’s forte was not in massaging, but the ancient art of lingam. She used the right amount of oils, changes hands, and often used both hands. I laid back and enjoyed, but occasionally had to sneak a peek just to see what she was actually doing – I had never felt this before and could often not work out what she was doing. She took it at just the right pace, slow rhythmic movements that felt great but did not arouse too much.

After over 10 minutes she could sense I was getting quite excited, but she continued at the same pace – just not enough to really get me going. Not frustrating at all, and if anything heightened was about to come. I asked if I could touch her leg and she agree, and also suggested I move closer to her. She picked gradually picked up the pace and kept going afterwards with a gradual wind down – she is obviously quite experienced. More evidence of this is that she knew what to do with an uncut cock, unlike most others that wonder how on earth they need to handle it.

Overall – and if cock massage is what you are after – then this was a fantastic experience and I would gladly return to see Mary again. Only problem is that I don’t think she works there regularly. In a way I felt guilty for only giving her $20 – the cock massage was much better than any other tug I have received for $30. But then again, any massage was no- existent, so overall I thought it was fair. I also sense that a cock massage is easier on the girl than doing a proper full body massage with pressure.

As I left, I saw 2 other MLs, both of which could not hold a candle to Mary in the looks department. Although quite different from my first visit to this place, my second visit has also been a success. I wonder if my luck has run out, or if I should take another punt… I think you all know the answer.

A couple of questions Native,

- was the fee $60 + $Extra (20) for 60 mins massage and or cock worship

- was Mary naked ?

Maybe your next review will say when Mary works.

My last visit here I was assigned a butt-ugly mutt of a ML lady who I know from experience gives an average massage and hj.  I had to start walking out the door before they took my request for a different girl seriously and magically found another lady from behind one of the curtains.  Can be good value though if you get a decent girl as the prices are quite cheap.  The last time I lucked into a double was at M&J in Carlton where the departed MILF-y mamasan was training Yoko and demonstrated all her various massage tricks, including a unique pressure-massage around my asshole.  Will have to try Paramount at the other end of the centre sometime.

Visited here yesterday (Friday).  Forget the lady's name (PRC, long dark hair, aged face) but she was probably late 40's and skinner/taller than most of the other girls I've seen in this shop.  Gave her two $20's (for 30 min) and she quickly returned with $10 change.  Rather than accepting the change I pulled another $10 out of my wallet and passed it to her.  "Thank you." she said and walked back out for a minute before returning.  A standard massage then she went right into the tug on the flip, using both hands, lots of oil and stroking my balls and my ass as she did the deed.  She let me grab her ass through her pants but shook her head when I tried to shove my hand down the back.  After I came she returned to the massage and did her best to fix the sore muscles on my back and around my shoulders.  Will try the Bridge Rd Ping's next time as I want to locate an older massage lady who is happy with boob grabbing and knows how to get me excited pre-flip.  Pings is cheap and pretty downmarket - while I was behind the curtain another guy rocked up outside and said "Can I just get 15 minutes?", obviously keen to save his $15 on the average back rub and simply pay the usual rate for the quick included wank.  Not bad but I miss the days when there was more available in the CBD and despite Ping's bargain-basement prices Melbourne overall seriously needs to have a good look at Sydney sometime to learn what are acceptable rates and provision of services in the 21st Century.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, for something cheap

My experience/comments : Walked in at 8pm or so, nice & quiet, girl on reception wasn't great but thought lets give this place a go, went for the hour given its quiet cheap.  She led me to the front room on the side, even though it had a curtain at the entry, seemed reasonably quiet.  Was told to undress, being my first time there left the jocks on & laid down.  Could hear someone showering so was hoping for a glamour to appear.  Unfortunately helen came back, straight away she asked if she could take my jocks off, great this sounds good.  She gave a great all over massage and began to concentrate on my legs & butt, stroking down the crack balls & eventually feeling my little fella.  This went for quite a while which I enjoyed.  She was reasonably quiet but had a nice friendly & sensual way about her.  Finally the flip after 30min or so and she began to rub my upper legs & tease the little fella & balls, pleading for a hj & possibly cbj, negotiated $30 for the hj.  I managed to hold on for a while and she was ok to slow down & help me enjoy it, finally erupted.

She then continued with more massage of my legs which was great then washed me down.

All up great for a good massage & hj.  Would be keen to see how the other ladies are.

Popped in for a quick visit at about 2pm on a Friday. I was greeted by the receptionist, asked or 30 min, paid, and was ushered to a cubicle and told to undress. A minute or two Mary popped in – I recalled her from my last visit here nearly 2 months ago. I recall Mary’s excellent tug technique, and slipped her $20 before we started.

I had forgotten how awful her massage technique is. With lots of oil, one hand, she gently rubs on my lower back, bottom, and then down between my legs. Thanks fully she asks me to turn over fairly quickly and makes a start on the final act. She has very good two handed action with plenty of oil. The cadence is relatively slow, nice, and not fast enough to get you over the line. Occasional eye contact to monitor things. It takes me about 10 min, and she notices I’m heating up. The tempo increases gradually, until she senses I’m in the final sprint, and she responds accordingly. Also nice wind down afterwards. A clean up and then an elaborate cleansing ritual with the towel.

All up we spend about 25 min on a non-existent massage but wonderful ending. Mary now works here four days per week from Tues to Fri.

I was staying in town and looking for a good massage with some pressure relief. Ended up at the Paramount Centre at Full Body...it looks Ok.. Paid for half hour and went to the room which was tiny. Stripped and went to lie down and the hint of the smell of semen..I put paper down on my private area and it seem the towels are not changed. In came my masseuse ..I had seen her before in Footscray Full Body and at Carlton Natural Therapies...great she is a tank and not appealing...Opted for just a massage and when it came time for the question I graciously said no thank you...A wash down and I was out of there.

My experience/comments :
Was pretty happy with Sabaydee across the hall from this place, but always looking for more I decided to give this place a go. The girl on the front desk looking cute didn't hurt either - although when I got up close she wasn't as cute as from outside. Anyway, she asked what I wanted. 30 mins, $30. She was pretty grumpy looking and lead me to a room and walked off. Perhaps I looked like I knew what I was doing... Anyway onto the bench and in walks Sunny about 5 minutes later. She was friendly, pleasant enough to look at and could understand me. Three big bloody plusses. The massage started and was reasonable. Nothing to write home about (lets be honest who would I write about this to anyway except you lot). Turned over at about the 20 minute mark and then up comes the topic of extras. She asks me how much I'll pay. Is this something new? I've noticed a trend with girls asking how much you'll pay before telling you their asking price. I say $30 and she says no way, $50. First time I've EVER paid that much for something else, but I thought I'd try and get something extra for the extra $20. Oral was off the table, so was topless. She let me fool around under her top and that was about it. And then she bloody complained about my cold hands. Sorry love, but for an extra $20 over market rate you can put up with it. Tug was decent, cleanup good. Probably a 7/10 quality adjusted to a 5/10 considering the price. Won't make that mistake again.

My experience/comments : 

According to the Locanto ad, this is a new place and certainly seemed that way with fairly nice surrounds and facilities  just didn't appreciate the BO coming off the towel when I turned my head to the left of the hole in the table, but made this find too late.

After having trawled thru the Locanto ads and struck out with 3 different privates with delays etc this seemed to be a reasonable backup plan even if I had to TOFTT  no reviews that I've seen yet.
Come upstairs to the reception area to be greeted by a young asian hottie in tight professinal outfit and thought I was in luck, established that 30 minutes was the target and led to room where the sad words "other lady come in soon" were uttered  no matter, always hope. So off come the clothes and assume the starfish.
Sally comes in pretty soon and looks rather chunky but not unattractive, so away we go with negotiations  was not going to waste time if nothing was on offer.
Straight into the offers but then no budging from the $30 handjob and $50 top off and feel so decide to proceed as there was nothing shy in the delivery. Money up front so quick rise and retrieve then back to starfish.
While the massage proceeds we have a chat about Korea and other asian nations etc, so getting along quite well. Massage, however, was minimal and negligible at best, lucky I went with powder not oil. Lots of mild brushing of the crack and inner thighs hardening things up time to time while I try to roam along hers (but get no further) until it's time for the flip. This indicated by her removing her top and bra revealing a rather fuller figure than I was expecting but no matter.
Technique is good regardless of anything else so she soon has me at attention (was pretty quiet down below on the flip). Lots of ball play, both hands in motion, rubbing of the shaft, an interesting rotation over the head, clamp on the base with one hand and then alternate between shaft rub and head twirl.
To give her credit, she gave a very good handy with lots of variety in motion and pressure without rushing it and milked every last drop out of the eruption.
Cleanup, get dressed and down the stairs.
WIR  maybe to see if the hottie on reception does massage, otherwise only the tug technique was worth it.

Yes this shop is the former Oasis. They changed the name because they got a new owner. Some of the girls from Oasis can still be found here (Sally and Rena). The ad is a bit misleading, they close on Sunday as I came on Sunday a couple weeks ago and its close.

Another massage shop taken over by another massage mob because no one has any ideas anymore for a business that will make any money other than  massage.

Rates: $50 for 30 mins and $70 for hr plus extras
Age:about 23
Size / shape:slender and nice Looking
Service provided:massage and tug 
Nationality : Korean 
Value : good massage
My experience:
Rocked up here about 9.15 pm , sign on door said closing at 8.30. An attractive slender girl Olivia said could do half hour
Quote $50.warm clean room and she got started with a firm very good massage , I really enjoyed it,on the flip she signaled
rwo fingers for $20 for tug .i indicated nude and response was not today.To  be fair she was dressed to go home and looked A1. Ok and proceeded . Did not get me over the line as we had 10 minutes left .She didn't rush me but it was obvious it was go home time,so I let it go for an unfinished evening.She went out for me to dress and when exiting I handed her the extras $ but to my surprise she insisted on no payment and pressed it back . I said I will return for a longer visit , as half hour is no good for me when 20 minutes is taken upon the back massage.She said next time she would do nude .Lovely looking girl and seemed a good quality style of person ( suspect she should not be  working in this industry).
Enjoyed and will return

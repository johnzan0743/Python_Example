My experience/comments :
Just having a bit of a stroll after work and discovered this joint. Advertised quite cheap prices so I figured why not, I'm feeling sore. I walk in and I am greeted by Jenny, a woman in her early 40's possibly, quite tall and decently shaped.The massage was quite good so I am sure she is an experienced veteran. I normally visit the younger ones but decided to try something different to see if it would excite me. You can tell Jenny would have been quite a looker back in the day and would have turned some heads. Once the flip was initiated, after 10 minutes or so, I immediately motioned to the extra $30 I had in my wallet. She said she would collect it afterwards and kissed my chest gently. Proceeded with an excelelnt tug and was quite active playing with my ass lol.
A good session for the price.

My experience/comments :

Came across this ad on locanto, did a bit of texting, thought maybe the old shop in suite 710 had re-opened, but this is a different suite. The ad had all the promising signs, and so I texted to make an appointment. There was a bit of to-ing and fro-ing, but I figured the picture on the ad seemed nice enough (it's her, BTW) so I persevered. When I got there I was Yuki was pretty much as her photo and I was shown into a small massage room -- promisingly the bin was full of tissues!

What next happened was an OK deep tissue massage (I asked for relaxation) with a fair amount of oil (I asked for none, but conceded on a little, ended up with what felt like half a chip shop's worth of oil on me) and strictly no happy ending or anything else. We had an OK chat about it; she was not offended but firm.

At the end of the massage (back only) she got out a nice hot towel to wipe off most of the oil, and then used tissues to clean up the rest. I was still quite oily by the end of it.

So guys, this one is a legit straight massage. I am $40 and 30 minutes wiser; all in all not too big a price for this lesson.

WIR: No. I've had better straight massages elsewhere.

You can wipe this place off your possible punts in my opinion .
Saw it advertised on the Internet with all sorts of come ons. Found the place on level 2 (  unmarked enterprise in suite 211) of an office building. I visited  at about 6 pm last week.
Yuki is Chinese .i booked an hour at $80 .she works on her own,is about 28 reasonable looks and moderate size.she seemed ultra nervous .room was neon lit and bright .She started on my back.i was starfish and naked.no towel offered.
Massage was pretty ordinary .kept telling me she  wanted  to go buy clothes and was obviously anxious to go.
After 45 minutes ,still doing my back,she says times up.No sign  of any extras,no turn over. WTF.
When I get up she has a face mask on. God strike.Definatly not what her adds imply.
She says she has been in business a month.i can't see her lasting too many more months
A bit of a disaster area .Avoid.

No that is the correct address
But I would suggest it is a total loss and waste of money ,  both for a reasonable massage or anything else

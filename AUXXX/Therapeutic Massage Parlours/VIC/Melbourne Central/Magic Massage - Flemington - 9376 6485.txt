 Magic Massage - Flemington - 9376 6485
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Fio

Establishment : Magic Massage

Date of Visit : 10 December 2015 

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Shop 13, 320 Espon Rd, Flemington.  Ph: 9376 6485 

Hours of Business : 10.30 - 9pm, 7 days 

Rates : Normal whole body $130, but special 1/2 price when I went. 

Age : Early 20's

Size/shape : Small, petite girl.  No extras, so guessing size 8 with b cups. 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Malaysian 

Services Provided : Massage only 

Value for money/recommend? : Not at normal price.  Special ok for massage only.

My experience/comments : As soon as I walked in I thought I was in trouble.  The girl behind the counter (Fio) was nice enough, but it was one of those setups like you see in Westfield where no individual rooms, just curtains between the massage booths.

Anyhow, I had some time to kill, so thought I would give it a go.  Massage was ok, but no sign of extras, and even after quietly asking, other girls walking around, no extras on offer here - well at least not to me.  Walked out $65 lighter, but back was feeling ok.

Post Content: 
Establishment : Urban Kneads

Date of Visit : 11/07/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 2/373 Little Bourke St, Melbourne +61 403 316 358

Hours of Business :10-8? Not sure. 

Rates : 30 mins / $50 massage. Extras $50

Name: Monica

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : claims Thai but looked and sounded Filipino from accent 

Services Provided : HJ, touching. 

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : Saw the ad on locanto and was expecting your normal rnt kinda setup but this was a pretty clean and nice place. Nice piano music to help relax and a nice interior decoration.

Had been directed into a room and make myself comfortable by the receptionist and that Monica would be in soon.

Asked about extras and she said $50 for HJ. But would give me a "special" with touching added. No nude. Didn't want to pay it, but sized her up and she had a lovely rack so wanted to get my hands on them. So paid it. I'm a sucker.

The massage was good. Got the knots worked on. The HJ was good too as well as the rack. Felt as good as they look. Wasn't allowed to touch below the waist unless it was over the pants so that sucked.

WIR: Maybe if just massage. Not worth it for extras.

Mods, the contact number for this place is 0403 316 358

Dropped in here on spec yesterday (as I had no phone number). No luck as they were all booked out, but the place looks nice, as did the receptionist! She took a call while I was there, and emphasized the sensual massage as well as "other options" that she wouldn't talk about over the phone.

Will return.

Person's Name : Charlie

Establishment : Urban Kneads

Date of Visit : 29/7/2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 2/373 Lt Bourke St

Hours of Business : 10-11 7 days

Rates : $50/30 mins + $70 extras

Age : 20s

Size/shape : short, not slim but not stocky, hairy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Half Aussie half Fijian

Services Provided : Exchange Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : No.

So this seems to be one place in the city that's actually open late. And it's central. And discreet. Which makes what happened all the more disappointing.

Was in town for a work function, so headed in to Urban Kneads afterwards. Had rung, inquired about the roster, and requested Petra the Aussie girl. Arrived a couple of minutes early, said I'd rung, ah yes says the fellow on reception, you rang about Petra. Handed over my pineapple, and he showed me into a room. It was serviceable, but a bit cold.

After about 10 minutes, this chick comes in, olive complexion, long hair, decent looking bod under the clothes. "Hi Petra," I say. "No, I'm not Petra, I'm Charlie," says the girl. Hang on, she says, I'll go and check. Comes back in a couple of minutes later, "No, there's no Petra who works here."

Thought it was a bit odd, but whatever. Did I want a soft or a sensual massage I'm asked. Sensual, I reply. Suddenly her voice drops to the level that not even CIA microphone could pick up. I hear the word, "extras", and over the next few minutes (cut an already long story short here) I found out that each extra is worth $50: HJ, topless, exchange. She then says, "I can give you two for $90, $80, $70." I figured had I kept waiting it would have been for free, but said yes to $70 for HJ and exchange.

She had to be first on exchange to ensure the oil didn't rub into her clothes. Yep, whatever. So I get massaging her, and for all of the reaction I may as well have been massaging one of those resuscitation dolls they use in first aid courses. I'd never come across a hairy back before either (maybe I just haven't got out much). Not a turn off as such. Ask her to roll over, she covers the pussy, and it appears a push up bra has been involved in inflating the figure, shall we say. She then tells me (in the CIA-avoiding-whisper) that I can have covered oral for an extra $100 or FS for $300. Um, no. 

She then tells me that she's cold, and wants to get dressed. That's fine, it was starting to get very cold in the room. I then received what was possibly the lamest HJ I've ever received. Ended up taking over from her, shutting my eyes, and thinking about an ex-girlfriend.

As I got dressed, the towel was flipped -- ugh.

All in all, a pretty crappy experience for $120. Despite its obvious attractions (discretion long hours), I won't be returning in a hurry unless I hear from others that mine was an unusual experience.

Apologies for the long post.

Asking that much for FS ($300) usually indicates that she doesn't really want to do it but willing to go along if someone is stupid enough to pay it.

The hairy back would have turned me off

Think as a pure massage joint, this place is alright. Extras are way too expensive and something that differs from girl to girl. The receptionist kinda doesn't want to discuss or know about it.

,

The problem was there was a whole bunch of markup (the <color="0x333333"> stuff) without the closing tag (</color>) in your review as posted. I have removed that so your review looks as you intended.

Perhaps you could try something like,

1 Copy the review to something like 'Notes' in iPhone,
2 Hack it until you are happy and then
3 Paste it into the 'New Thread' window.

Then again, I take my hat off to anyone who posts a review from a mobile phone ...

I've (stupidly) been here 3 times, and that's it for me. The reason I kept coming back is because it's rare to find RnT's from Caucasians, especially in CBD. 

Both Heidi and Luna give good massages, and I'd go just for that. Luna especially gives a good sensual rub, and HJ from both girls did the trick. Saya wasn't good at either.

Tried to get the HJ for cheaper, but none of them would go for it. So many other places in the CBD (unfortunately no Caucasians that I know of) for cheaper, so no need to come here anymore.

 Urban Kneads - Emma

Person's Name : Emma

Establishment : Urban Kneads

Date of Visit : 08/10/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Little Bourke Street Melbourne (near Hardware Lane)

Hours of Business : 10:30am till Late

Rates : $50 an half hour $80 Full

Age : Mid 20s

Size/shape : D cup natural pierced, Slim 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Norway

Services Provided : HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

This is a new establishment (say 3 months) and the owner has 3 other and they rotate the girls around so not sure of who will be in on a given day. All very clean and professional - rooms reasonable private (you can hear a bit of talked in the rooms next door but nothing else.

The girls here charge about $50 - $70 for extras which usually only means HJ - most are young and good looking so the owner is going for a higher $$$ product. I don't mind this as you get what you pay for - if you don't like the sound of those rates dont go you are wasting your time. One frustration is that they are mostly a bit young and therefore inexperienced which make their service a bit same same.

Emma was a great experience really fit bod good massage 6/10 (HJ & Topless $50) I got the feeling nude would be on the cards once she knows you. Good HJ technique (a bit grippy on the knob after climax - but most seem to do that 8/10) It was so unusual for that nationality i thought it was worth it.

 Honey @ Urban Kneads Melbourne

Date of Visit : 18/10/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 2/373 Little Bourke St

Hours of Business : 10AM - Late

Rates : $80 + Extras

Age : Early 20s

Size/shape : Size 6

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Can get better value elsewhere

My experience/comments :

I'm in between homes after a sudden breakup with a long term girlfriend and have ben staying in Sydney and Melbourne as of late as I make the permanent move down south.

I was spending some time with friends in Melbourne, checking out the areas and potentially a place to live. Anyway, my friend takes me to a Ramen place in Little Bourke St, this place is tiny and theres a line outside, the ramen was fantastic but I'll leave that review for Urbanspoon.

Anyway, as we're lining up outside, I notice a massage joint still opened late at night, I don't think much of it and just enjoy my night with friends.

The next day, I was walking around the city and ended up Little Bourke St, the ramen place has a line outside the door in the day too but not as much as the dumplings joint which I'll have to try next time. Anyway, I decided, what the hell I'll try out that Urban Kneads place I saw last night. So I walk in and as I'm climbing the stairs I bump into one of the workers at Macpac or whatever adventure store that share the same building/staircase with Urban Kneads, they think I'm a customer and begin helping me with the layout of the store, after politely listening to them I finally proceed into Urban Kneads.

Now this place is clean, it has a medieval feel and bright sunlight coming into the main area. Greeted by the masaman she ushers me into a room where I wait. I'm finally greeted by a young girl named Honey (80% sure that's her name as it was a very quick meet and greet), having tried different RnT joints around Melbourne, this was the first young hot one that I actually wanted to bang and at this stage, I wasn't quite sure whether this place provided RnT.

I'm a big fan of RnT as I love massages and find that the girls aren't as jaded as the girls working in brothels. Anyway, Honey gave me an amazing massage, a million thoughts run through my mind as she massages away, I felt her long hair as she worked her hands from the top of my heads down as far as she can reach near my legs. After forty minutes or so (time flies in massage joints), she ask me to turn around and begins to massage my biceps. I keep making eye contact with her to see what else is on offer and after 5 minutes or so of massaging she ask if I wanted more. I asked how much and she requested $50, now I've had unreasonable request before and thought the price was a little steep and I pretend that I only have a $30 on me and she plays hardball and tells me that she only gets half of the $80 that I paid and that it wouldn't be worth it for her to do it for less than $50 and continues to massage me. After a minute or so I give in, this girl is gorgeous, long black hair, tiny hourglass figure and a sexy face with distinct cheekbones - she's model material in my eyes.

After we agree on the price, she proceeds to give me a dirty and tells me "$50 but you can't touch me", she starts lightly touching my thighs and balls before putting oil on the tip of my penis and giving me a nice HJ. She doesn't make much eye contact and as I lay there with this beautiful chinese girl giving me a HJ, I realised I just paid $130 for a one hour RnT session where the girl was a bit standoffish, very little words were exchanged besides "hi my name is Honey" and the negotiation but for some reason I wasn't pissed off like normally would be paying such premium for a regular RnT, in Sydney I can visit Midas for $165 for an amazing service with a naked Korean who pampers starting from the shower. Anyway, shes jerking me off and I think to myself, if I can't touch then I'll get my values worth checking out her body and I look her up and down, amazing tits and ass, her tits aren't too big, I'd say a larger B cup or a smaller C cup and her amazing lips and long black hair. She soon realises that I wasn't going to be as easy as her other clients and begins to act frustrated with me as I'm not cumming but I dunno, this would normally piss me off when I pay such a high premium and am made out to be like a delinquent who purposely stalls cumming but come on, I just paid $50 for a tug with no touching and a shit attitude and yes, I was having a little trouble cumming because I needed to pee midway through the tug but boy was she hot and her shit feisty attitude towards me actually turned me on and the thought of banging her eventually made me cum.

But yes, I would love to have a piece of Honey but at those premiums, banging her seems like it would be really expensive. I normally would feel ripped off paying $130 for a clothed massage with no touching but boy do I want to fuck this girl. Why are massage joints around Melbourne so expensive? would I go again? I probably would because I've yet to find a RnT joint with hot girls around Melbourne, any suggestions?

Having seen her a few times she knows what I like. The massage is mainly sensual, with her standing within hands reach at all times, enjoying touching her sexy body. When its time to turn over she gets me to sit on the edge of the bed so we can massage each other - however it wasn't long before I'd undone her bra & sucking on her delicious nipples & playing with her puppies. Finally time to lie down & I have her butt in one hand, a nipple in my mouth & a boob in my other hand.Not a cheap punt yet certainly worth it

Date of Visit : Wed 22/1/14

Rates : $80 hr ++++

Age : 22?

Size/shape : 6-8, great tits, hippy

Nationality or Ethnicity : English

Services Provided : "Bodyslide"

Value for money/recommend? : Hmm no despite a good time

My experience/comments : OK it has been weeks since i've been able to visit anywhere, and it feels like much longer as i've been so busy! Anyway, I happened to be in Little Bourke walking past and realised that I had a whole hour to spare.. what to do hey?
Anyway, popped in, and got given to Lucy. I was so glad, she was young, cute, and white. It's been so long since i've had a non asian RnT that I jumped at her ridiculous rates for a nude bodyslide. I won't even say how much I paid, too embarrased, but I was in the mood bad.
The massage was actually ok, but on the relaxing side moreso than therapetic. I asked her to take her knickers off which she had left on, but no go. wtf?
Anyway, body slide came, was crap really. Just about 2 mins of tits on back. Then the flip

At this time I got to have a play finally, as up to then she had remained out of reach. Kitty kat was off limits and she seemed a little shy at touching elsewhere. Got a couple of tits rubbed on face, but mouth action was frowned on.
The tug was too gently, poor technique, rubbing the wrong parts. But she was young, white, young firm tits and she filled the bill, so I don't want to totally diss her.
She used far too much oil too, I felt like I was in an oil slick. Lucky they had showers, but the soap in it smelled like fucking flowers so I had to race home and have another shower anyway.

WIR? Certainly not at those rates.

Heard things about this place and thought I'd check it out. Got lost on my first visit and took me 15 to finally find the joint. Went up the elevator into a professional lobby. No one at the desk. Ring the bell and was greeted by an older lady. I got the 45 min massage to mix it up. She showed me to the room. Tissues near by which was a bonus. Vanessa is tall swedish girl who comes in and starts the massage. I always go birthday suit. The room had a funny smell though, like that scented shit hippies burn. Massage was pretty good, got one knot out of my back and had good technique. She had a flat rack but nice ass. She had white jeans and a blue top on. No teasing or anything. With 10mins to go, the flip happens and still nothing. I point down to johnson and she said $80 for HJ. I tried and get it down to $50 but she doesn't agree. I don't accept her offer and she cleans me up and off I went. Good massage but 80 bucks for a HJ. WTF. She was goodlooking but 80 bucks. No no. Not copping that.

If these girls had any business or sales skills, they should let you know their menu from the start, rather then upsell in the last 10mins. Coz as much as we are horny, we can still calculate that $80 for 10mins is too expensive and not value for money. 

Also unless they are doing the extras from the get go, they should drop the price for extras. The house fee isn't the cheapest either. 

I personally like to book for an hour, get 30-40mins of an actual massage and then 20-30mins of fun, but there needs to be a build up & flow.

I had booked a hour and she offered HJ $50, topless $80 and I said I wanted nude with HJ and she said $100. I offered $50 for HJ and topless and he declined.
Way too much as I would have rather seen Natasha at that price.Shame she didn't counter offer, so I enjoyed a good massage with nice conversation.

So good to finally find a RnT place in the city with a variety of European girls. I stumbled into this place after work after reading some of the posts here, I thought I'll try my luck. I paid the half hour fee of $50 to the guy at the front and he assigned me room VII. After I stripped off in walked a Norwegian girl called Emma, very pleasant 22yo with great English. She took the towel off straight away and asked if I wanted extras, 50 HJ and 80 for a nude HJ. I only had $50 on me so went for the HJ. Her massage was great, a lot of attention to the important parts and she was cool with some very light touching of the leg. The final HJ was okay, nothing to rave on about. Emma has a bf who is apparently cool with the whole situation so as you can imagine she's pretty easy going. Anyway, treat her well as she's a lovely girl who gives great service. I'll probably come back to this place one day to try the nude with Emma, just need to weigh up the costs, $80 is a bit much.

making up for lost time. other cheaper altetnatives weren't available either so I decided fuck it, I'll try someone unseen, even if its premium cost.

After settling financials & nuding up, Emma comes in. Reminds me of a taller hotter Norwegian version of Audrey from Sabaydee but more fun. (a few steps below model quality) I say that I've been there before & want sensual relaxation. Extras offered were Hj $50, topless $60 & full nude $70. Ended up going topless for a total of $110 for 30's minutes. Said she doesn't do bodyslides. While she is gorgeous she does have pierced nipples & belly button which might turn off some.

Legit massage skill was good, felt like she knew what she was doing, though only slight amount of teasing. Allowed enough touching of her long slender legs & firm pert ass to not complain too much, but I got the sense shes not overly fond of having her beasts touched, & spent more time on the table out of arms reach than I like. (admittedly not at all. Ha!)

I initiated the flip & things got better - a bit of light spanish & better access to her cans- & being able to See her face, which is Very Nice indeed. Unfortunately she was a bit too quick off the mark for my liking, but once she slowed down the job got done.

Wir? If I was willing to fork out the coin for a hot blonde glamour, Yes..

Person's Name : Luka

Date of Visit : 7 May 14

Rates : $80 1hr. RnT $50. Topless $30. Nude $50. 

Age : 24?

Size/shape : Short, size 10. Slightly overweight

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : Nude RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Nope.

My experience/comments : Was walking by, had some free time, so decided to give this place another shot. Walked in stripped down, and was assigned Luka. Was happy when she locked the door on coming in. Luka is kinda cute but slightly overweight. Anyway, short version, I think she learnt massage by watching a video. Craptastic massage, no clue. Far too much oil. No idea how to use a hot-towel.
 But onto the other bits - we agreed on a topless + RnT for $70. But she then decided to strip off everything and climb onto my back at the beginning of the massage. So I had a little play which she didn't stop me from doing at all. The usual stuff happened, but far too quickly, so there I was all done 20 minutes into a one hour massage. The girl certainly didn't know how to space things out. She then told me that this was her third day, so I guess she has a hell of a lot to learn. I asked when else was on offer for next time, and she was like "lots". So I was like "full service" and she was yeah. I asked how much and she said $150 so I was like "man that's a lot, what do I get for $150" and she replied "full naked, you can play, do whatever, but no sex". I'm like huh no sex, then why is it full service? And she replies that she'll give oral as well if I really want. So man was I confused, it sounded like she normally wanted $150 for what she gave me for $70. So $230 for a crap nude rub and tug session? No thanks. I thought I was getting ripped off as it was.

Went to go get a coffee - came back around 11.45. Hooray! Open! But only 1 lady - an African Brit named Latoya. 

Person's Name : Latoya

Establishment : Urban Kneads

Date of Visit : 16 May

Rates : 50 for 30 min; 70 for topless HJ (got her to be in just panties)

Age : 20s

Size/shape : Curvy with great tits

Nationality or Ethnicity : British African

Services Provided : HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Depends on cashflow

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

After the closure setback, went back for another look, hoping for a European stunner which I've read so much about. 

Surprise is that only one lady was available. The papasan said that he's waiting for the others to arrive. 

Caved in due to blue balls lately. Latoya wasn't the prettiest, but looked to have great set of C's.

She was very chatty and friendly and got along well with her as a friend. Negotiated the topless down from 80 to 70. Seeing as the heating was turned up, she took off her skirt, too!

Nice rub (not a real massage) with tits rubbing my back. Hand able to roam everywhere but her pussy. On the flip, fondled and sucked on her great boobs until a nice, non-rushed HJ got me cumming hard. Was great. 

All in all I really enjoyed myself. Just wish it was cheaper

Person's Name : Kara
Establishment : Urban Kneads
Date of Visit : July 2014
Contact Details/Address/Weblink :373 Little Bourke St Melbourne
Hours of Business : 7 days 11am - 11pm
Rates : $80 / hr $90 for nude HJ
Age : Early 20's
Size/shape : Size 8
Nationality or Ethnicity : Brit/Welsh
Services Provided : HJ
Value for money/recommend? : Good, but not as good as before

I've been notified that Kara's been back from overseas for a while and is massaging again. As I really enjoyed my last session with her at Tokyo Milk last year, I decided to book her and see her at this place.

Rocked up and paid, laid naked on the table, and in comes Kara, cute as ever. She's a slim English/Welsh girl with a nice body, blonde hair and a few piercings. MAssage started with slow sensual strokes, and Kara got right to the point and asked what extras I wanted. Agreed on $90 naked HJ, Kara stripes off and begins to tease me all over with her tongue, kissing and licking everywhere. Particular attention was given to my nipples and neck as I loved those areas played with. My hands wandered all over her body, squeezing her B cup tits and played with her clit; Kara gently moved my hands away from her pussy and said that it's off limits. Well, that kinda sucks because the last time I saw her I finger fucked her pretty good and she loved it. Anyhow, the rest of the session consisted of her playing with my cock while pressing her naked body right up against mine. She also likes to bury my face into her neck...it's quite intimate but I prefer to look at her face rather then struggle to breath. As I take a while to cum there were times when I felt she was a bit distant and mechanical, but in the end I blew my load and had a shower to clean off.

All it all it wasn't a bad punt, but Kara seems a bit jaded since I last saw her. Either that or she was high on something...which wouldn't be surprising at all...

Funny enough, I saw her a few weeks ago as receptionist at Tokyo Milk. She's no longer massaging and she's planning to return to the UK.

Pop in here as ive never seen it. Managers name was Jim, gave me his personal mobile instead of a card.  Sounded professional and was a big burly cool looking European aussie.  He wouldn't put up with my fussiness.  Told me he had 10 therapists.  Heard nothing coming from the rooms and quite frankly wondered if this shop is really that busy.  Not a women in sight, but then again this is another non meet and greet rnt.

Person's Name : Emma
Establishment : Urban Kneads
Date of Visit : October 2014
Contact Details/Address/Weblink :373 Little Bourke St Melbourne
Hours of Business : 7 days 11am - 11pm
Rates : $80 / hr $80 for HJ
Age : Early 20's
Size/shape : Size 10
Nationality or Ethnicity : Norwegian
Services Provided : HJ
Value for money/recommend? : Okay

Had read a couple of reviews on Emma, so thought I'd venture to this venue for the first time and try the goods. One obvious disadvantages is going with a masseuse unseen, as beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, and Emma wasn't a beauty in my opinion. She is probably a 5/10, however a nice slim body, broad (as scandinavian people usually are) and very tall. I'm relatively short at 5'6'' and she easily towered over me.. i'm guessing she is 6' or more.

Paid $65 for 45 mins and got into the room. after 5 mins, Emma came to the room. Asked me what kind of massage I wanted and having read the reviews here, I was wise enough to ask upfront what her extras are. $50 for HJ, $70 or 80 for nude HJ, was her answer. I like cumming twice in these sessions, so negotiated $80 for 2 HJs fully clothed.

Massage started and was okayish, with some good pressure - Emma is a very strong girl and her physique obviously helps. Got an HJ upfront, which was nice. Nice caressing of the balls and the HJ got fast very soon. Her grip was a bit uncomfortable though however given I was quite sensitive I came quickly. Here's where it went a bit downhill - instead of cleaning me up, Emma threw a few tissues on my tummy and suggested I clean myself up. Then threw a few more when she saw I needed more, however at no point did she move towards helping me. Lying down, I couldn't be sure whether I had cleaned myself up entirely 

Then on to my tummy for a bit of massage. 10 mins and she made me turn around again and started. Once again, got me hard quickly however the HJ felt painful because she tends to hold the penis very tight and only stroke the mid-section, no length-long movements and certainly none on the head. Asked her to lighted it a bit and go the whole length, however, only got marginally better. Came again soon and once again, no effort to help me clean up.

Looked at the clock and it was only 25 mins into the session. She said we still have some time, however, I wasn't quite in the mood any more to lie there. Felt a bit cheated too because i had asked her to turn me over only in the last 5 mins. She asked for her money before I went to the shower, however had no change and I had nothing but a pineapple and 2 lobsters so had to part with $90 instead of $80. Again, didn't feel value for money to part with that much for this type of experience.

Overall - WIR - i wouldn't go back for Emma, I did go back for another girl (next review coming soon)

Person's Name : Katya
Establishment : Urban Kneads
Date of Visit : October 2014
Contact Details/Address/Weblink :373 Little Bourke St Melbourne
Hours of Business : 7 days 11am - 11pm
Rates : $80 / hr $70 for nude HJ
Age : 28
Size/shape : Size 6-8
Nationality or Ethnicity : Russian
Services Provided : Nude HJ
Value for money/recommend? : Good

Had read a few reviews of Katya as well and posters had rated her as very beautiful so decided to book in 30 mins with her. Got to the venue and paid the male receptionist who had an asian late 30s/ early 40s ML standing next to him talking. The ambience of the place has the feel of a Greek-styled sports massage venue, with statues all over the place. Take it up several notches and it might start resembling a German FKK.

Once again, having gone in sight unseen, I was a little bit disappointed when Katya came in. She is definitely good looking (7/10 on my books), however not the gorgeous model-like woman she was described as. Once again, discussed extras upfront - $50 clothed HJ, $100 nude HJ (lot more than mentioned in the reviews). I asked for clothed HJ only, however she seemed to want to offer and earn more, so we settled on double HJ nude for 80.

Upfront HJ which was very pleasurable, and of course i could explore Katya's nude body - feel her AA-B cups (just about perfect size for mine) and her shapely hips and soft round butt. Exploded within a couple of mins. She cleaned me up well (unlike Emma), which i was thankful for. 

Then on my front for a bit of massage. The experience with Emma had taught me that I can easily cum twice inside 30 mins so was on my back soon again and had Katya going at me once more. Had a good conversation with her while all this was happening - about her country, family, studies, etc. Nice friendly conversation. Round two started with my limp dick in her soft hands and soon became hard. She is happy to be explored although i didn't venture near the cat. Also allowed me to suck her beautiful little titties (please do it gently, she said), so with her left titty in my mouth, my left hand on her ass and my right caressing her right titty, I came once again.

Good clean up followed by hot towels and I was out after paying her for her services. A happy chappy I was. WIR = yeah sure. Would like to try out the other caucasian hotties there - any recommendations?

Date of Visit : Feb 2015

Rates :$80 - 60mins

Age : 25

Size/shape : Tall

Nationality or Ethnicity : Estonian

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : 2/10

My experience/comments :
This was the fourth visit back to the RnT place in Lt Bourke St. Previous three visits to this RnT place were pretty good. $80 to the guy at the front for the 1 hour massage. Undressed, on table with boxers on. Ami came in. Attractive girl with waist length blonde hair. Got the formalities are extras out of the way and took the boxers off. $100 for nude massage with touching ok but not (hand gesture) there. Asked about body slides and she said she couldn't due to a skin condition. Fair enough. Massage was so pathetic I thought she was asleep. She was also really thirsty and keep drinking heaps of water. Maybe she'd had a big night the night before. Finally started and she really gave the calf muscles an endless massage. I turned over after a while because it was a waste to time. It was so dull that I did't even have an erection. She played with me for a while, then I had to stop her so that I didn't come because there was so much time left. Then I got this great shin massage (i.e. waste of time). Soft on. Had to ask her to touch me again, and had to stop her again, then ask again. I might as well have done it myself. This experience was to bad that I don't want to go back to that place.

Date of Visit : early Feb 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 99397990, just up from Elizabeth St, above Mountain Designs

Hours of Business : 11am to late

Rates : $80 for an hour to the guy at the front, then extra $100 for body slides and HJ

Age : 25

Size/shape : Tall, strong, blonde, viking, amazing huge natural breasts and great body

Nationality or Ethnicity : Norwegian

Services Provided : Good massage, nude bodysides both front and back, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : 

Started with a good strong massage and body slide while lying on front. Her belly button jewellery would dangle along your back. Nice. Turned over at about half way. Touching ok but not at the Y. When standing at head massaging chest you could look upwards and get a great view of everything because she was so tall it was at about eye level. Beautiful body. The front body slide was excellent and holding those magnificent breasts was great. The HJ was slow and teasing and a good finish. Recommend Emma, but the guy at the front is a pain and my last experience there was terrible.

Person's Name : Chelsea

Establishment : Urban Kneads

Date of Visit : February 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 373 Little Bourke St, Melbourne

Hours of Business : unsure

Rates : $80/hr + $50 extra

Age : late 20s(?)

Size/shape : 8, C cup(?)

Nationality or Ethnicity : Filipina

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : I found myself hiking through Lil Bourke St when Melbourne decided the pleasant sunshine had gone on long enough and replaced it with an increasingly heavy shower.  As fate would have it, I spied the Urban Kneads shingle about 20m ahead so ducked into the stairwell to preserve the few remaining dry patches on my T-shirt.  I took the opportunity to consult the oracle (AXR) and was pleased to learn it was my kind of massage provider, so I climbed the stairs to the shop and stood in front of an attractive African receptionist.  She ran me through the prices and I thought an hour would be a welcome luxury given all the walking I'd done that day.  I was shown into an empty room just a few feet from her desk and she told me with a sly smile to make myself comfortable while awaiting my 'therapist'.  I was actually hoping she would be running her ebony hands over me, but alas, not today.

Just as I was removing my shorts, Chelsea entered the room and introduced herself.  I had been hoping for a Scandinavian or Baltic beauty (dreaming of Chilli) but was disappointed that I'd drawn a Filipina with blond-dyed hair.  With a headache.  I suggested I wouldn't mind if she sat this one out if she wasn't feeling up to it, but Chelsea said it would be OK and she has to work.  She seemed friendly enough and didn't bat an eyelid when I was completely bare and got comfy on the table.

The massage was pretty rudimentary to begin with, from the shoulders, back to legs.  After a while, she began sliding her hands in a circular motion over my arse cheeks and I murmured appreciatively.  As expected, she picked up on that and lingered in the happy zone, with greater attention on the inner thighs and the occasional brush in between.  Then she came up to the head of the table, crouched down so that we were face-to-face and whispered she could provide some extra services if I was interested.  Rates were rattled off and I was asked to think it over.  

I actually wasn't super horny, was more interested in a soothing massage, so only expressed interest in her, um, helping to blow my nose while she maintained her modesty in her top and jeans.  The original rate for this basic extra that was quoted to me was $50, which I had expected after having perused previous reviews.  However, when Chelsea came back up to enquire if I'd decided on an extra and I indicated my preference, the price had soared to $70.  I was pretty sure we were not operating in a super inflationary economic environment so I pointed out the discrepancy and politely declined.

Chelsea seemed a bit taken aback and went back to massaging my leg.  We had chatted on and off but now she was running on silent.  She still had a nice touch in my happy zone, perhaps in an effort to drain the blood from my big head and impair my decision-making faculties.  However, I was pretty relaxed and was quite prepared to leave without having my nose blown.  She cracked eventually and agreed to honour her original $50 offer.  

Now that terms were agreed, she began focusing her attention on my, ahem, nose which gradually gave a passable impression of Pinocchio.  Chelsea massaged my long hard nose for several minutes, while I encouraged her by squeezing her butt and bosom, until I finally cleared my sinuses of all the nasty mucus.  She cleaned up the sticky snot with many tissues and was quite chatty again while I dressed.  I dropped a pineapple on the table with my thanks and left her to pine for the lobster that she'd greedily overreached for as well and nearly missed out on anything extra.  The ebony beauty on the front desk flashed me a knowing smile on my way out.

Chelsea's mercenary approach was a bit off-putting and she wasn't really my type, so standing fast against the blatant gouging attempt wasn't hard.  Her nose-blowing technique was pretty ordinary as well, so $130/hr for the total experience was not great VFM for me but it loosened up my tired legs and gave me a chance to escape the rain for a while.  If I were in the neighbourhood again, I'd only return if I had a choice of masseuse.  Like Emma the tall Norwegian.

Date of Visit : 02 Oct 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : No advertising - I guess they get enough business!

Hours of Business : irregular, opens at around 11AM

Rates : $50 per hour (+$100 for nude HJ).

Age : mid 20's

Size/shape : Smoking hot and cute

Nationality or Ethnicity : Indon

Services Provided : Massage + nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : loved it but way too expensive

My experience/comments:
I used to work almost accoss the street so I went here a bit up to about 18 months ago - they had some beautiful girls here but they always charged too damn much. 

So I was on my own in the city with an hour to spare during our special new public holiday and I couldn't tee anything else up so went in on speck. I was determined not to blow too much cash but when Preeti came in I know I wasn't going to keep that promise - cute and sexy so I paid the $100 extra - she gave a pretty good massage followed by an excelent tug - up real close with her face lots of breathing on the knob. I really need to master the art of the sneaky cum explosion - that would have been a sight that would have (almost) made the cost worth it.
I think more be one offer for regulars but I can'r afford to be that so the whole issue is moot.

Cheers

Person's Name : Emily

Establishment : Urban Kneads

Date of Visit : September 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 373 Little Bourke St, Melbourne

Hours of Business : till 10pm

Rates : $65/45mins + $50 extra

Age : mid-20s

Size/shape : 12, D cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Spanish

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Not really 

My experience/comments : I found myself at a loose end in Melbourne and realised I was within a short walk of the U.K. shop I'd stumbled across six months earlier, so decided to try my luck again.  The first visit hadn't been positive (see #46).

When I arrived, there was a bearded dude behind reception in a convo with a couple of cute French girls; sounded like they were discussing the roster for next week.  I politely waited until they finished, hoping in vain I might score one of these jolies  mademoiselles, but as suspected, they were on their way out.  I requested a one hour massage but the beard winced and indicated they were closing in less than that, so I settled for 45mins -- just as well it turned out.

After making myself comfortable in the allotted room, I was joined by an olive-skinned chick in a dark singlet and shorts.  Chewing gum.  Noisily.  Not a good sign.  There was no mucking about after she confirmed I had been there before, asking if I'd like an HJ, and at least she didn't try and rip me off like the other ML.  I accepted, though wondered if I was throwing a good pineapple after bad.

My Spanish gum-chewer began a pretty lame massage and accidentally knocked over the cheap plastic clock she kept glancing at and busted it.  There were a couple of minutes that the clock did not register while she attempted futilely to repair it, before I told her to leave it.  Back to the massage, though she still seemed to keep checking the time, now frozen presumably for eternity.  The session improved somewhat after she stopped pretending it was a proper massage and began some tickling and stroking.  

I turned over and she sped up the jerking and tried to get me off before I was even semi-hard, so I had to ask her to ease up.  Emily had a fairly unimaginative technique and it wasn't doing much for me, as the minutes were ticking down (on my watch anyway, the clock was stuffed).  She didn't object to me feeling her up and I squeezed her good-sized bum and boobs.  I eventually sat up and focused on her ample rack while she finally got the hint that a sprint was not going to work as well as a more leisurely pace.  She even smiled a bit in between chewing her gum as I made small talk in between planting a few pecks on her cheek and chest.  Finally, it was all over and she seemed satisfied with her handiwork.

As I dressed, I noted we'd in fact finished more than five minutes early, but I wasn't fussed.  On my way out, I noticed the beard had a couple of tough types lounging on the couch behind to keep him company.  Their dull eyes followed me out of the place.  I only felt slightly uneasy as I hurried down the stairs and into busy Little Bourke Street.  Don't think I'll be back here but who knows?

Definitely not a fan!  First time was serendipity, ducked in to avoid the rain.  Second time was convenience and laziness -- I was staying nearby and couldn't be bothered walking too far or catching a cab.  Doubt there'll be a third time.

I would be interested to know if there are good quality RnT shops in the CBD.  When I had a quick scan of AXR on my phone before settling on U.K. the second time, I couldn't readily identify anything else more reliable.  Melbourne is certainly far behind Sydney CBD in the tugging stakes.

If your down again, maybe try Tokyo milk down Ackland st.  It has very attractive girls like Urban but the vibe is a little better -re the mafia management, although the prices for extras are similar to Urban.  You could pop in luna park afterwards too lol

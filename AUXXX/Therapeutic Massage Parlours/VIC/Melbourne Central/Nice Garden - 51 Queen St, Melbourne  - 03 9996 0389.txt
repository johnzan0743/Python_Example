My experience/comments : As I left Orchid the other day (see review) on my way home I walked past this newly opened place - flashing "OPEN" sign in the bottom of the window - could it be too good to be true?????

Yep. If you want a punt, or some cunt, give this the bunt.

But if you like friendly Thai girls who are studying English, who actually know how to massage, who use warm towels several times during the massage and who have a cute giggle - roll up!
Still some teething problems there - it's brand new - and walls that don't go to the ceiling mean that I once again laid down my hard earned to TOFTT - what a top guy, huh?

Saved you all buckets tho - I get a warm feeling inside about that......   ;-)

Cunt! Bunt! Seems nocturnalboy you lack a little respect for the ladies with whom we spend our time and money with. If future reviews of yours suggest a lacklustre experience I am guessing I know why?  Respect out = respect back times 10.

 Dropped in here on Saturday afternoon. I had reads a previous review of a few months back saying not much on offer here, and that seems to be still the position.
I was looking for a straight massage ,but a few extras would not have gone astray. Girl on reception was quite attractive .A Thai about 22 (later found to be Pam).She said she would do and that seemed promising. Nice welcoming smile and attractive face and figure. Shown into a small room, well setup ,clean everything, tissues and oils on the shelf.
I thought she said leave underpants on as she departed the room. Well I don't think you can massage that way, so I ignored that and settled down with a towel over my back. She came in and started a slow relax (which was what I asked for) and I must say it was very nice, almost put me to sleep.  No where near the boys though ,so I figured out this was not going down that path ; but we live in hope and I thought I would wait for the flip. She washed down the back with hot towels ad "turn over plis".
On the flip towel held up like a flag and then lowered full length from head to toe. The front was then massage though the towel. Hmm , we know where this is. She did a head massage (that is the body part above the shoulders), very nice then the chest ,through the towel ,then proceeded to pull my toes (toes that is).
Well we know now ,I don't think there is much point keeping this place in the non legit section. Good for a massage (although I have had better),clean and pleasant environment. Can't see myself going back. Interested to know if anyone else has had a different experience.

I suggest this thread may be able to be merged with the other Nice Garden thread as they seem to be the same place.

Lake @ Paramount
Person's Name : lake

Establishment : Paramount Health Spa

Date of Visit : 2/09/11

Contact Details : (03) 9663-6639
Hours of Business : 11am - 11pm

Rates : 60mins / 120

Age : around 29

Size/shape : 10 Natural 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : BBBJ, RnT, FS

Value for money/recommend? : Pretty standard rnt for 50 on first visit, as always about 2 mins into the massage the leading question "have you been here before?" comes up. Answering negative gets you silence till right at the end where a few subtle touchs on and around your cock get you the followup question whispered "Do you want massage here?" Answering yes gets you the very direct answer of $50? Which a bit of negotiation this includes her getting naked, On my next visit I decided to push it a little and was surprised that she allowed me to finger her without complaints. On Visit 3 i negotiated to fuck her for 150 bareback, after I came inside her she excused herself to "go toilet" which i took to mean wash her cunt out. Pretty lame fuck just stands there as you do her from behind.

Went there yesterday and guess who I got ??     You got it in one. Lake !!

Got the massage but when she asked for $50 for the hand job just stuck with the massage.
Good venue steam and dry sauna showers etc. had a shower and some steam . While I was in the steam room the young girl on reception decided to do some housekeeping in the men's. Mopping the floor etc unaware I was having a steam . When she saw me she took a hec of a long time to check me out!! I was hoping she would offer a happy ending but only my imagination going wild. Anyway all good. Will go back but need some names to try . Come on guys , share some info.

Person's Name : Lucy

Date of Visit : 9/12/12

Hours of Business :  

Rates : $45 / 30 min

Age : 45+

Size/shape : 10 (around there)

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Not for me

My experience/comments : 
Popped in yesterday as I had time to kill and was in need of a massage. Paid $45 for a 30 min session. After stripping down, an old lady walked in. Introduced herself as Lucy and got the massage started. She was probably at least 45+ yrs, medium length hair, 165cm. Wanted $50 for hand relief which I declined. Kept giving off a "pity me" attitude during the session, saying that she had no customers the entire day, only makes $10 per customer, how she wanted to be able to afford a house, etc... Older ladies are awesome, but I prefer ones that are 30-35ish that still look fairly young. Anyway, throughout the session, she kept asking if I wanted extra services, going down to $40 and then $30. She'd probably do it for $20 but she wasn't my cup of tea. Massage was average (didn't work on my neck and shoulders), attitude was meh (a bit pushy and gave me an attitude near the end when I kept refusing extras). I saw a few cute, dark skinned girls on the way out so I might pop by again to give them a try. But will avoid Lucy at all costs. Can anyone else recommend any girls?

Popped in again this arvo hoping for a better experience than last time. Asked the receptionist for a young lady masseuse before walking in the room. 5 min later, walked in a short, fat, and old lady. I immediately asked for a different girl, and 1 min later, the receptionist walked in and told me to leave and refunded me my money. Will NEVER be going here again unless I can get some good recommendations. AVOID THIS PLACE!!

My experience: I called in late afternoon, the receptionist was young and quite cute, she led me to a room behind the curtain, alas she passed the baton to an older lady well in to her 40's (Wei Wei I think her name was).  An excellent relaxing massage, firm and clearly quite experienced, no sign in the early stages of any extras.  On the flip, with the towel still in place, working the legs and then suddenly a look into her eyes and then she asks if I care for a HJ, yes, she says $50 I say $20 we settle at $30 and then the towl is released and then playtime begins,  no fuss, a nice pleasurable ending, she had obviously done this before - a good way to end the week.

I was at this place last month and had an old massage lady. She was built quite large too.
I told myself I will just get a massage and get the hell out of here.
During the face down part there was so much tackle tickle it wasn't funny.
Eventually it wasn't a tickle anymore and she literally grabbed my dick and rubbed.
Turn over time and she asked if I wanted a HJ.
I thought I could say no but the initial tackle tickle got me a little excited.
I did close my eyes for this part though 
Having said that, her technique was damn good - I guess the older they are the more experirence they have and they know how to do it.
I think it was $30 or $40.

[COLOR=#333333]Value for money/recommend?: No[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments: I drop by every now and then whenever I'm in the city. I really dislike the fat ugly chicks at reception though. I swear they are always eating when I'm there. I think it's $65 for 30 minutes but you really need a shower to get rid of all the massage oil. I've really enjoy Juna over the years but after my last visit I think I'm over her. You start out in with a shower and Juna will collect you and take you to a room. Face down and she'll oil you up for a nice hard massage. 

My favourite part [/COLOR] she'll creep and [COLOR=#333333]give you a nice tease around the balls and ass, raise your ass a little and she'll play with your fella from behind too. Flip over and she will give you a nice HJ with slow and different strokes [/COLOR] if will cost you $50 though. I paid an extra $50 for her to get naked (first time I took it up), but hell, all she did was lift he top and bra up, she has and pull she pants down. That's not good enough for my liking , so I sat up and sucked on her perky c cup tits, her nipples were erect too, she moaned and I pulled she panties down and started fingering her pussy, haha - it was wet, so I was able to get my finger right up there. She ruffed up as well, got half on top and pinned me to the massage table and started licking my nipple, all of this happened while her hands were still stroking my little fella too. It was too much and I made the biggest mess, coz she was leaning in/on top it come all over her as well. That should teach her 

She is fun but it's more about the money now. It's not worth the damage i say

My experience/comments : 

Having read about Janet I had to go see her - the massage as other people have said is superb, I like it v firm so she walked up and down and hit all the right spots.  Then the oil comes out and again she works all the right places.  When she gets to the top of your legs she does an amazing thigh/groin/cock thing that I cant even begin to explain - its just great.

Flip and the $50 OR $100 decision.... well I had to go the full hog - $100 for naked HJ, expensive but worth it on occasions.  She has an amazing figure, very fim and small but great tits which feel nice.

Unrushed and she finished off with a nice head massage.

WIR - yes, and have done a few times.

My experience/comments :
I hadn't been to this place for a good while, decided to pay a return visit as I was tired and just needed a good strong massage.  I met the receptionist, she was hot, young and well dressed, my mind raced...(now I wished she was doing the massage I thought hopefully).   All booked and into the shower room and to my surprise there were no other customers to be seen, then out into the lounge area and again no one.  Last time I was here you could hardly move it was that busy.  I waited in the lounge for a short time and then the massage lady called me into the room. Ella introduced herself, she was mature but kept her looks and beauty well, she had a nice body and a devilish look.  She proceeded with an excellent massage, just what I wanted.  She talked during the massage, it was an interesting conversation at first, but after a while she started talking about how hard she worked, for little pay, etc which was a bit off putting for me... nevertheless as we neared the conclusion she started to tease me around the nether regions, I knew she was wanting me to give her the nod.  I duly obliged after she really worked around my groin, I couldn't resist.  She was very well versed as she oiled and then stroked me to satisfaction.  Whilst an OK session, like everyone else it seems, I think this place is a little expensive and probably caters more for a good massage than anything else.

My experience/comments :

Decided to give these guys a second chance and so popped in again late afternoon.  Again very quiet, no sign of any other customers, as the price was inclusive I decided to detox and spent time in the sauna and steam rooms before the massage.  After 1/2 hour or so I showered and then went into the room waiting for my lady to appear, feeling great.  In the semi darkness Lucy appeared, she is mature and experienced but she quite attractive, with nice body and facial features (who doesn't look attractive in semi darkness!).  It was down to the massage, she immediately insisted I disrobe entirely - on my stomach and she proceeded to provide an excellent, strong massage, she stood up and crunched my back a few times.  She kept telling me how quiet it was, she had only one customer the whole day and it was a hard life without any money.  I could tell she was setting me up for something, then she asked if I wanted "special service". $50 was the asking price I negotiated down to $40 and she somehow made me feel like a real miser.  Was it worthwhile?, she was very good at HJ but I thought she was very mechanical, lacking intimacy.  Nevertheless not too bad, I quite enjoy the clean and modern environment even if the girls can be quite pushy with their attitude.

Been looking for a sauna & massage place. So been trying to get time for this place and suggest to friends if it was decent. Melbourne parking is "BAD", so i opted for 30mins to check place out. They showed me the rooms and sauna. Looks clean and nicely setup. Better overall then Royal City Relax.

Anyways, since only 30mins, had to go straight to room. In comes a short & chubby old lady. Did not have high hopes for rec from first impressions. Massage was medium with teasing. On flip she massage around then concentrated on little fella only. imo, she's giving a HJ and asking if u want one. Being first customer for day etc etc.. i just say may as well since she's getting me started. Oiled it up alot and rub around. Wasn't working too well, so i asked for a roam and she said if it helps. Took a while, but finally got there. Will try with more friends for sauna and hopefully more change of scenery.

My experience/comments :
Went on a lunch break at work to get a massage at Paramount, it's been a long time since going to a RnT joint and I actually had a bit of a crook back, so i thought why not. The place is much the same as I remember it; get changed and showered and shown to your massage room. The ML was a PRC and not that great looking but gave a great massage. Just before the flip, the hands 'accidentally' brushed past my boys a few times so I knew it was on. On the flip, I asked if she did a special massage and she said $50. I told her it was steep but she wouldn't budge on price and I didn't want to leave with blue balls. All in all, not a great experience and I probably won't go back anytime soon but if I do, I'll try someone else.

Services Provided : RNT + extras

Value for money/recommend? : Bit hit and miss

My experience/comments :
Decided to try my luck at this place - interesting to see when you walk into the shop you see signed statements with Victorian Police letter heads from punters stating that the place wasn't 'sexual service' orientated.

Yeah, right. Opt for the 45 min option and off I go, shower and sauna before being placed into a little room with hanging bar and a box of tissues.

Nude up, lay flat on the bed and a lady in her 30's appears - not the best but certainly not the worst.

Strong massage on the calves, thighs and even a walk along the back to get those knots out - a really really good firm massage that worked out the little niggles that I had (and actually originally wanted a massage for). Before long I was asked to turn over for a frontal massage. A towel was placed over my regions as the massage continued. With a blindfold covering my eyes I felt hands wander underneath the towel and start the obligatory motions leading to hardness. I make the necessary approving grunts and she continues on.

Next thing I know I hear the sound of her top coming off, and the snap of the bra. I feign ignorance and she continues her motions. Catbathing on the nipples was next and tongue action leads to her licking my balls, and then my shaft. No mention of prices and she commences a pretty good BBBJ. Lots of slurpiness between DT with not much wanking action by her hands. By then the blindfold was off and I was admiring her headwork on my little head. Not before long she's over the end of the table going hammer and tong on my member, with me kneading her ample boobs. I give her an indication that I'm about to go - which only hastens her actions and I coat the back of her throat as I CIM. 

Clean up done and I figured that I would give her a lobster as a tip, expecting that she'd go for a pineapple. But alas, she happily took the $20 and left.

So all in all, 45mins massage, topless, HJ, BBBJ and CIM for $65+$20 from a so-so woman. It's a pass mark this time!

Havent tried a city venue for ages so thought I'd give Paramount a go for the first time.

It's a nice place.

I entered the room, stripped off onto the table face down.

In comes Coco and puts a piece of paper over the little window on the door, what a give away for extras to come.

It was a good massage, not a huge amount of action downstairs.

Then finally she whispers do you want extras.

Initially I went with HJ for $50, but then went with the extra $50 to pull her pants down.

She had a great butt, which I luv with asian girls, gorgeous.

I tried to make her feel good with rubbing down below, while she pulled me off.  It would of been an extra $50 for fingers in the hole so I declined.

Not bad but pricy.

Not sure if I'd return.

My experience/comments : 
Open just 2 days ago, and I went there to have a look to see anything new. 
The place set at a old house with a 'for lease' sign at the front. 
It had two ladies available but one of them don't speak english well and old.
Cherry was surprise to me as she had a nice body and talk well in english.
She say she can speak 5 different languages. 
She ask for 50 with massage or 70 with nude. 
I pay for 70 and I could not stop touching her nice ass and flirting her body while she gives me a good massage. 
I told her that I need to turn around quickly as my dick is hard pressing against the table.
I ask for a FS but she say she want to know me more first. 
I was disappointed like a sad puppy so she slowly licking around my nipples and give me a very sensual BBBJ which I didn't even aspect for her to do so.
As much as she licking and tugging my dick at the sametime and i almost cum to her face 
It was fantastic for the first timer in this shop and I told her I will be back!
She told me that you better booked and her name is Cherry or Tina.

My experience/comments : Was passing by the entrance of this store and realize Izumi does lomi lomi, so decided to head upstairs and check it out. booked 60mins for a lomi lomi. i must say its a very good lomi lomi, and its by appointment only. was so lucky that the therapist has available spot when i arrived. 

good lomi lomi are hard to find, especially in the city. this venue is very clean, very new and so comfortable. all staff are japanese and tea being served at the end. unlike some other joints that advertised as japanese but uses chinese. Izumi is the real deal.

but just for straight massage only. nothing else.

You said nothing else was on offer. It would not be surprising if SHE didn't offer anything, especially first up.

Did you ask her for any extras?

Went here a few weeks back and had Mayumi. She looked around 25-ish and was slim and very attractive. Nice fair skin. I had a 60min 'relaxation massage' for $85. She was ok with me being nude and no draping. Bit pricy but the massage was very good, though nothing sensual near the bits that matter. The girl was chatty and her English not too bad and we had a good conversation. After a while decided to pop the question about extras (figured I had nothing to loose). She politely said "we don't do that here". I then quietly asked if she would be ok if I finished myself off. With a little smirk on her face she nodded and said ok just for you. She seemed to enjoy watching. I guess DIY in front of a pretty girl is better than nothing!

Called up on a whim & Honey was working. made way to reception & changed my initial booking from 45min to an hour for $10 more. Was only charged $5 for first timer promotion. 

Led to the room by Mamasan after showering, laid down commando & joined by Honey. While far from the BKK/Patts Go Go stunner I was hoping for, short young & cute is an acceptable substitute. 

She's obviously not money hungry or Very cautious, as hands were placed on the table rather than my default of hanging down the sides. I hadn't even initiated light touching but even if they fell down during the Massage they were quickly replaced. 

The massage itself was quite good, beginning with thai style over a towel at the beginning & progressing to oil. Focused on the legs as asked but no accidental brushes & always out of arms reach.

On the flip, the towel covering situation obviously meant she wasn't going to offer so I went ahead and asked, pointing to my cock & holding up 5 fingers. She nodded & removed the towel, standing closer & allowing me to grope her fine butt. Tug was the top notch style you expect at thai places - slow, skilled, 2 hands a twisting, then speeding up on the right moments. 
After the inevitable happened she grabbed the pineapple on top of my pile of clothes then led me to the shower before heading into the cold city night.

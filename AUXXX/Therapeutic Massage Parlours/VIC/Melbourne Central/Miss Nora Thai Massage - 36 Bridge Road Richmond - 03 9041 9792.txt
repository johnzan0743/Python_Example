My experience/comments : 

Had a little bit of time up my sleeve and this place had been on my list to check out. The TL;DR is I won't be back. 

Tara/Cara seemed pleasant enough, and gave a serviceable but not great Thai massage. Come the flip, there was a bit of coyness about her, and yes, she did offer HJ, it was $50 and no she doesn't do nude. I told her $50 was too high for clothed HJ, I would pay her $20, $30 max. She said, no too cheap and then became quite rude, suggested I go to other places where I can get that service for that price. At that point was tempted to to get up and say, thanks for the advice, I will, and walk out, but decided to lay back and let her finish the massage. Was glad I did, as she finished off with a really top notch head massage (of the above the shoulders variety).

She's right: there is way better VfM out there (and way better Thai massage too, truth be known. Won't both returning, but as always, YMMV.

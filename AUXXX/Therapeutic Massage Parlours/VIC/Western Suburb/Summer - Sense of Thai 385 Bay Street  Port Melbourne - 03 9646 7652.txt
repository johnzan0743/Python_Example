My experience/comments : 

I was leaving Melbourne, so wanted to see Summer one last time. Personally i find her figure a 10/10, swimsuit model style with B cup tits and a tight ass, lots of thigh gap, and a sweet pussy that gets super wet. However she charges like a wounded bull, I'm almost embarrassed to say how much. It's the normal (for this place) $50 for RnT, $150 for topless, $250 for naked. I normally only get the RnT because the rest is ridic. 

But it was to be my last RnT ever in melbourne, so I said fuck it. $250 for naked please. The massage was as always great, and there's plenty of time for casual touching, but she doesn't allow inside, and normally no DATY or FS. But this time, maybe because I said I was leaving, she gave me free DATY. She was as wet as an ocean, I've previously had her so wet she literally drips pussy juice, and this time was no exception. She let me eat the hell out of her, her clit blew up grape sized and she came twice before she made me stop (too sensitive). After this she gave me a BJ for a while and then a handy to finish. 

As I said, stupid expensive, but it was a bon voyage RnT.

Braunie, I like to think that the is a Great ML Karma Goddess who, every time some young buck pays $100 or $150 over the odds, puts those funds into a cosmic trust account so that good lads like you and I will have unexpected freebies and unbelievable offers showered upon us from time to time. So many thanks to our latest contributor.

My experience/comments : I had heard that this place may offer extras if you get the right girl. I got the owner...not the right girl it seems. Excellent massage, but nothing else. There are other girls there (none particularly young or hot that I saw), will probably return sometime and see if anything else is on offer from one of them.

I have heard the same but didn't get the name of the "right" girl.Apparently the odds are better in the evening.

Went to this place about 4 months ago. Got an excellent massage from the youngest girl working there that day and there wasn't even a sniff of a tug, she wouldn't even let me take off my undies even though I asked a few times. There was a guy on one of the forums saying how good this place was but I suspect that it might of been a friend of the owners. A rave review on one of these forums would be a sure way to drum up some business in the short term as all us suckers go check it out for ourselves.
The lady who massaged me even said that the same girls worked all day with no others coming in to work the night shift.

I believe it only occured right before closing after the owner had left, and the main girls who offered it have left

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 9078 6782

Hours of Business : 10am to 9pm

Rates : $40 for half hour

Age : late 30's early 40's

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : Very good massage, so yes. But no extras

My experience/comments : Was in the area after visiting a friend last night & thought Il scope the place out. Very good massage, proper thai style, but not a hint of any extra. Didnt get to choose out of the lady's available. I walked in at 7.00 and was asked if I had a booking. Said no, owner took me to where you get massaged (on the floor). Lady came in and told me to keep undies on. Even put a towel over my undies, so from that moment, I knew nothing was going to be on offer. But have to say, very good massage. Had a bit of a sore shoulder and it helped me a hell of a lot!

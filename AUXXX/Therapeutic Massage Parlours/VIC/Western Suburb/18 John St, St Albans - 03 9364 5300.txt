My experience/comments : Did not book. Went to the place and saw her and another girl sitting on the couch. Cherry got up and asked me if i wanted a massage. Asked me if I have been there, said yes. Went to the room, she asked for how long. I said 30mins. Paid first then told me to get gear off. New towel on bed. Massaged a bit and found out she was here for short time. Massage was ok, not firm but comfortable. Flipped over and asked if there were any other areas. Looked down and asked how much extra. 'Up to you'. Then ok and she got to work. Not naked but got to move my hand around a bit under the clothes.
Cutest girl I have seen so far.

Been a regular to a fairly new rnt located on John St St Albans the past few months. Menu there is reasonably tasty and despite the fact that all the girls there will tell u that we dont do fs here on you first visit, if u treat em well and become regular then anything is possible

Value for money/recommend? : yes but wouldn't recommend this lady

My experience/comments : had an rdo today so figured go get a rubdown from this joint. called up to make a 1hr booking and the lady didnt sound too keen on taking the appointment. plenty of parking outside, walked inside, there was a chubby lady that greeted me and said i got an hr booking, she kinda hesitated to take me in. took me to my room, got undressed, left my jocks on then straight on the bed. room was decent, bed wasnt that big but it sure was solid, didnt rock or make any squeaking noises. she started to oil up her hands and then started the massage, after a few strokes it was dry. told me take my jocks off which i was glady to do so. about 30mins in, even though her hands were soft, the massage was shocking, dry as fk, no technique at all, went to get the hot towel, cleaned me up ( O_o nothing to wipe off lol ) told me flip over. started to massage me softly around my D, had my eyes closed, got me worked up, opened my eyes and started to go flaccid then she told me times up. so i was like wth already, felt like it was only 40mins, so i asked her do you do any extras and she told me 20 for a hj, i took on the offer hoping it was better then the actual massage.. lubed up, very crappy technique, wasn't even rock hard. just closed my eyes and visualized until i blew. cleaned up and was outta there! ( coulda stayed home and did it myself but instead went for this disappointment)  got to my car and checked the time.. it was only 50mins.. first experience was a let down but i am willing to try another lady next time..

Person's Name : LuLu

Establishment : 21 John Street St Albans

Date of Visit : today

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 

Hours of Business : 10am-6pm

Rates : 40/30min, 60/60min

Age : 24

Size/shape : Average

Nationality or Ethnicity : Taiwan

Services Provided : massage with extra

I called up today, was told only 1 girl working and was told the prices for 1hr massage, so I decided to have a look as I have never been here before. Lulu was chilling out on the couch and I asked to book for 1hr however told me that only 1/2hr was available, which was a disappointment as I had travelled for 30mims to get there.
I was shown the room and very clean with oil heater, I stripped off and laid face down and Lulu returned from locking the front door. Her massage was average at the start and I told her to press a little harder however her one handed massage didn't change. 20mins in I ask her if there were any extras offered only a HJ for extra $20.  I should have known better but decided to take the offer, she told me NO TOUCHING whilst getting a tug! so it took sometime to get over the line.

Lulu came back with a hot towel to wipe down. Overall very average massage and straight forward tug for $60.... I could have turfed on a video, sit on my hand for 10min till numb and saved the hard earned!

Will I return : Maybe but not with Lulu and only when other punters post just the jackpot!

Happy punting 
Bushy

I saw the shop is listed in the "Domain" website.  Definitely closed.

I'm not surprised though.  You can't walk in the door of the place without the whole neighbourhood watching you.

Experiences: been out of the game recently, decided to hit this amp up. walked inside, was greeted by a early 40s lady upstairs. ushered me into the room, asked what i wanted, 1 hour, took my cash and told me to strip while she left the room. the room was very very spacious, mirrors, tables and a view of main road! after lying naked on the bed for 5-10mins she came back and told me to come to another room. was about to get dressed again but she said nar dw about it, just you and me here, kept looking at me and admiring my aesthetics.. lol so off i went. 

the next room was what seemed to be like a master bedroom, more spacious then the last, walk in wardrobe, ensuite the lot. hopped on the bed and away the massage went, firm strokes. i like my massage hard and yes she fulfilled that. after a few strokes here and there, i heard these clonking noises and you guessed it! it was hot stones, winning! oil + hot stones + perfect pressure = probably the best massage ive had in melb.. for a small lady her pressure was spot on. kept on kissing my back neck like she was in love with me or something haha

after the awesome massage was on the flip, asked if i wanted the d stroked and i gave in, i asked what else she offered and she anything you want, so i said fs, bj the lot and she said, honey im tired.. 1 hour stone massage very tired, next time ok haha. im like ok whatevers, settled with a cbj for extra 30. after that went for a quick shower, so handy. finished up, had a little chat about the next adventure, come see her and she will work out a good deal for me etc etc..

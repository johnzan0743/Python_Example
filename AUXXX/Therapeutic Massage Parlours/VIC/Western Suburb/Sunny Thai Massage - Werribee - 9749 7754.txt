My experience/comments : on my way home from the main street just happend to see a sign on the foot path saying massage . better have a look so i did . nice clean new setup .had a chat with Sunny about the price and service . home changed and back to TOFTT when i went back she seemed a little suprised that i was back payed the fees and she showed me to a room and told me to strip and get ready asked every thing and she said yes .looking good done as i was told and then a knock on the door in come Miss Alice and she starts of with the towell to cover me all the time she is talking with me about life in general and where she has worked and turns out she knows some other massage ladys that i know .after a bit the towell gets moved about and the oil massage is started which is good time is nearly you and no sign of more .cleaned up my back and legs with hot towells and flip over and she tells me 5 min to go would you like a head massage (golden moment i ask about the little head) to which i get a cheeky slap on the arm and told no in a frendly way ..but i feel with a little bit of bonding a HJ would be on offer so yes i will be going back to test the water again 
they have a few girls there i guess diffront girls on other days ..so guys if you go there take it easy and see how you go 
Happy Punting

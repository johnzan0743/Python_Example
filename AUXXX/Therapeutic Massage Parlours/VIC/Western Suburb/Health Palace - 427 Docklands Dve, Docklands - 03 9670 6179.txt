My experience/comments : So a mate had said there's a decent AMP in Docklands, Health something or something Health. I was there for work (and looks as though I'll be there a bit more) so I did a bit of exploring and came across this place. Went in, and as soon I saw the setup, I could only figure it was legit. Undies on, no separate rooms. Top massage though.

Does anyone know of any places in Docklands that offers extras?

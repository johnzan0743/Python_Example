Person's Name : Tina

Date of Visit : July 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 286a Ballarat Road, VIC, 0432 613 904

 Hours of Business : Not sure, google says 11 till 5.

Rates : $100 for 30 minutes

Age : Early 30's

Size/shape : About 5'3", long dark hair, size 8 with C bolt ons, nice shape proportions without being fat, looks pretty fine naked

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai I think

Services Provided : CBJ, FS

Value for money/recommend? : Fine if you want a quickie

My experience/comments : Rang the bell, waited about 2 minutes outside.  Shown into a room by Tina, who took the $100 I handed her, nodded and left me there for about 10 minutes to finish another job.  The room was very hot, I turned the heater off.  Table up against the wall.  She came back in, nuded up straight away and rolled the dom on with me about half hard.  CBJ for about 3-4 minutes which got me 3/4 hard.  Good technique for what it was, a warmup.  If I return I'd want longer and without the raincoat.  Then she lubed herself up and lay on her back on the table, which is still against the wall.  I'm in... a few positions later (mish, standing mish, doggy), a couple of moans and verbal encouragements later, she gets up, pulls off the dom and finishes me with some oil and a hand.  No objection to some FIA during that.  She is pleasant enough, but it is what it is and I was out of there exactly 15 minutes after she entered the room and closed the door, it was on me to make any difference to that.  I didn't feel enough of a rapport with her to try and see what else she has in her bag of tricks.  Nothing against her but I've had a far better time there with Jessica.

This was on a Sunday.  She said she works other shops around the area on other days.

Does anyone know if these are the same shops? Looks like one might have an incorrect address? 286a and 288a Ballarat Rd.

Definitely saw Tina at 286a, the one closer to the city.  Amy worked at the other one.

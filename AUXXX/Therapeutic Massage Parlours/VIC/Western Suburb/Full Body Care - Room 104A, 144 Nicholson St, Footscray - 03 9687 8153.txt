Have not been there for a few years, so I thought I would tray again. Misty was an average looker, in her 30's or 40's. Her english was good. For $70 she stripped off, and although I would not call her pretty, her skin did feel smooth. Not much of a massage, and ended up with a decent tug.

My experience/comments : Have had a couple of visits to this place this year. Can't remember the name of the first girl. She was fairly restrained in her service but maybe that's because it was my first visit to the venue. 2nd trip was the total opposite with Angel whispering in my ear re full service in the first 2 minutes. She was in good shape for her age but I settle for a CBJ. Some mutual play first to get in the mood and then on with the franger for an experienced CBJ. I blew in the condom (is that CIDIM, come in dom in mouth?) and she cleaned me up. It was a busy place so I expected to be ushered out quickly but she then gave a nice head and shoulder massage for the remaining 10 minutes. 

This place is upstairs in the Hub Arcade (Nicholson Street mall) so the entrance is a little more discreet than most of the Footscray places. CHeap as chips and handy for a lunch time quickie.

My experience/comments :

I was in the area and thought I'd drop in and give this place a try...being off the street... up stairs.. it has a quiet discreet entrance.

Walking in through the door I was greeted by Misty and taken through to the room. There was one other girl there... didn't get much of a look at her.

Misty isn't what you would call attractive... but not unattractive... for her age, maybe mid 30's not a bad body... nice enough to get you going.

Her massage was reasonable, maybe a bit soft but it was sensual enough with a lot of tackle play to get you up and running.

On the flip she asked if I wanted nude... she stripped off and allowed my wandering hands to have a decent play...I'm pretty sure with her reaction more would have been on offer if I'd asked.

Misty started the tug on the flip.. did a reasonable job....got me off.. and then continued to massage for the time left.... things weren't rushed.. she has a pleasant personality and speaks reasonable English... she works there Monday - Saturday and mentioned there was a different girl with her every day.

Overall it was a pleasant session and I'd be back the next time I'm in the area.

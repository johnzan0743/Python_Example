My experience/comments: Saw the number in the local paper. Rolled up, it's a little bit away from the shopping part of Alfrieda Street, and knocked on the door of an unmarked house, with a security camera above the entrance. There was no answer. A few minutes later a woman carrying a shopping bag arrives and lets me in. The place was messy, and I could hear other people inside talking. After waiting for a few minutes, she asked if I wanted full service. I declined, and asked for massage and oral. $70.

She led me to a very dark room, and Na came in. Although not unfriendly she was very brief. She undressed and kept moving so I wouldnt see her body. She gave me a very poor brief massage, turned me over and had to start wanking me to get me hard, that's how unsensual the experience was. Then she slipped on the dom, and gave me a CBJ.

Overall very rushed and not sensual at all.  This place might be better for FS. I reminded myself to avoid Vietnamese places. I'm sure that there are good Viet ladies but I haven't found them and my experience has been cold rushed and unsatisfied service.

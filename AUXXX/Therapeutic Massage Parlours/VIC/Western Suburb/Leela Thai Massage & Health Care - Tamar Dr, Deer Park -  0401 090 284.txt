My experience/comments : 

rocked up to this private home, a man opens and told me to wait in the room she'll be right with you. the room was decked out with thai bling. she came in and asked what i was after, i told her i wanted hard pressure, thai it is! she gets into business right away. this feeling.. i havnt had since i went to thailand. she was so strong, cracked every backbone in awkward positions, so if youre after a strictly good massage, you should try this place out. felt like i just came out of a thai MP. will probably be back when im in need of strong hands! she was very nice, easy to talk to.
finished off with a burning oil on my back to relieve some pains. (thumbs up)

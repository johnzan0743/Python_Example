Value for money/recommend?: OK

Thought I would try this a few weeks back. The girls are young there. I got Debbi, who gave me a decent straight massage. At the end I asked her for a towel to clean off the oil, and she said she doesn't do that - she thought I had asked for extra. It was obvious during the massage that it wasn't going to happen.

WIR? Not really, I prefer the older experienced ladies for a straight massage who really know what to do.

Have scored a few times here, friendly crew, but you must get the right girl otherwise action is out of the question.

They have a high turnover of staff too.

Gents , 

Have called in too here regularly from December to Feb ,

Linda was my girl of choice, offering a substandard massage with RNT for $30, super cute and eventually allowed touching but she has now moved on.

The other person i can confirm is Josephine, small cute Taiwanese girl, 24 yo fun and attractive, rnt and touching allowed. last saw her in Late Feb, 

My second last visit their they were using me to train a girl how to tug. super weird  experience, I tried to turn it into a double tug but the trainee insisted on just watching, could not get over the line that day.     

On my last visit i was told by the masseuse that she never offers that service. walked out embarrassed. did not get her name sorry.

My experience/comments : 
Hi Fellow Punters,

Last Saturday, I feeling the need for a quick punt, nothing more than 30mins.  Anyhow in the interests of taking one for the team, I saw this new MP setting up not far from me, so thought I would give it a try. Appeared to have just opened for the day.  There was no real business cards, advertising (apart from the generic massage and LED open signs).  Didn't really matter as she didn't speak more than a dozen words of English.

Walked in and asked for 30min massage.  I asked how much and she said $40.  What is it about Asians that they also know what you are saying when it comes to money???  I only had $100, and I was shown to a room as she went off to get some change.  I had an idea that I would try to get her to earn some of it back. hehehe

She comes back in as I am lying on the table and she passes me the change, for which I put away.  She asks me soft or hard, and I was in the mood for a medium massage and told her so.  

Massage not bad, and as she was rubbing the back, I made sure to softly rub the back of her legs.  My sign to say that I am hoping we can work something out later on.  As she gets to my legs, she is really getting into running a finger slowly up and down my bum crack.  Bingo, extras on the menu boys and girls.

15mins in, and asked to flip.  No problems, and with all the arse crack play has mini me out and proud and ready to play.  As she is spreading oil over the front, she definitively didn't dodge my cock, and in fact gave it a little attention.  She moved around to the other side of the table, and started to really get into the HJ without me saying anything.  However shortly in, she turns to me and say do you like?  Well I don't know about you - you can't exactly say that I have had better....., so tell her yes.  She says that I need to pay extra.  I say how much.  She asks for $50, and I say $20, and she quickly drops to $30.  Agreed.  Now how much nude?  She wants another $50! Forget it and get back to work, however as she is working away I let the hand wonder, and soon she is standing next to the table with her pants around her knees as I am palm deep in Chinese yaya and the other hand has undone the bra and was feeling a very small pair of tits.

Fresh tits and yaya always has me popping early, and so after 5 - 10 mins of above average attention I was done and starting to clean up.  Paid the extra, got dressed and left.  Not a bad start to the day.

Thank you for your review Air Travel.

Looks like the name and probably the phone number of this business has changed.

If someone will post the new phone number I will update the thread.

Person's Name :   Amanda

Establishment :   Lotus Day Spa

Date of Visit :   25/02/2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :    3/533 Mt. Alexander Rd, Moonee Ponds VIC 3039    T: 0431 433 676

Hours of Business :   9.30am to 8.00pm 7 days

Rates :   $40 / half hour clothed massage + extras

Age :  25 ish

Size/shape :   Size 8, a-b cup I would guess  never got to confirm!

Nationality or Ethnicity :    Vietnamese

Services Provided :      Massage only

Value for money/recommend? :    No

I will make this fairly short as the experience not that memorable.  Amanda gave me a pretty decent massage though she covered me both front and back with a towel and no hint of extras throughout. She was pretty quiet and didn't really want to engage. She said she was the only person on however there was a much older WL that I saw when I left.  At the end of the massage she asked if I wanted HR and when I asked how much she said $40. No clothes removed, no touching. When I tried to haggle it down (unsuccessfully) she said most normally paid $50 for this. Well good luck to them. Politely declined, got dressed and left.
PS  Our Sydneysider friends must piss themselves reading these  reviews if they bother; we are getting ripped off blind down here much of the time.

My experience/comments : 

In the area and a bit toey, so I thought I would try this shop. Absolutely sensational stunner on reception, Indian at a guess, but only reception. I needed to shake the snake, was shown to the bathroom out the back, and passed by the two girls working. One tall, slender, but not really attractive; the other was a rumpled sphere where shoulder, neck, and head all kind of blended. Finished my toilet duties, was shown to the room by stunning receptionist, and Katy came in -- the non-spherical one.

What followed was a pretty average massage for 25 minutes back and front. She then says, there are five minutes left, would you like anywhere else massaged? Initial price was $50 for a clothed handy and $100 for nude. I ended up getting her down to $50 for topless (she was on her period) which does go to show that haggling can work. The display rack wasn't great and neither was the handy.

Won't both returning, and you live and learn I guess.

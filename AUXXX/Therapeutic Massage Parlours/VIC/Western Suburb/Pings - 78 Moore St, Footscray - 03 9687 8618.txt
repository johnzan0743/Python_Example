My experience/comments : Had heard about this place and i happened to be in the area. Dropped in around 7.30pm and greeted by a friendly 40 something PRC. 30 minute massage, no problem, $30. The place is very clean and taken down the hallway to one of the rooms, only downside is the ol' curtain door. Was very quiet though so no real issue. Stripped off and waited, a few minutes later she returned and commenced what was the best massage i have ever had. Hit all the right spots, firm, and then all of a sudden she was standing on my back. There are rails built into the ceiling which she hangs onto as she moves up and down...was fantastic. Almost forgot about being horny and needing a release! I asked about her doing nude and was told no, but wasn't fazed. Eventually the flip came, more great work and the enevitable HJ question.....i said yes and offered $20 which was accepted. Wonderful hand technique got me over the line pretty soon. Clean up with hot towel, dressed and thanked her very much. All in all a very good punt.

My experience/comments: 

Was quite surprised that a review for Bodylinx isn't already on this site the place has been open for years.

This was my first venture into Bodylinx, I'd known of it for some time but the expense of the place kinda turned me off it. Charlie is very, very accommodating and gives a top notch service, she is bubbly and easy to talk to. Her massage technique is 9.5/10 and she really works on providing a very good sensual service on the flip which i would rate very highly. Physically I would guess she's about 5 - 11, b/c cups, blonde and a bit curvy but certainly not over weight. What I like about this place is being given a choice of girls and the shower facilities afterwards.

WIR - Not sure but was definitely worth the first visit.

I saw Charlie recently as well - August I think.  She provided a good service and let me pop twice at no extra cost.

I've also seen Renee there, European (Polish from memory), she's pretty much up for anything.  I fondly remember fucking her hard with two fingers while she blew me to completion.

Bianca was the other girl I've seen there, slightly larger type with the biggest set of tits I've ever had my face between (not fat tits. BIG tits).  That was over a year ago so not sure if still there.

I've found at Bodylinx the service is excellent and superior to Bodyline in my experience.  Girls are extremely accommodating and it's a friendlier, warmer experience.  Downside, they're all getting on a bit, only seen a couple in the intros under 30.  And of course, you're paying a premium compared to the Asian r&ts or FS places nearby.  Don't have the odd stunner like Bodyline does too and there's less to choose from.  Still, if you land the right girl, you can have an incredible time.

 Bodilinx Footscray - Charly
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Charley

Establishment : Bodilinx

Date of Visit : December 2012

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Bodilinx Adult Stress Relief Studio - Melbourne

Hours of Business : 10am -  7pm Monday to Saturday

Rates : $120 for 30 minutes

Age : 35+

Size/shape : Very tall & slightly curvy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian

Services Provided : Massage, hand relief, reverse body slide

Value for money/recommend? : Yes but a penny ore & it would be to expensive.

My experience/comments : I turned up to Bodilinx in Footscray about 11am. It is located in Cowper St a dual carriageway road set among factories & other businesses. Although it is legal it does not offer discreet parking & I had to walk past prying eyes to No 149A.

Once inside I was greeted by a sexy looking receptionist who I would have loved to book on the spot. She ushered me into one of the rooms told me it was $120 for 30 minutes & that full service was not available. In came the ladies. Bianca who was a bit overweight for my liking, Olivia a bit surly who offered no extras; short Jane who offered oral for $30 extra & very tall & ebullient Charley whom I booked for 30 minutes. The receptionist t returned took the $120 gave me a towel & told me to shower.

I had only been in the shower shortly when Charley returned to rub my back down. After finishing drying in the room Charley started to disrobe & asked me to remove her underwear. Once I had whipped them off we embraced, cuddled & I sucked her tits while standing next to the massage table. She was very talkative during the proceedings while she oiled my back & played with the back of the tackle. On the flip she went into a reverse body slide into 69 position & she worked on the hand job while I took in the view of her nether reaches. Needless to say I blew like a volcano.

Charley lives south east of Melbourne & only gets to Bodilinx once a week. If you want to book her ring ahead rather than just turning up on spec. At $120/half an hour Bodilinx is at the maximum range of what you pay for anything short of full service.

Age : 19 (as she told me) 

Size/shape : 10/C cup

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australia

Services Provided : bodyslide and HR

Value for money/recommend? : yes/maybe

My experience/comments : 

I rang bodilinx to make sure I did not have to book. When I got in there, the lady opened the door and gave intoduction what service they offered. After that she brought me in 3 ladies one by one including Charlie. The first lady looked young and sexy. So I chose her. Her name was Brooke. She told me to have a shower first. The first thing I nticed about this place was so clean, towel everywhere and very professional. 

She was very friendly, blonde long hair. Very chatty, friendly but I noticed that she did not tease a lot. But I still enjoyed her massage. Ten min before she asked to turn over, she did a body slide. It was so good. Up and down all over my back body. 
At the same time she breathed on my ear. Very sensual. 

After then she asked me to turn over. She teased little bit then started 'the action' and then over. I should say that she was a new comer maybe when if she works longer, she will get more experience. However bodyslide with her was so good.

I saw Brooke a few weeks back too.  Gorgeous surfer chick looks with long blond hair, nice body, my type of girl!  Gave a very sensual bodyslide and accommodated my requests including tit-sucking.  I think she has some room for improvement but I still left beaming.

WIR - Bodilinx is dear but worth visiting once in a while for the guaranteed good service.

Date of Visit:September 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: Bodilinx Adult Stress Relief Studio - Melbourne 149A Cowper St Footscray

Hours of Business: 10am to 7.30pm – Monday to Saturday

Rates: $120 for 30 mins, $170 for 45mins, $220 for 60 mins

Age: Mid 20's

Size/shape: tall, great womanly figure, tattoes, peirced nipples

Nationality or Ethnicity: Australian

Services Provided: Nude Massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend?: Very good values for money and recommend.

My experience/comments: 

Selected Bree from three girls, she has a warm friendly approach and I could tell from the handshake she is very tactile.

I jumped into the shower and then waited for Bree. She returned after 5 minutes, and stipped. She was keen for me to lie down on the massage table, but I had a good look at her as she undressed; great body, nice tits – pierced with rings and a trimmed pussy.

Massage started with pretty standard stuff, but she soon opened my legs and climbed on the table. Lots of body to body, her hand underneath and she was happy to rub her pussy on my leg.

The flip and Bree massages me while standing up next to the table. Happy for me to caress her bum and tits. She is now back on the table kneeling between my legs massaging my chest and starting to flick my cock and balls. I sit up on the table and massage her boobs – she likes this, but need to be very gentle. I lick her nipples and start sucking them slowly – she is humping my leg and I am getting a very wet leg from her pussy. Gently and suck pull on the nipple rings and she is getting hotter and wetter.

Time is up, so here comes the HJ and she is very good – I blow a good load which makes her very happy! Me too!!! A longer booking with Bree and I’m sure pussy massage, her orgasm and even DATY could be on the menu.

Great facilities, always clean showers and towels, and smells good. An interesting selection of girls – pays to call ahead to see who is on – the receptionists are good and happy to give descriptions of the girls.

WIR – Yes. I have been visiting Bodylinx for several years and have visited Charley many times, even last Wednesday!

Person's Name : Jade

Establishment : Bodylinx 149A Cowper St, Footscray, VIC 3011

Date of Visit : 21-12-13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Bodilinx - Adult Stress Relief Studio

Hours of Business : 10 till late

Rates : $170 (30 min) incl extras

Age : Mid 20s

Size/shape : C cup? Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Caucasian 

Services Provided : Spanish, CBJ, DATY

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : After running some errands in the Western Suburbs, decided to head to Bodylinx in Footscray. I was quickly introed to the 2 avaliable girls, Jade and Crystal, and chose Jade who was much more my type.


Into the the room we go and she is absolutely stunning naked. Extras were offered for $50 including touching, CBJ and DATY, and I accepted without hesitation. We start with the usual back rub, not the best, but quite decent. Finally, after the flip, we started getting down to business. After a bit of spanish, and eating her out, the best part of the booking was the CBJ. She is really good, and went quite deep! Soon enough, I couldn't hold it any longer and came, and so Jade finished up with the rest of the time with a massage.

Great session, would definitely return again to see her!

Person's Name : Savannah

Establishment : Bodilinx

Date of Visit : Mar 31, 14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 149A Cowper St, Footscray 

Hours of Business :  10am - 7pm

Rates : 120 - 30 mins

Age : Around 30?

Size/shape : Curvy

Nationality or Ethnicity : South American

Services Provided : Rnt

Value for money/recommend? : Not for Savannah .

As a usual to Bodyline and Num 100, I decided to go to Bodilinx for the first time. First impressions was that a 'home' rnt i.e. no waiting area, reception area, etc. Instead the waiting room was just in a room, which I actually thought was good since its quite discreet.
Anyways, it seemed like the options for number of ladies available was not great (only 2 - but it was during the day). Of the 2, I chose Savannah for 30 mins, who honestly was not my type, but after traveling the distance to try the place, I decided to stay. Boy, I regretted this decision very soon. While she seemed nice/friendly throughout the session, she told me to get on my front at the start of the session and after a bit of a chest massage, she started with the tug. At first, I thought it was just some teasing, but soon the pumping got harder and I came. She then told me to flip over for a quick back massage and some tickling, and soon she called the session over. Overall, the session didn't last even 15 mins. WIR? Definitely not for Savannah, maybe someone else, but this first experience has turned me off so maybe not for a while.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Bodilinx Adult Stress Relief Studio - Melbourne 149A Cowper St Footscray

Hours of Business : 10am to 6.30pm  Monday to Saturday 
Rates : $120 for 30 mins, $170 for 45mins, $220 for 60 mins

Age : 25

Size/shape : Tall. Enhanced D cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie

Services Provided : Nude massage, bodyslide, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : I was cashed up and in the area so thought I'd give Bodylinx a go. at $120 for 1/2 an hour it's super expensive when compared to the many dodgy rnts in the Footscray area. I was introduced to Charley who I'd read many good things about on the forums and Frankie who I'd read nothing about at all. So Charley was the wise decision but Frankie looked much younger so of course I went with her. Had a quick  shower and then waited a few minutes. She's a great looking girl with a kinda new wave (partly shaved) hair style. She was very friendly and made me feel right at home. After a little bit of chat and massage it was down to business. Lots of sliding on my back and her large enhanced boobs felt great as they massaged my bum. I was quick to flip to get a feel of them on my front. We had lots of fun. And then I blew my load.

It is a bit on the expensive side but I'm planning to go back and see Frankie again some time soon. When I'm cashed up...

Age : Mis 30s

Sophia Bodylinx

Bodylinx is a legal establishment in a small timber house at 148a  Cowper St Footscray  offering everything except FS. Basic service is nude massage, body slide & HJ for $120/30 mins.

Couldn't park outside their building so had to walk a considerable walk of shame to enter the premises from where I parked my car. Possibly you would not have this problem at night.  There were a considerable number of factory workers hanging around but the place id legit so there is nothing anyone can do about it. 

Apart from the parking problem Bodylinx ticks all the other boxes for cleanliness, good looking girls.

Mamasan, possibly a Maori  met me at the door & 6 girls came in individually to introduce themselves. All were well presented.  It appeared that things like touching, fiv would be an extra $30 & $50 for CBJ etc.   I chose Sophia a curvy blonde.

She returned promptly while I was drying myself  after the shower. She proceeded with the rubbing & body slide & then asked me to flip. She was on top of the table at my feet while she oiled up the virile member  & fired me off.  A pretty lacklustre performance  stilted conversation, no real effort put in that would want me to return.

I can't really recommend this place  a legal place needs good discrete parking. Would not recommend Sophia.  Obviously the selection of girls is very hit & miss particularly  when there are no other review to by.  I might have picked a different one & would have had a much better experience. Compared to other legal establishments Bodylinx while ticking most of the boxes represents poor value for money. First time at a new place I normally go for the shortest amount of time  &basic service. I don't upgrade until the 2nd visit if the 1st was good value.

Would be interested if any others have had a more positive experience here.

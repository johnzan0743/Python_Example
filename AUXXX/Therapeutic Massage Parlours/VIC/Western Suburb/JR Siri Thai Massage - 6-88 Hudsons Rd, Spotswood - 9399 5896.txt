My experience/comments : I had slept awkward the night before so was fairly out of kilter.  I was working around the corner so decided I'd TOFTT as I couldn't find any reviews.  Made a booking and arrived at the allotted time.  I was met by Linda at the front desk who asked what I was after and we settled the financials.  I was led to the first room where I was instructed to undress and hop under a sheet while leaving underwear on.  She returns a few minutes later and adjusts the sheet and begins a genuine Thai massage working out all the knots in my back.  Unfortunately the sheet stayed on and was just moved around and that was that.  Not a complete waste of time as I needed the proper massage but no punting here and I left with blue balls.

My experience/comments : dropped into get some cash from the atm today and noticed that there was new asian massage place in the area and thought why not. Although i was a bit skeptic of the place i thought at the worst i could get a good massage WRONG...
The lady seemed a little bit shocked when she walked in and my boxers were off quickly covering me witha towel and making sure it stayed there for the duration of the session. I was a little disappointed as tug would of been nice but it thought oh well a nice massage would be ok. The lady tried to work out my back but ddint really put the effort in. I asked for oil she stated that was 15 bucks extra WTF... Would i return no there are alot better legit massage places out there

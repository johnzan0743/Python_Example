Person's Name : Joanne

Establishment : the white house on the corner

Date of Visit : 15/1/13
Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 23 Napier St, Footscray

Hours of Business : 10 - 8

Rates : $60 / 30min, she was nude and had no hesitation getting her kit off. I only had nude RnT for the $60 but CBJ would probably only be another $20. I'll try it next time and post the results

Age : about 40

Size/shape : 8 small tits / big nipples

Nationality or Ethnicity :Chinese

Services Provided : R&T 

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, money talks

My experience/comments : Had seen Joanne before at a previous place in Richmond. She is small and has a tight body for a woman of about 40, hides her age well. Very keen to take the sexy gear off and go straight for my member. I only had R&T but the way she held it close to her face, I'm sure next time with a few extra $$ she would do CBJ. I hope to get there again soon but enjoying trying some different places at the moment around town.

Thought I would give this place a try on Saturday.... windows shuttered up.... front door locked tight... door bell not working... no answer when I tried knocking... does anyone know if this place is still up and running ? Not sure if it's worth taking another trip back to give them a try.

Yeah i know it's been closed for a long time. Do you remember the Indian lady who used to work here? I'd like to know if she's working somewhere else now. Very nice lady!

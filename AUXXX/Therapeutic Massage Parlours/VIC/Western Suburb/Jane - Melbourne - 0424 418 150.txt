My experience/comments :

Having a lazy day at home and saw Janes ad on Gumtree. Normally 100,  down to 49 ...what the hell I thought, at worst Ill get a cheap massage.  Sent her a txt, asking if she provides sensual massage? Yes...but  sensual but NOT sexual. Hmmm...ok , I booked anyway.
Jane turned up on time laden with massage table and bag with towels etc  which she quickly set up. I stripped off (no jocks) and lay down. She  offered to cover me with a towel (declined) and she proceeded with the  massage. I didnt find it sensual at all actually bordered on rough a few  times.Nonetheless she is obviously well trained and an experienced  masseuse. While massaging my thighs she got close to the nut sack but no  touches etc...
Flipped over, no attempt to cover my man hood and massaged my front in  the same way as she did my back. Nice work on my inner thighs but still  no touches and no sign of any thing extra.After exactly an hour she  informed me the massage was finished. Packed her gear up and off she  went.
By no means the worst massage Ive had and for $49 I was happy. Although  no chance of any extras on this occasion I had the feeling if you were a  regular with her there may be that option at some stage.
WIR? I wouldnt pay 100 but for 49 I would book again.Decent massage.

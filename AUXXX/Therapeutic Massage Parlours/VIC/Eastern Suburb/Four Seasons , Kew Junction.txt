Saw this shop at the North East corner of Kew junction next to a pizza place. You go upstairs, the place is clean and has few rooms. Two asian girls working there Nina and Patricia, they have a another shop in Lawrence Street Blackburn. This one is a month old. Booked for an hour no covering of towels, the girl was nice enough but we don't go there just to see nice girls, she was very careful not to touch the ghoulies. Like slowing down to go around them when going to that area. She loved to massage the bum though. I threw out the 'extras' card about 30 minutes in but she politely said no. She went and got the hot towel and did the clean off slowly, what are we in the country?! Was like 2 minutes to clean down the back.

Turnover, and started to cover with towel but I said wasn't necessary. She had trakkies on so i took my liberties and started to rub her wop ass which she didn't mind. After a while I thought i'll ask her if I can DIY, she said it was ok. She happily continued the massage while I did it. Thought about aiming for her, but was just a fleeting thought. Anyway so no extras, but I have no doubt that there would be extras available there from some of the other girls. Same holiday visa thing. 

As a bonus they have a nice clean shower for a quick rinse. 

WIR: yes but to PUNT on someone else.

thanks for the review raxel. sounds like this one may be worth another shot to see if extras are possible with another girl. how was the massage though? $59/60min is pretty good value - if the massage is good. I'm often in the area so may give this one a go.

Massage was nothing special, typical untrained stuff. I can try the other girl next wednesday, forgot to mention they also gave me $5 off voucher for next visit.

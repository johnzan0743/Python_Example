My experience/comments: 

Driving past earlier on and felt the urge for a bit of relief I thought I would go in and try this place out. Couldn't find any reviews of this place but the shop front was a typical rub n tug place with covered windows and flashing sign.

Parked out front. Unfortunately the entrance isn't very discreet near the traffic lights of busy Glenferrie Rd. Went in anyway and there were two youngish girls sitting playing with their phones - one slim and one a bit curvier. The slimmer one which I later got to know as Yoyo got up and greeted me, showed me to the room and took my money before leaving me to strip.  Looks wise Yoyo is quite attractive with a nice figure and youngish looks. I think she may be older than she looks though. She didn't smile or show any enthusiasm which is disappointing

Once in the room I knew it was going to end in a tug later. It was dimly lit with nothing on the table except cheap baby oil and a box of tissues.  Nuded up and didn't bother with the modesty towel and she didn't put it on when she came back.

Massage was ordinary with a bit of pressure here and there, a few chops around by back and a few strokes. She did play with the ass and tackle a bit to let me know it was on after the flip.

On the flip and no messing around. She asks me if I want extras. Asked $50 for a tug, I said no a bit lower, than she said $50 for nude tug which I agree. Her body looked older than her face - B cup breasts drooped a bit. For some reason I imagined a tighter body. I have to stop getting my own expectations up.

The tug was ordinary. She stood at the end of arms length so she didn't want to be touched too much. Then she went to my dick like a jackhammer. No technique or sensuality about it. Was going to take me a while this way so reached up maximum reach to feel her breasts and ass to get me over the line.  She cleaned me up with a hot towel and left me on my way.

Probably won't go back unless someone reports back with another girl worth returning for.

The other girl i saw wasn't much of a looker in my eyes. Yoyo said she's only there Friday so there may be better options on other days.

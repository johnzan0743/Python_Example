Hours of Business : 10am to late,

Rates : $70.00 for the hour No Extras

Age : Mid 30s+

Size/shape : Nice body  but untouchable
Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Great Massage

Value for money/recommend? : For a great massage yes but the Police Raid option I can do without.
Made an appointment for Thursday lunchtime to sort out a hip and lower back problem created in the gym the night before. Have been to this place a few times as it has always seemed totally legit with no extras on offer, but then I had not asked either.

Jenny gives a great massage really sorts the sore spots out, she knows what she is doing, but does not do extras (I think). Her English is not the best but you can generally make yourself understood, a little patience may be required. She works Thursdays and Saturdays.

Anyway was just finishing my massage when I heard these loud voices at the foyer saying this is police officer so and so, we have had a complaint about sexual services being offered in this establishment. I am quite sure the girl on reception had no idea what he was talking about or at least acted that way. Anyway was getting dressed and listening to the disturbance outside, Jenny goes out and comes back in confirming the police are outside. The police officer is asking to see all the girls and the person in charge, and the girls are saying they have customers to which the police officer says don't worry about the customers!

Anyway I walk out of the room feeling quite apprehensive to about 5 ML's and 2 male police officers. The young PO not talking to the ML's comes through the front door with me and asks if I will answer a few questions to which I said of course. He informs me they are following up on a complaint regarding sexual services being offered at this establishment, to which he asks me how many times I had been here,  I say a couple of times, and then he asks if I was offered any sexual services, I say no, and nor did I ask for such services. He said fine and that was that, I went on my way and he went back inside.

Drove past the place on the weekend and noticed it was still open, which would suggest it was just a warning visit, might be a good place to avoid for whatever massage you may want.!

Rather funny that the police are involved in that with all the other issues that have happened in the last week.

Seems to be the way at the moment with  blitz on massage shops etc..

Like all things the blitz will pass and we can all get back to punting without a concern of being questioned by the police.

Another great achievement for the incumbent government- cleaning up the massage industry for 5 minutes, what a waste of time and money!!!!

Person's Name :   Ruby

Establishment :   Ashburton Relaxation Therapy

Date of Visit :   16/01/2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :   197 High Street Road, Ashburton Victoria.

Hours of Business :   10am to 8pm

Rates :   $70 for 60 minutes

Age :   35

Size/shape :   10 with B Cups

Nationality or Ethnicity :   Chinese

Services Provided :   Massage

Value for money/recommend? :   Yes/Yes

My experience/comments : 

After visiting a friend at Cabrini Hospital I found myself held up in traffic, so decided to shout myself a massage. With no parking available outside the shop, I drove into the Shell servo next door, filled the car and asked the guy if I could park there for a short while. Gives the ok so I walk the 20 metres to the shop and book for 1 hour with Ruby. Very nice and clean shop, with large enough rooms and lockable doors...could have been a Thai place with fresh flowers, scented air and big fluffy towels on reasonably large massage tables.

Ruby walked in as I was getting on the table and covered my arse with a towel, proceeding to administer a medium to hard massage which was exactly what this customer required. Now Ruby is no oil painting but I found her to be most pleasant, caring and willing to converse if that is what I wanted. Ruby is a solid lady without being fat, about 160 cm with medium length dark hair, with cute facial features. She has a good command of the English language...in fact she reminds me of Ruby from Elgar Road...so I had to ask if she had worked in Box hill or surrounds. No was the answer !!

Ruby's massage was sensational verging on being painful at times to periods of bliss, and I complimented her on her skills, noticing a blush of pride appear on her face as I lifted my head. At about the 40 minute mark, she climbed on top using her knees and forearms to iron out the few last kinks and then asked me to flip. At this stage there had been no incidental touching of my privates so I decided to ask about extras as she placed a towel over my dick. Ruby was massaging my stomach and chest at this time and quietly said sorry, I don't supply a sexual service, but I can get another girl to help you. While saying this, her massage of my stomach had moved way south to my groin under the towel and the top of her hand was caressing my shaft. I asked her to stop massaging there as I was aroused and Ruby said you can do yourself so I can watch !! Funny girl...no way. She laughed and left the room for some hot towels, cleaned me thoroughly and showed me too the door with a hug and ' Come back soon, please.' I will...there is something about this lady !!

Ruby works Saturday and Wednesday.

My experience/comments : Visited this shop next door to shell servo on saturday evening on entering was met by Amy dressed in cut off denim shorts and see thru top. I was shown to 1st room and asked to wait 10 mins. Room was clean with rails attached to roof above massage table. When Amy returned i asked for a hard massage which she did a reasonable job involving walking on my back and some body slides using her bare legs on my legs and backside which got the desired result of a hard on. She asked me to flip and offered clothed hj not touching or top off and touching of boobs. I took the clothed hj as i was not really attracted to her, the hj was excellent with good technique and no rushing all up a good massage and hj to top it off.

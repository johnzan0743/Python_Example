This open front shop inside the Brandsmart outlet is right opposite a cafe.
So the patrons have a pretty good optic on the comings and goings.
Rang up and booked an early session - was told Dora and Sophie on. I liked the sound of Dora and booked her.
Got a text on my way saying she was going to 30 mins late as she was using public transport.

Got there and the guy says no Dora on today just Sophie. Saw a rather sturdy looking 25ish chinese girl and said ok.
3-4 cubicles with curtains not doors. Sophie comes in I say hello and when she does not answer lift up my head and look at her
and say hello again. She seems a bit of a zombie - expressionless and basically nothing going on in her head. Ok she says.
She doesn't ask how I want the massage just starts and this is the laziest masseuse ever. One handed and no apparent idea- chopping and changing body parts like she doesnt know what she is doing. I am on the verge of walking out but stay and finally the massage is over.
She has used a lot of oil and gets a wet rag to wipe my back and can't even do that properly and misses heaps. 
Summary
crap massage
zombie masseuse
no privacy

My experience/comments : 


Saw the joint some time ago as it's within walking distance from the train station.


Intel says Cat(or Kat) is the ace here so I went there and asked for Cat, stating a friend recommended her.


She asked me to change the room before starting the session, one with a basin. Seems like a good sign.


Massage was OK but wasn't really getting any sensual until very last part of it so this part was bit boring.


The usual hand sign for HJ offer happened after flip but interestingly she seemed care about another guest in the next room?


So asked to me keep it quiet. 


HJ was not bad, she didn't mind some touching and rubbing etc. tho it wasn't getting anywhere better. 


Unloaded and went my way. WIR? maybe.

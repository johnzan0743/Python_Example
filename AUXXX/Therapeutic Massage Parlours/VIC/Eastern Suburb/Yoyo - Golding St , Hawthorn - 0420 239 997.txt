Person's Name : Yoyo

Establishment : Private Apartment 

Date of Visit : 12/04/16

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Hawthorn, 0420 239 997 (http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_7...You-Happy.html)

Hours of Business : 11am - 8pm

Rates : $80 HJ

Age : Somewhere in the 20s

Size/shape : 8-10 and podgy 

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : HJ, BJ & FS

Value for money/recommend? : IMHO, this chick was not good value. WIR? Nah, unless they employ some hunnie-bunnies.


This joint is a short drive from my workplace. And it's near Bunnings so I can tell the boss that I'm just shooting out to get some materials for a small home DIY project I'm working on (I'm building a fucking machine).

Anyhow, schlobbed down to the apartment today and met Yoyo.

I could probably sum up the whole experience as follows:

"I lay on the table. She flogged my knob. I fucked off".

It truly was that perfunctory! 


However, I'd probably get flamed for not giving enough detail so I'll expand a little:

Yoyo is a podgy PRC chick, nothing much to look at, who basically is full of bullshit. I was short on time so I tried to negotiate a price for a quick 15 minute shake-hands-with-Yul-Brenner but she wasn't up for it. When I asked to meet the other chick she spun some horseshit about her being busy. When I turned for the door, suddenly, hallelujah, nothing is too much trouble. In hindsight I shoulda hit the road and if I hadn't been carrying a loaded musket I might have just done that.

Just a quick tip here. I'm pretty dam sure the towel on the table hadn't been changed for a couple of months. It was definitely looking seedy. I'm sure there was cheese growing in the folds. So, when she ducks out to stash the cash I very deftly swap it for a freshie from the stack underneath. Well, I'm assuming they were fresh towels. Anyhows, anything would have been better than that other disgusting rag. I nearly threw up.

Anyways, she starts playing with my yoghurt rifle but it's not reacting. "Not good?" she asks. If anything was gonna happen I needed to see some clam so I asked her if I could have a Captain Cook. No problem. She's got a sparse bit of bush down there and these funny marks on her arse. Either she's had her childhood vaccinations there while the quack was checking out her arse or she's previously worked in the Shanghai BDSM industry; maybe someone spilt the hot wax.

I'm starting to come to attention, mainly cause she's pumping my goo gun like she's gotta get home to cook hubby his tea. I'm still pretty much like a half-boiled bratwurst but anyhows, some short time later, I give her the gravy.

Now the pressures off she's all happy and gives me the price list for next time. Body slides, blow job and FS all on offer. I tell her I'll be back next week to consummate the marriage but, as you've probably guessed, I won't.

This place has moved several times, from Victoria st Richmond to off Victoria into Flockhart st and now to Hawthorn, Golding st.  The mamasan has ordinary girls here, but also Momo who works Friday is ex Catwomen June.

There are several reviews in different threads.

so this is the ex shop I saw 19 year old coco on Victoria st near those abbotsford highrise apartments, that's interesting.  From meeting yoyo, and seeing the other girl mike, I'm also not overly confident we will find a young fs type here, but u never know.

Back in nov 2014 i reviewed a sweety named coco who i saw at 609 victoria st abbotsford.  This shop is still running, and the mamasan opened 2 golding and 1136 whitehorse rd box hill.  Her contact is 0406071666.  I ran into her a few weeks back at the box hill address, and she asked me if i was the one who loved to see coco?.  I told her "yes", and she told me she is back.   She told me coco is working at 2 golding on tues and 1136 whitehorse rd on thurs.   After trying both venues and missing coco, due to early arrivals, i started to wonder if the mamasan was just trying to lure me into falling for another one of her girls.

Today i tried golding st again, and arrived 30 mins after opening, and walked to the front steps, then saw coco, and walked past her in shock. You see when she left the business, i was pretty sad, but in a way relieved due to how sweet this girl is.  Today i rang the bell and wanted to just pop up and say hi to this adorable girl, but in the end i decided to give her 30 mins of my time.  Coco is now 21, and still sounds like a 5 year old girl, when she talks.   I didnt need a massage today, but seeing her in a tight pink windcheater, short black skirt, and black pantyhose looking so adorable as she does, i just needed to catch up with her, as she did a hard massage.

Coco's eyes are doll like, but her hair looks a bit ratty, and she has small gaps between most of her teeth.  She is the sweetest girl ive ever met in this industry, and i just couldnt do anything sexual with her again. She is still studying music at uni, she plays the piano, and  I wouldnt mind punters checking her out, but once she starts talking, i couldnt imagine u could do naughty stuff with her.  With 3 girls working here this tues, i knew she wouldnt be busy, and basically donated her money today.  

If anyone is interested in seeing coco, i will pm u the apartment numbers.

Person's Name : Amanda

Establishment : Private Apartment 

Date of Visit : September, 16

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Hawthorn, 0420 239 997 

Hours of Business : 11am - 8pm

Rates : $80 (including HJ) 

Age : Somewhere in the 20s

Size/shape : 8-10

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : HJ (not sure about anything else)

Value for money/recommend? : Good value

WIR: Yep, I want to feel her hand on my cock again


I swore I'd never hit this joint again but here I am, the tragic fuckin' punter, with a half rigid salami in my pants, buzzing the apartment to let me in (pleeeeeeeaze, fuckin' hurry up, let me in!).

In my opinion this outfit is as dodgy as hell (the towels haven't ever seen the inside of a washing machine, the fuckin' carpet is sticky and the room stinks of seedy sex, farts or jizz or some bloody thing). But it's just so damn convenient. I can tell my boss I'm shooting out to see a client and spend a good half hour here getting my knob throbbed.

I'd rung ahead and got wind of a new chick, Amanda (at least new to me).

Door opens and, fuck me, it's my nemesis, Yoyo. Into the room and it's like 'Ground Hog Day':  I ask to meet the other chick and she gives me the standard shit about her being busy; when I ask again she says the other chick doesn't do full service (bloody hell, you'd need to have a couple of dozen coolies scrubbing this place for a week with hospital-grade Domestos before I'd nail anyone here); when I say I'll come back she immediately yells for Amanda to get her arse into the room on the double (well, she said it in Chinese but I'm pretty sure that's what she said).

Surprisingly, Amanda is quite attractive in a girl-next-door kinda way, maybe in her mid-20s. She's carrying a bit of padding but it's not out of proportion; it suits her. She must have realized I was in pain. I was standing, half-leaning on the massage table, still fully robed. Without saying anything she glides up and starts undoing my trouser buttons and then my fly. Fuck, that was a major turn-on. Cock-zilla awakens. All my reservations about this place suddenly evaporate into thin air.

My dacks and jocks drop to the floor. The beast is released. She presses right up against me, arm around my shoulders, hair in my face, massaging my anaconda. I can smell her honey. This is hot and I'm definitely bothered. Instantly my hands are cupping her comely arse, trying to get access to her cans, fondling her cooch and all the while I'm licking her neck and gouging her ear with my tongue. All this in a matter of seconds.

Her hand is like a machine pulsing my wang and I cum like a fuckin' freight train. In fact I have to grab her hand to stop her milking me anymore, I just can't take it.

She washes the goo off her hand. I pat my Willy Wonker with some tissues and the moment's over. I've only been there 15 minutes, tops, but that was better and hotter than a lot of longer times I've spent in these types of joints in the past.

Amanda works Mondays only, so she tells me. See you there next week.

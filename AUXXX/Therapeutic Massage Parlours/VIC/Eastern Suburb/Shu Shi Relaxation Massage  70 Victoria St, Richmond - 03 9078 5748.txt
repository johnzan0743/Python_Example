Darn Melbourne's weather. One day is 35, the next one is 15.
 I decide to warm my body up with a nice massage, and I return to this newish Richmond place that I noticed one day from my car. On my last visit I received a wonderful treatment from Anne, a really good and firm massage, and I'm looking forward to repeating the experience, maybe with the addition of something more, if I get lucky.
  I enter and I ask specifically for Anne. Mamasan says something in her language and leads me to the very front room. I repeat: “Anne?”, “yes-yes, fifty dollars” it's the answer.  
 Uhm, I start being a bit dubious, I didn't pay in advance last time, so I depart with a yellow note and lay down reluctantly on the cold massage table.


 After few minutes, in comes the ugliest old thing I've ever seen. I try hiding my repulsion, and I say for the third time “I'd like to see Anne?”. “Yes-yes” she says, and a moment after I think “Oh well maybe she just forgot something in the room...” she oils my back and starts the massage. O-M-G. What a rip-off.
 Now, I have to say, I was sort of warned, and I should have left the room when I heard another punter giving me not-so-concealed hints that my choice was busy with him. In fact, I could hear him repeatedly saying “that's nice Anne / my shoulder is a bit stiff Anne / you're really good, ANNE”.


 I just close my eyes and I pray the lord of Asian Parlours that experience comes with age... but my silent holy chant is wasted: this lady sucks. And big time too. At cheap AMPs, masseuses usually learn how to give a massage from a DVD. She clearly doesn't watch TV. I mean I don't even bother asking her name, because I'll never see her again, that's for sure! Mamasan calls her Jenny, for that matters.
 Another sure thing is that I'm close to hypothermia: the last room of this place has a A/C unit right on top, which blows nicely and directly in the room, but the first one, close to the front of the shop, is Mr. Freeze's holiday house, and I'm no Batman.


 I beg her twice to cover me with towels, I'm literally shivering. Then she tells me to turn over, and the funny thing is that she places towels all over me... except on my crotch. I'm thinking “you must be dreaming if you think I'm going to give you more money after ripping me off and making my poor fella turn into an icicle”. So I look firmly at her and I shake my head left to right multiple times.
 As an answer, she reaches for my jewels and starts oiling them. What kind of irresistible man-eater does she think she is?!? Or maybe she believes that we are dumb beings who can't say no when stimulated. I'm very nervous at this point, so I raise my voice and I spell out “NO-thank-you”.
 She stops immediately, clearly upset. After a very quick wipe of the body, she leaves saying the massage is finished.
 I feel I should ask for my money back, a shitty massage and from the wrong person after I specifically asked for someone else.  
 But Mamasan is clever, nobody is in sight, the little desk unattended, the corridor emptier than beer stubbies on my best Friday night. I leave highly disappointed and that's a shame, 'cause for $50 an hour, Anne gives a massage that professional, highly renowned legit establishments don't deliver for $85+.

I have to agree with you, you "should have left the room". I certainly would have! That sounds like a complete waste of money. At least you know the next one will be better!

My experience/comments : With no intension of venturing inside I was passing by this shop and wondering if it had been reviewed as yet. When passing, a 40 something well groomed slim Asian lady came to the door and looked up and down the street. From the other side of the street I caught her eye and she flashed a nice smile and a little wave, that was enough for me to venture across and say hello and be invited in. Her grasp of English was nil, so any conversation re time and price wasn’t working and was met with another smile and being ushered into a small room separated from the corridor by a curtain. A minute went by and I then realised that maybe I was to start undressing. I got my shirt and my shoes off, then a different 40 something well groomed Asian lady popped though the curtain and after seeing me, said something to nice smile lady which seemed to be in the tone of ‘back off this one’s mine’. New lady knew two more words of English than nice smile lady. So stumbling conversation meant I parted with $50 for what I thought was going to be a 30 minute massage. I was feeling very non-Tiberius (new adjective) this time in liking the unknown of what more could, or could not be, on the cards. Anyways, all was routine, with me lying face down with the massage being medium to firm. A short while in, a mobile phone rang from the corridor and the loudest conversation in the world took place just outside my door (curtain). I was just about to ask for her to be shut up when the call thankfully ended and the place returned to normal. New lady’s  technique wasn’t bad, starting on upper back, lower back then legs. Time was ticking by and I could sense my ‘wants’ were changing, also thinking that my lack of clear negotiation at the start was now not so smart. Then asked to flip, a towel was placed over the bits and then she starts at my neck, after a little while I then realised that the $50 was in fact for an hour. Chest, arms and lower legs were taken their time on and then I noticed a little more of a sensual approach on my upper legs, reaching under the towel and brushing the good bits. Next was my stomach and now obvious bushing of the good bits which showed signs of enjoyment. The hands then gestured if I would like massage ‘here’ and soon followed by 4 fingers being held up. I signalled 2 fingers and we setting on 3 fingers. The HJ was very good, ball cupping and long strokes with just the right amount of oil. My hand felt her upper leg and her nice ass, and upon a bit of closer inspection I noticed she was wearing little shorts over her leggings. It made me remember that nice smile lady was wearing some trendy jeans. To me, these were 20 something clothes on 40 something women and they both carried it off very well. Soon I was emptied and was delicately cleaned up. Then not yet being time a head massage followed and then time was called. I got myself dressed. Paid my 3 fingers and happily went out the door. Would recommend.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 70 Victoria St Richmond ph:9078 5748

Hours of Business : 10am - late

Rates : $50 hour + $20HJ

Age : 20s

Size/shape : size 6

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RnT 

Value for money/recommend? : OK  fair

My experience/comments : 

Went to this shop as was in the area and the GF was out shopping so thought I would do a detour and go and check it out.  Went in the shop greeted by the massamum who is sitting at her little desk as you walk down the entry past the rooms whcih have curtains for doors.

Asked for massage, she said I can have 1 hour for $50  so I said fine.

Was greeted by a young tiny chinese girl,  probably a 4 on the likeability scale.

She tell me to take my clothes off while she goes out ( usual routine) and while I am lying on the table she comes back in and ask whether I like it hard or soft, I go for hard. She uses a small amount of oil not too much which is good.

She goes through the routine of trying to give me a firm massage, is just OK but not really to my liking, she hops up on table and tries to do stronger but she is too small LOL  anyway we eventually get to the flip,  now at this stage there hasn't been any accidental brushing of the fellas so I am not sure if I am on a winner. Anyway I am watching her as she rubs my legs and she has moved the towel so I am just showing. she looks at me and motions for down there, I nod yes, she then holds up two fingers for a lobster and I nod yes.
She proceeds to apply oil and use both hands to eventually allow me to blow over my chest. She cleans me up smiles and finishes off the massage.
Now while she was doing the deed I tried to manoeuvre my hand on her butt and legs but she kept on positioning herself so I couldn't do this.  So I gather she was only happy to do the HJ but nothing else.

I give her the lobster after getting dressed and away I go   deed done for a total of $70.

It was passable and not bad value, not sure I would go back unless there were prettier girls or I could get more.

Rates : 50 Hr (20 HJ)

Age : 40

Size/shape : med

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : OK if you like a bit older and want a rub as well as a tug

My experience/comments : One of many RnT places in Victoria St.  Still trying to figure out which is the best.  This one has a series of booths, with curtains.  About four ladies working there, none of them students what I saw - all around 35 plus.  I saw Candy, not a bad massage, started to stroke me lightly, and mimed a handjob.  Asked about the price, was $20 plus.  I offered her $30 if she let me feel her tits - they were a good size, with decent nipples.  She's not a petite Asian type, more a Asian MILF.  Didn't ask for full service, and think it would be difficult given the lack of space/privacy etc

Overall: OK for the money,  Will investigate the others to find the best

Read treva review and had to check it out. Wendy was the only girl working at the time as it was late. I was her last customer of the day. Really good massage, got rid of all my knots in the back and alot of teasing. Flipped and she started rubbing up and down my legs slowly which got me really going. Wendy came to my ear and whispers 'do you want a happy ending?'. I asked how much and she said how much do you have, I had only a $20 and she accepted. Great handjob, slow and she got her rack out. I came whilst my hand was cupping her tit. Great experience.

Rates : 50 Hr (20 HJ)

Age : 35

Size/shape : med

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Superb massage, no touching her though

My experience/comments : 

Popped into this place after dinner out with mates in the region.  It's a small narrow shop with just cubicles and curtains, so I can't imagine you'd get much more than a RnT.  

Phoned first to see who was available and Anne was free in 10 mins so grabbed a beer and watched the crowds whilst waiting.

Now I have never been here before and didn't even know if the lady I got was actually Anne, but some reviews indicated she was great at the rub which is what I was after primarily.

Going by the quality of the massage, it must have been Anne because it was bloody fantastic 

Pretended to Anne that I'd been there before, in fact what the hell, even pretended I'd seen her before just prior to Christmas.  Figured she'd had to have seen 100's since then and who could remember them all 

Anyhow, was able to get an oil up on the flip and a nice long slow tug.  Cleaned up and continued with massaging the upper body and head.

Stayed mostly out of reach for the tug part of the session, so I'm guessing there's nothing more on offer.  

At $50 for the hour, the massage alone though is enough to return for.

Value for money/recommend; I guess


I was in the area having my car washed on the corner of Hoddle st and Albert and decided to get a leather refurb which was going to take 45 min.  I thought I would stroll down to Victoria St and get a quick massage.  The first place only had one women on (it was about 10.30am) and she was busy, so I walked along to find Shushi.  I haven't been here before but what the heck I was just there to get a quick massage and HJ.  Again one women working but there was no one else around and she was free.  I didn't care about her looks or age.

Started off with a very good massage on my back and I was just enjoying having my body rubbed. On the flip she asked if I wanted a HJ, and said $20 (on top of the $40 I paid).  It took a while to get me over the line as I wasn't that horny looking at her, but her technique was very good and you can tell she has had plenty of experience.  I mainly closed my eyes and thought of some young sexy girls, and job was done.

Overall, for $60 I can't complain, I got what I wanted ie a good massage and a HJ.  

BTW, Magic Hands (the car wash), did an excellent job.

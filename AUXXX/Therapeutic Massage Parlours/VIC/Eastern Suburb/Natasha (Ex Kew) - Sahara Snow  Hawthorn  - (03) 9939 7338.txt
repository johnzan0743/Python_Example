As mentioned in another thread Tash has made a move to this new shop whic only opened this month.
Tash's attitude and friendliness was great - she showed me into a room - no shower - however she said that she was organising a room for her that would have one
On the bench face down - beautiful lomi lomi with lots of arse hole strokes and lots of under body st rocks of cock and balls.
On the flip she provided a great whole of body service with a great finish.
I just paid her what she used to get at Kew - even though I think the base rates are lower,it was worth it to me.

I'm guessing $90 for the lomi and about $100 for extras...that's what she asked for when I saw her I think. Pricey but worth it!

Post Content: 
Person's Name: Jessica

Establishment: Sahara Snow

Date of Visit: 10th March 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: (03) 9939 7338, 617 Burwood Road Hawthorn   www.saharasnow.com.au
  Hours of Business: 10am to 10pm,

Rates : $75.00 - $80 for the hour plus extras

Age: Mid 20’s

Size/shape: Short, very slight girl

  Nationality or Ethnicity: Filipino

Services Provided: Great Massage, Excellent HJ

Value for money/recommend?:  Well after many years of going to my local Contours, have now found a new local, Sahara Snow. This place has been open for about 6 weeks I think, and have noticed it on my way to work each day. Thought I would give it a try, and am more than pleased I did. Looked them up on the web, found a good web site that allowed you to make a booking. Within minutes you receive a confirmation by text and to your email address advising you of the time and the therapist. There is a place in the booking area to make special requests such as the ML. You also have to advise what type of massage you require, from lomi lomi to deep tissue to relaxation or a combination. I requested the combination.
  I arrived on time and was taken by the receptionist to a waiting area which is a small cinema with large chairs and a huge screen, which was showing a Michael Buble’ concert. A couple of minutes after sitting down Jessica comes and greets me and takes me to a large massage room that is well set up & clean with a comfortable padded massage table. Jessica is dressed in a super short uniform that zips up the front. I strip down while Jessica leaves, hop on the table and within seconds she is there to start the massage. The massage is very strong, this girl obviously knows what she is doing. We start to discuss the massage and I ask about the lomi lomi to which she says would I like the balance of my massage to be lomi lomi as this is the most popular massage for this establishment. I can’t refuse. Am asked to hop of the table while she removed the towels to leave a vinyl covered table, she them pours oil on the table and I am asked to lie back down.
  As she gets into the lomi lomi I start to feel her legs and suggest she should be naked to avoid oil going over her clothes, she immediately say that will be $100, including HR and touching, and then says she needs the client to suggest this before she will take her clothes off. Once her clothes are off she has a pleasant body very slight but in proportion with pointy tits and long nipples, all very enjoyable. As she is massaging and I am touching her nothing is off limits except I am asked not to put my fingers inside her bald moist pussy. The massage continues with lots of touches in the best places, then the flip comes and the massage just gets better with a long slow HJ, while feeling all Jessica’s best parts.
  After the massage I was offered a shower, which was clean with plenty of soap to clean of the oil.
  Jessica works on reception during the week and is massaging on the weekend, but she fills in for massage in busy times. Would I recommend; most definitely.
  Now I know this is expensive but, we have classy place with what appear to be quality girls, who have fixed charging schedule, clean rooms, a good shower and a top massage. I don’t mind paying for a quality service. If you compare this to Contours there is no comparison….!

Driving to work this morning I saw a fire truck outside this establishment with the front door smashed in. Their website states they are closed until further notice due to unforeseen circumstances. It's a pity as although expensive it is a gozod place to go as you know what you will get, a good massage and generally a good level of extra.

Hot towels taken from dryer and left in a pile caused an auto combustion situation. Just saw the reports via the web. Damn fine place Sahara Snow. Shame to see it go "up in smoke" pardon the pun! Who knows when it will reopen. 
Watch out locally and see if the girls relocate for a while until this place gets back on its feet!

This is off topic. This is a review thread please. 

You should use the search function to find places...there are around 7 or 8 brothels in this area that will accommodate you.

The silence is deafening. Normally she pops up after a couple of months R&R. Not this time, haven't heard a peep . She supposed to have gone interstate, but not so sure about that. Maybe she has gone cold turkey and hung up the tissues for good.

Person's Name : Bella

Establishment : Sahara Snow 

Date of Visit : 4/7/2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 617 Burwood Rd, Hawthorn - 9002 1367 / 0490 076 005

Hours of Business : 10am - 10pm

Rates : $60 (current special usually $70) for 45min + $30 clothed HJ

Age : early 30s

Size/shape : Slim, Beautiful 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Average

My experience/comments : 

Free time on my hands so I call up and make an appointment. They're already busy so it pays to book. Only option for the time I wanted was Bella.

Entrance isn't great if you're looking for a discrete entrance on a busy corner and no covers on the windows so you're in full view even after you walk in. Walk in and the owner is at reception with a good looking lady (look like from the Caribbean). Very nice guy, have a chat and he shows me around and sits me in the lounge area - TV still not installed. Bella walks up and greets me soon after. Classic beauty face with her hair tied up wearing a red top and black pants. Shows me to my room and leaves me to strip.

The place is very professional looking, relaxing atmosphere with proper solid massage tables. Walls are thin though and I can here people in other rooms. Since this is my first visit even before the fire I'm hesitant but strip anyway (I guess the worst they can say is put my undies back on). She walks in and covers me up with a towel. A bit of chit chat and asks if I've been there before. I say yes before the fire which makes her relax a bit. Takes off the towel and oils me up.

Massage was a bit weird, combination of pressure and relaxation. There's a few accidental brushes but nothing to say it's still on after the flip. When I do flip she covers up little bot with a towel - bad sign. So I close my eyes, relax and enjoy the rest of the massage. When she reaches the top of my head and reaching over to massage my chest her breasts hover close to my face and I open my eyes. At this moment she looks and me and gives me THE smile so I pop the question. She says she usually doesn't do it but for me she will (yeah right). 

Oils up little bot and goes to work. Technique starts of ok but soon after she starts hammering and making it unenjoyable. I ask her to slow down and to her credit she does. Not great but after some time I explode. She offers a shower or towel clean up. I choose towel since the sink is in the room. Clean up and I give her $30. She didn't negotiate before this but I guess it's the going rate in the area. She asks again not to tell anyone because she doesn't want to do extras for anyone else. Unsure if it's true but just a warning if she declines anyone else.

Enjoyed my time here. A upper class RnT joint but will have to check out other ladies to find a favourite. Bella works here only Tuesdays.

For those in the outer south east the owner says they're opening a branch in Dandenong within the next few weeks.

Person's Name: Sophia

Establishment: Sahara Spa Previously Sahara Snow

Date of Visit: 10th July 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink: (03) 9939 7338, 617 Burwood Road Hawthorn

Hours of Business: 10am to 10pm,

Rates : $75.00 - $80 for the hour plus extras of $100

Age: Mid 20's

Size/shape: Strong Girl/ great body, small boobs

Nationality or Ethnicity: French / Caribbean

Services Provided: Great Massage, Excellent HJ

Value for money/recommend?:  
Well after nearly a year this place has re-opened and is offering the same great service albeit expensive.

Arrived at 10:30am without an appointment to meet the owner talking to the girls, probably 4 or 5 of them near the front door, asked for a combination massage (Thai & Lomi Lomi) for the hour and charged the $80.00. Then started talking to the owner who took me on a guided tour pointing out the changes since the fire, he also went to great lengths to explain how the fire occurred.

After the tour was seated in the waiting area waiting for Sophia who took me by surprise as I was not expected a milk coffee looking princess, a very attractive lady (in my eyes anyway). Sophia takes me to one of the new rooms which was warm and extremely comfortable. I was asked to undress and then waited. After a few minutes the action began.

The massage begins with a rub down the legs and back to the bum passing by the boys on the way. About 5 minutes in I was asked if I wanted the special massage (nude) or the extra special massage that included the body slide. I chose the special massage to which she wanted payment straight away, which I thought was the only downside to the experience. The massage continues it is firm and of a good quality, she did legs and back thoroughly occasionally rubbing or touching the boys on the way through. In the meantime I am allowed to touch anything but the cat. This girl has a great bum and really strong upper thighs, her boobs are small with nice button nipples, a really nice package. We chatted for most of the massage with her French accent a bit of a turn-on. Then the turn and again the front of the legs, chest and stomach are all given attention before an excellent HJ.  I then had a nice hot shower in a spotlessly clean shower. A great experience. 

Sophia works Mon, Tues, Fri & Sun. Some of you may have come across her in a place in Dandenong. 

As a final point the owners are opening a place in Dandenong imminently and Essendon in the coming months.

In summary a great unrushed experience but a bit expensive with extras at $100.

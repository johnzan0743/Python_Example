Was in the area, so I'd thought I'd go scouting since we haven't had a review from this place yet. The place is pretty big and clean, and they have an EFTPOS maching there ( So any guys thinking of using the EFTPOS trick to flee the scene won't be able to ). This was already a bad sign for me, seeing that they seemed like a legit massage center. But because there are no reviews, I thought I'd take one for the team. 

Came in and was greeted by a short cute girl, with big yellow teeth. Hmmm........ Luckily another girl comes out and asks if I needed any help. This girl was very pretty, very slim and about average height and long hair. Turns out her name is Joyce. I book her for 30 min and damage was $60 and she leads me to the room.

The place is pretty new, the corridors were clean, and the rooms are probably the most clean massage rooms I've seen run by Asians. She asked me to take off my clothes and she'll be back with towels. Do the strip and she's back in time and starts the massage.

Since she had good english, I started asking her questions to probe her without really asking "THE" question. Asked her if she had any bad experiences with customers, to which she replied there are a lot of perverts out there..... LOL. I asked if she lived with friends here, and she said she lives with her Scottish bf. Pretty soon from the answers I knew that this was gonna be a legit massage, so we just ended up talking and joking around for the entire episode. Got to know that she wanted to become a barista back in Taiwan, but it was too competitive, so she ended up working here.

The massage was pretty good, and I'd recommend that if anything.

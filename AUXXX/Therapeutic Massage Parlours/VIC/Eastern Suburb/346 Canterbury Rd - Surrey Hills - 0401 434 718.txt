My experience/comments:
Found a new place on locanto and since it was close to me and since I hadn't seen this ad before I decided to scope it out.

I called ahead and spoke to an Asian girl who seemed to have a good grasp of English and she texted me the address.

Rolled up to the side street which was very easy to get a good park and I was instructed to go to the back gate where I saw an Asian girl sitting on the porch who was to be my ML.

She was quite average looking but I was keen to see what services were offered here so I decided to TOFTT.

The parlour itself is very similar to 198 Whitehorse Rd, it is a very dodgy looking set up with old surroundings and gives off an AMP vibe once you walk inside.

I was led to the first room from the backyard which was just a simple bed with a towel draped over it in what appeared to be a room that hadn't been renovated in over 50 years with the door not able to be closed fully unless it is slammed shut.

The massage itself was quite poor and only lasted 10-15 mins before I was asked if I'd like a HJ, I enquired about other services and my ML told me that it was either a HJ ($30) or a topless HJ ($50).

The HJ itself was very mechanical and took me a good 10-15 mins before I finally came.

Tina was also very anal about time and it seemed apparent that she wanted me out of there in 20 mins or less.

She works at this AMP on Mondays and Tuesdays and says that there are 2 other girls on everyday.

WIR: Not for Tina, but yes to check out the other girls.

This is an interesting place. Bicycles sit on the porch, and a green piece of paper on the front door telling customers to enter through the back.  I met an attractive Asian girl mid to late 20;s who asked if I had rung before, and asked if I was peter.  I sounded confused and she asked for 50$. I asked to meet another girl. She walked away and I noticed a short dress under her black low cut top.  I then met  a green eyed girl, who looked between Asian and indian, with huge hips,passed then a not so attractive Asian women with slacks on.  I then reqested the first girl,and was told she was reception.   She was the sexiest and more provocatively dressed of the lot.  Weird place this for a house rnt

I popped in here today, unannounced, and the Asian receptionst asked me if i had booking, i said no, she said u must have booking here, i soon left, and headed into city. Im sure she remembered me from last time, and just didn't trust me after i walked.

members i popped in here after noticing an old regulars 4wd was not present behind the back of 435 canterbury rd, so i assumed she wasnt there, and for a 3rd time took a look here. Now the past 2 times ive been told no appointment no booking, but today i was greeted by grace, the asian women i did fs with a plastic bag a couple years ago at 29 high st glen iris. she recently ruined the rnt in mount waverley, just off the princess hwy, and today, she introduced a cuddly indian girl sitting on a exercise bike wearing tracksuit pants, and then offered herself.  I declined, and walked away knowing i dont need to worry about no appointments with these 2.

I don't mind taking one for the team, just looking for any intel that may not have already been posted  
When I'm in the mood for a good massage and less concerned about extras I'll venture on down here to save any potential disappointment as my general findings are that a lot of the Thai places are legit. Will report back when I do.

I actually prefer businesses that have official websites, but it's always on my mind if the photos on there are actually of the ladies that work there or just a general observation of the type of ladies that work there.

Always good to know which lady you might want before going there.

 Thai Hands from Heaven  17 Cookson Street, Camberwell - (03) 9882 7110

Person's Name : Selina ( Or something like that)

Establishment: Thai Hands from Heaven  17 Cookson Street, Camberwell  

Date of Visit: 23 July 2015
Contact Details/Address/Weblink:(03) 9882-7110
Hours of Business: 10am  9:00pm,
Rates: Varying but Relaxation $75.00 for the hour + $50
Age: early 20's
Size/shape: Nice body, what you could see, tight jeans, loose top with mid drift showing 
Nationality or Ethnicity: Thai
Services Provided: Okay Massage  Extras crap, 
Value for money/recommend? : Walked in off the street about 7:00pm on the way home from work. An older woman was at reception, asked what she would recommend she said a relaxation massage would be good, took the money and showed me to the room. The room was nice and large, well appointed, warm and had a nice wide massage table. 
Get undressed and wait and wait, eventually the receptionist comes in and says the girl won't be long and puts a towel over me. A short time after a young good looking girl with yellow bleached hair comes in and starts the massage, back 1st, arms, bum and legs, not a bad effort but have had better. At an opportune time during the massage I grab her leg and ran my hand up to her bum, she immediately moves away. Strike one. In the course of massage there was NO bum play or touching of the balls, I made it quite clear that I was up for it if she went there but alas no luck.

Came to the flip, she placed a towel over me so I could turn discretely; I then asked if there were extras, she said $50 for a HJ, there was no negotiation. Agreed, she jumps on the table between my legs, throws the towel off, covers me in oil and she is off like a thrashing machine, to my protests of slow down, but no she just got faster. Nothing like coming in a most unsatisfactory manner. At least she did a good job of cleaning me up properly.
Once this event was over she then massages my stomach in a circular motion for what seemed 10-15 minutes, finishing with a head massage.
I think the place has great potential, you just need to find the right ML, in the meantime will go back to 3 Sisters, at least you know what you are getting there!

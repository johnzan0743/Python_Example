Post Content: 
Person's Name : Simone

Establishment : Aloha Camberwell

Date of Visit : 24 Aug 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 1429a Toorak Rd, Camberwell, Vic

Hours of Business : 11 am to 10 pm

Rates : $100 ph.

Age : Mid 20s.

Size/shape : Slim with fake boobs.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Israeli.

Services Provided : R&T.

Value for money/recommend? : Maybe. 

My experience/comments : Simone says she has worked at other parlours under the name Sahara. Dark hair with very tan skin. Boobs are clearly fake.

Booked 60 mins. Back massage was very short - only lasted 15 mins. She then asked if I would like to roll over. Upon rolling over she immedietly asked if I wanted anything else. I asked what was on offer and she said nude and HJ. Opted for both for $70.

She stripped off fully. Nice body. Slim but not too slim.

HJ was OK. While it was slow her stroke was a bit hard and a bit uncomfortable. 

Simone was friendly but did seem a bit aloof.

Yes, she has always had attitude! $70 seems to be her 1st timers price then it magically goes up to $100 the next time you see her.

LOL. Go see her!

Hey Ruuguul - did she do the whole "I love my legs being touched" while she rubbed her pussy?

$70 nude HJ isn't too shabby, but you're already paying $100...whereas at Tokyo Milk it was $80 p/h + $100...so same difference...

I think she's good to experience once, maybe twice...but Sienna @ Tokyo Milk is waaaay better...

Value for money/recommend? : Yes Will return to see another girl as advised by owner he will fix me up with other not so expensive

My experience/comments : I have been on holiday for a week now and I hav 1week left so I thought I might see if I can find the best massage place that is not expensive and is local.

So from reading reviews sahara was my aim to find as other punter on this site help me locate her aloha massage retreat was my destination so I rang and made a book with Simone.

On the way there I get a phone call say Simone won't be in for an hour after the time i book so I drove around for a bit, anyway head up stair and the owner says she will be with u in a minute sitting waiting 1/2hr goes past she calls me in.

OMG she is a stunner I strip down and she starts packing on way to much oil she's asking me a million questions so the massage is sensual and she brushing against my member the she asked me to flip. There about 10mins to go she grabs my hand and puts it on her fantastic boob and says do u want extra which is her nude stoke the little fella and I can touch her where ever I want for extra $90 and I decline and tell her I wasn't going to pay extra $90 for not even 10mins. 
After I told her that it was like I wasn't even in the room so I just got up jump in the shower suited up and left the room and on the way out told the owner I wasn't happy with the stupid in room price for 10mins and that if I paid that at a brothel I would have the time of my life. He told me to book again and make sure I was taken care of next time.

I will return as I saw three hot chick in the back room as I was on the way out

Well there lies the problem. Asian girls don't do anything for me. Usually they are clinical. So once again, horses for courses. Is $70 a lot to pay for a nude HJ? you bet. Are there cheaper alternatives with white chicks? Not that I can find yet. 

If I want to just blow a load, there's plenty of cheap AMP around that caters for it. But I like white women, and there's a premium for them in this market...not saying what they charge is reasonable, just the way it is. What's the point of paying for a cheaper wank when the girl doing it doesn't rock my boat? To me its like jumping onto a review of Christine McQueen and saying how you can get a root at SCI for $155 p/hr...

I would consider $70 for a nude HJ good value these days. In the SE where I operate, you would be paying $50 for the 30 min massage plus another $50 for the nude HJ. I know of only one place in my area where you get a nude HJ for $70.

As for Asian girls, I can only conclude from you posts that you have only had limited experience with Asian girls. They are far more feminine than Caucasian girls, most are open to instructions, they are keen to please and perhaps best of all for me, their skin is like pure silk. I have never got splinters from a Chinese girl

Nah, I was referring to $70 EXTRA...yes $70 all inclusive is great value, but you won't ever find that with a white girl. Its simple supply vs demand - there's a lot more Asian AMP/ML's that offer extras and that's why they are cheaper...

I've been with plenty of Asian girls. I was generalizing when I said they were all clinical - yes, there are a few gems, but IMHO most of them offer a pretty standard experience. Also been with alot of white girls who are clinical too, but once again, I seem to have decent luck in finding ones that aren't. I've never gotten splinters from Caucasian  girls either 

anyway this is getting OT...I was just trying to point out that comparing the prices between white and asian rnt is a bit...pointless?

Hours of Business : 10am-10pm

Rates : 60mins $100 + extras

Age : 25..ish

Size/shape : 8 fake D cups

Nationality or Ethnicity : unsure

Services Provided : Massage and nude 

Value for money/recommend? : Expensive for what I got.... I might see another girl... but not simone.

My experience/comments :

Well here goes with my first review here.

AND.... that was bizarre.

I got in there and put the towel over my arse and when she came in she asked if she could remove it.  Of course i said YES.

Not knowing who i was getting when she came in, I looked up and was pleasantly surprised to see this smoking hot girl in the room.

The massage proceeded as I would expect in one of these places.... it was rubbish but relaxing. When she moved to the legs... she started to get up into the thighs and knew that we were on for a good one. Slowly ticklish strokes right up and close.

She gave me the all clear to touch above the clothes and whilst i did so... she kept on with the massage.

On the flip, she gave me the option: $90 Nude and full touching.  While expensive... (and doubting whether i should in my mind) i couldnt say no. I just love throwing money around! :S

Anyway.... we had some mutual touching that progressed to the point that I was basically giving her a massage. She seemed to really love it and wanted more.

She then said "that was great.... i could so cum right now. Do you mind if i jump up on the table?"  Not one to disappoint her.... i moved aside and up she jumped.

This is when it got weird.... As she went to town on her self (and seemingly knocking back my offer to assist) she told me to tickle her thighs.  I obliged and after a while she came and looked thoroughly happy with herself.  She then told me "the first time takes the longest.... i am going go again" and off she went.  This time she wanted me to suck her nipples.

So... after the second time she came, I got excited because it was going to be my turn. I jumped back on the table and then she just said "ok... the shower is over there..."

Obviously i laid there with a hard on and a dissapointed look on my face.... she told me "i dont do relief!!!"

BULLLSHITTTTTTTTT FUCK...... I assume it was because i am a fat bastard and she didnt want to touch my cock.

Anyway.... i had my shower and got out of there quicksmart.

Would I return??? MAYBE... But DEFINITELY NOT TO SEE SIMONE.

bizarre.

Not cool. Sorry to hear that Yankee  
Maybe some one needs to teach her a lesson. 

3 ideas : 
* cum on her face 
* get dressed and walk out when she undresses (do her self esteem in) 
* don't discuss extras & price and just go with the flow, then after the deed is done get dressed and throw her a $20, Tell her that's all she is worth and leave like a boss! 

If I wasn't so protective about my identity and privacy, I would definitely do the last one.

There are words in this thread that sound like threats.

Threats are against the rules.

What Yankee has reported is provoking and upsetting but it is not an excuse for heated remarks.

The forum exists to inform members about good and un-good providers.

The good get more business and the un-good get less or none.

Once Simone/Sahara realises her income is dropping or that she's got a name for bad service among her employers, she will either leave the industry or smarten up.

Let's leave it there please.

The most effective way of dealing with this situation is for her customers to write accurate reports of their experiences. If they are fair but mostly negative, prospective customers who read those reports will get the message load and clear.

If it's the same one that was at tokyo milk then she has a smoking hot body and even though I normally like implants, hers are the exceptions that make the rule.  There is no doubting that she is in it for the $$$ though and makes no secret of it.

Person's Name : Simone

Establishment : Aloha Massage Retreat

Date of Visit : 3 October 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : aloha massage retreat and spa melbourne

Hours of Business : 11 am to 10 pm

Rates : $100 ph + $90

Age : Mid 20s.

Size/shape : Slim athletic body, enhanced bust

Nationality or Ethnicity : Italian/Israeli

Services Provided : R&T.

Value for money/recommend? : Yeah, maybe once. YMMV.

My experience/comments : 

So I ended up going to this place after reading about Simone / Sahara on here. The location is great, very legit looking. They seem sell various skin creams etc, and when I got there there was even a guy there that seemed to be making some kind of corporate booking?

One slightly odd thing though is that they make you lie straight onto the massage bed without any towels. At the end though she did spray and wipe it down with something though maybe this is more normal at a 'legit' or high end place?

Anyway, once I met Simone I wasn't disappointed though she was a little cautious with me to begin with. Once I was satisfied that she was comfortable with me I asked about extras (she did ask earlier if I had been before) and she offered the $90 nude + tug option which I took her up on.

Her massage is ok but not great, it is more of the 'sensual' variety. I was just enjoying it when she invited me to touch her as she said it's more enjoyable for her this way, lol. Of course I took her up on this offer and could feel what an awesome bod she had (she had nuded up after I had already laid down so I hadn't seen her properly yet).

The massage proceeded like this for a while until she placed herself at the head of the table and massaged my lower back while her breasts rubbed against my back. I finally got the 'reveal' at this point as I looked up and there she was in all her glory. Boys she is a stunner, awesome enhanced boobs and great curvy waist with gold chain thingy on her naval. 

On the flip I was able to lick and kiss her awesome nipples as she provided the tug. 

All in all this was a great albeit expensive experience. It did seem like it could go either way to begin with so tread carefully guys.

Sounds like your experience was pretty decent. $190 for the hour is a bit steep, but still cheaper than Bodyline.

Any issues with her cleanliness/smell?

Just checked the location for this place, calling it Camberwell is a bit of a stretch I think. Hartwell/Burwood maybe?

Curiosity got the better of me so I went for a visit.  Lauren does an excellent massage and plenty of incidental touching but was firmly no dice for extras.  I got the feeling there might be more on offer for regulars but she wasn't going there today unfortunately.  I have to say the room is excellent - super clean with a near new shower in the corner.  Lots of fresh towels around that looked near new.

Went back yesterday to see what I could see and once again enjoyed a fantastic massage from Lauren.  More touching and rubbing the appropriate areas and she did the whole thing in just a G string.  Although there was heaps of incidental touching etc it was an emphatic no to the hj but she was fine with diy. Tbh I didn't mind finishing myself.  WIR???

 After reading the review on quiny back in jan I popped in around feb and was told she was on holiday in china. I forgot about her, then popped in a couple weeks back, and was told she was on holiday again. Popped in yest and she was there. Had to book her after the awesome review I read.

 To the member who told me to stop telling members what the girls are wearing, and then told me to go out an do some reviews, I hope this and the 4 others is satisfying you. 

 The male boss,-jim, looks like the new ron moss in the bold and the beautiful, but when I chatted to him at reception, while watching him count a wad of 50 and 20 dollar notes, I couldn't help but notice his black jacket was filthy and full of white stains. When he stepped behind the counter he had jeans on and no shoes and socks. He told me the minimum time booking I could do was 45 mins which would cost 90$. No eftpos, had to go to cba to get extra.

 45 mins wait for quiny, saw 2 aussie chicks having a smoke, all the girls were wearing leg ins. The 2 aussies were dark haired girls, both looked like promotional models. When this bloke put me in the first room, I layed on a slippery black massage table, which seems to be a rubbery substance and im sure im lying in another customers oil. The lights were off and the room had nice music and a blue look about it. "the therapist will be in soon I was told". 15 mins later that is lol.

 Quiny turned on the light when she entered. Slim women, didn't look overly chinese, in fact she looked a little like demi moore. Black shiny leggings, a tattoo on her back between bra sports top and pants. Professional massage oil used, and a wishy washy massage style.. After 5 mins on back she started on legs, and then I asked about extras. She told me she couldn't touch "that", and would not be able to take clothes off. Extra to sit on table and do sensual massage lol. Declined. This girl was no tease, looked anxious and was 99% off her body of work from the January review. 

 Maybe this place has been warned as of late about extras or something. Things got worse im afraid. I cut the massage short by 15 mins. Quiny said I will get a hot towel. She came back with a towel dipped in cold water, wiped about 6 times all over body, then I used a towel to try to get the oil off. I requested a shower and she said "broken". Had to laugh the guys counting about 5000$ in his hand at reception, and there too tight to allow a shower because of the cost.

 She wiped the massage table with a rag, so my bodily oils will be waiting for the next customer to lie in, yuk. 

 I just had to try this joke of a place, and I certainly wont be back. 90$ for 45 mins is a disgraceful amount to take from customers at this shop. If u are having a bad run at rnt's go and top off your disappointment by being royally ripped off by this place.

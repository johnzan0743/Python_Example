My experience/comments : Had a sore shoulder so popped into Salah Thai for a massage. Although a more legit massage place, I have on occasion been rewarded with a tug and this time was no exception. Nothing further on offer though. WIR? Yes, if i have a sore shoulder again 

Believe it or not she didnt ask for extra payment! I did tip her $20 though. The HJ was on the whole well done, if a little fast. I think as its a more legit place, there was no fake moaning or anything like that.

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : I don't think so

My experience/comments : Saw the review here and thought I'd book. I had a massage there about five years ago and had the shittest massage ever. But to be honest, I was not looking for a RnT, but thought I was booking a genuine thai massage and was surprised when the lady undressed me completely and I was trying so hard not to get a hard on. Looking back now, maybe I should have twigged. Anyway, I got a refund because it truly was an hour of the shittest massage ever.

So, now that I was armed with the above info, I made a booking for an hour, but requested a lady who knew how to massage well. I think the receptionist was a bit wary, because he showed me to my room and told me to undress but leave the underwear on. The lady came in, draped me with a towel and proceeded to get straight into a basic form of thai massage from feet to neck. She then went to what I can only describe as firm effleurage, but obviously not trained in any way, painful and annoying at times and mildy relaxing and pleasant at others. After about twenty minutes, I told her that the last time I had a massage here, that the lady took my underwear off and asked if she was comfortable if I was nude. She said that it would be alright with her.

So, the massage proceeded, still draped though, and turn over occured. When there was ten minutes to go, I asked her if she was going to do the WHOLE body and she said yes. She was just finishing up with the scalp when I asked her if she massaged down there. She asked if I needed that and I said yes. She said no. I offered her an extra $20 and she smiled and shook her head. After a minute I offered $40 and she nodded. After applying lots of oil she proceeded to massage my boy and she was really good, probably the second best tug I've had. Her technique was exquisite, which made me wonder why her massage skills were so average and she must be more practised in the art of tug. I came, she cleaned up the asked me to sit up and massaged my shoulders. I gave her $40 and she bowed and said thankyou and left the room. So all up $120 for 60 mins of average massage but really good tug, but I thought for that I could have had 30 mins of unbridled romping elsewhere instead.

Age : early to mid 20s

Size/shape : Perfect - maybe 8

Services Provided : Massage only

Value for money/recommend? : Absolutely for the massage only

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)  As this was the first time I left my jocks on.

In came Penny, not that talkative because of the language barrier.  She gave one of the best massages all over.  She half pulled my jocks down when doing the back.  Then when doing my legs lifted my jocks up & put the towel under.  She went tight into my crutch but no tickle.

It was getting me going at stages.

Fantastic head massage at the end.  Not sure of any extras, maybe different if with one of the older women.

Definitely worth it for the massage.

Rates : $75/h + $50 HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :

Box Hill's long running Salah Thai has upgraded with recent relocation. 
Shirley is fit young Thai girl with good Thai massage skills. I wasn't sure if extras on offer at the beginning but shortly realised it is when she start pumping my jimmy for fun 

Her HJ was long enough and good. She certainly knew how to make guys turns on so I wasn't really in negotiation mood when she asked for $50. - bit too chatty tho.

I think there's high chance knight of whitehorse will pay a visit to the business sooner or later given the location, so now is time to spend all your insurance money. 

MOD: I took out phone number from title for obvious reason but feel free to put it back if you like.

I used to go to this shop when I lived in the area. Wasn't aware it had moved. Was definitely better than their Bourke Road shop

Mixed experience for me and there were often mature ladies working. Found it a bit weird they used to have a long row of showers at the back of the shop. 
 There used to be some great girls working here but I often couldn't get the same one twice. Did you see any other younger girls working?

Yes, there were at least couple of young ML I can see and AFAIK Pim the mature ML you mentioned is the owner of the shop but she seems retired? 
Still can see her massage accreditation on the wall tho. 
Young Thai guy was at reception instead and since the music is coming from his iPhone, it was constantly mixing up with his SMS tones.

My experience/comments :

The joint is still up and running with quality massures. Amy works weekend+Monday and certainly do know the game + good firm Thai massage skill.

I especially liked that she constantly stand where my hands can have some free roam around her hot box during entire session.

It seemed like there might be more on offer if you become regular but didn't bother to ask.

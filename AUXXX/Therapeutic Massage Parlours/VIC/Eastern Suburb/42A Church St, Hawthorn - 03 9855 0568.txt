Went here after a no show at Grove Rd. Upstairs chinese massage shop which appears legit. 
Had Milky, 20's Asian size 10 pretty girl. Warm room paid $45 for 30mins. Got a very good firm massage
with tickles around butt and balls. On the turn over she gave a long ball massage and all over the groin but wouldnt HJ. So i relieved myself whilst she did a lot of ball fiddling. Not sure if I'd return it was a great sensual massage but ok for a once off only.

Services: Massage & DIY

Value for money/recommend?: Not really

My experience/comments:  Thought I would give Milky a try -  No towel was used to cover up good sign. As per PB's experience massage was firm quite good.  I stated I would like soft around the halfway mark.  Not much change in pressure so had to try and give directions as time ticked away.  Throughtout the massage there was enough occassional ball brushes for me too think the green light was there.  Managed to get a nice tickle type massage going. Asked the question and got a polite no just std massage.  I asked to turnover more but nothing was doing.  As I didnt want to leave with blueballs she stated I could DIY.  Better than nothing but wont be back, mainly due to the lack of effort from her from start to finish.

Value for money/recommend? : Definitely.

My experience/comments: She gives a very good firm massage. Plenty of balls stroking from the rear and running her fingers along your crack and kneading of the ass. Then the flip and she gives you the best 'balls massage'. Within a matter of seconds you be will rock hard and dripping with pre-cum while she massages the base of your cock. This balls massage goes on for about 10 minutes and then she will invite you to finish off. She says she is not allowed to stroke your cock! Doesn't matter. It's a very erotic and sensual experience.

I went there after PB's review (maybe late July) and she had been well and truly spooked by the amount of new customers she was receiving who had mentioned hearing about her on the net.She thought everyone was a cop and wouldn't go near the cock as a result.

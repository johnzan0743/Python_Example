My experience/comments :

Recently open, very clean looking, looks a bit more like a day spa (almost put me off). Been there a couple of times and always met by asian (PRC I think) ladies in there mid to late 30's. All seem to have slim but firm bodies, probably no stranger to hard work.

Massage skills have been excellent and they seem to find the spots that need a little tension release. Of the three visits only once did I not get extras. On all occasions they the assured me it wasn't that sort of a place but when they could see I was "interested" two of them asked me to be very quiet and gave me the nod. They didn't have the usual music playing so it is possible it isn't a regular service.

One of them had the interesting touch of taking my hand and placing it on her breast and encouraging me to give them a squeeze in an effort to speed things up - it worked. 

Needless to say when they finally accepted their role in the charade they provided an enthusiastic and skilful service. I prompted both girls to get adventurous with their finger but only one obliged. 

They paid good attention to details and made an effort to pretend it was a real pleasure. They cleaned up nicely and left me well satisfied.

Saw Jessie today. Slim and attractive PRC lady in her mid 40's with A cups. Was wearing a very sexy and small pick and purple PVC outfit and sporting a very fasionable (not often seen on Chinese women) haircut. Absolutely fantastic massage, like a lomi lomi, less oil but still with all the long and under body strokes. Liked the way she straddled my head when she was working my shoulders and dropped her thigh between my legs and against my nuts when she worked my bum and thighs. Lots of crack work and not so accidental passes across the boys including thumb pressing deep into the groin.. On the flip I let things go to see if an offer was made. Massage was so good I was happy to go without the tug to see if she would initiate any extras. No offers made but when I booked again for Friday for a longer session she was delighted and kissed me on the cheek to say thank you. I am guessing my patience and the built rapport will be returned in spades on Friday. Will let you all know.

Visited yesterday and enjoyed an even better massage. Jesse was held up in another booking so the second Mature Asian lady started the massage for her. Very funny! 30 seconds on the back and straight into a deep and oily crack massage. then Jesse took over from her. Just the right amount of pressure and oil and more sensual touch than the previous massage. I'd say as good as Flo's Balinese massage (Doncaster and Blackburn) and I think that's saying something. Enjoyed it so much I didn't bother to ask for the tug but I genuinely think she was up for it. Call me stupid but on rare occasions the whole experience is more enjoyable as a legit massage and this was one of those times for me.

Drove past the other day and noticed business name change. No longer blue signage with Cloud Care Therapy. Instead red signage - Ashburton Relaxation Therapy.

a massage shop being replaced by another massage shop, seems to be a real demand for this industry.

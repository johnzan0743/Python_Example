A new Thai Massage Shop opened up at 536 Whitehorse Rd Surrey Hills. 
The details from the flyer are:

Mon-Fri 10am-9pm

Ph 90772288

Nice looking Thai girl working as I walked passed. Has any one got any feedback from this joint? Might have to go and have a punt and will get back to you.

Brochure prices were 60min/$60 for a full body Thai massage. Lots of talk in the brochure of relaxation and stress relief with friendly staff so who knows?!!!

Cheers, CR

60/60 normally implies pyjamas for the guy and full Thai dress for the masseur.  Best of luck when you TOFTT matey.

Took one for the team today!

Saw Jaa (pronounced Jar) nice girl, mid 20's but largish. $55/45mins. Strictly legit. 

Massage was actually very nice, but avoided bumping junior by a country mile. Use of towel to cover me up during entire massage. :-(

Nice premises with big massage rooms, heated tables and clean.

Talked to Kitty (the owner) afterwards who said business is slow so I wonder if extras may be offered later to get return customers!?

Complimentary fruit plate and cup of tea afterwards- very nice.

Great place for legit massage.

given the location of the place (off a very very busy and prominent main road in a fairly posh residential suburb), I very much doubt any non-legit action will be available here.

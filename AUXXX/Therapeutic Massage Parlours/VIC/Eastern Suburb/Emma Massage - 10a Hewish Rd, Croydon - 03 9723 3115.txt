As I was in the area, I dropped in yesterday. The place has 3 massage cubicles with curtains, so it is not very discrete, and hinted of straight massage only. I gave it a go.

I was greeted by Candy, who took my $50 for 45 minutes. I must say that her massage was quite good. She kept well away from the privates. On the flip, she placed a towel over my privates. Her massage went from hard (which I asked for) to more sensual over my stomach and chest. She avoided touching my nipples. She massaged my legs in similar manner, then back to my stomach and chest. Then, 5 minutes before the finish time, she announced that she had finished. Another customer had booked her, and rather than make a fuss, I just let that go.

WIR? Only if I was in the area again, and wanted a straight massage at that time. To be fair, her massage was good and enjoyable, and she was a friendly person.

I've been here twice in Jan, i've had Emma who is a 40-ish Asian lady and owner and one her girls. On both occasions they provided a good sensual style but so far it's definitely been a DIY experience. To tell you the truth I haven't asked for anything more, just had the feeling that nothing else would be on offer.

Good massage though

My experience/comments :

Booked in for a 30min Lomi Lomi for $50. Was running a bit late, so I called up and the lady on the phone said she had no bookings after mine, which was handy. Got there and got introduced to Emily who was a bit overweight. The massage was pretty average, as yankee said it wasn't a true Lomi Lomi massage. But overall is it was alright. Flipped and I was already hard, I hadnt released in a few days. She motioned for HJ and said $20. HJ was pretty good but I've had better. A lot of oil and she was a bit rough but overall solid.

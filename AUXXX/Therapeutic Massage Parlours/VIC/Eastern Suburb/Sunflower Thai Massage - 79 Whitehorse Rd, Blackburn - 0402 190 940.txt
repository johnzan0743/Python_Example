After driving up whitehorse road the other day I happened to see the sign for SunFlower Thai. Since I had not seen anything about this place I thought I would TOFTT. I pulled up around lunchtime and went to the front door that had a HUGE sign say NO SEXUAL services. I knocked on the door and was greeted by a friendly lady with a four year old. I said I was after a massage and she said that it was not for sexual sevices. I figured now that I was there I might as well have the massage. 

I was lead to the first room which had a mattress on the floor and when I was in there I was told to take my clothes off but leave my underwear on. I said thata I prefered to be naked but was told to leave them on. I lied down on the floor and when she came back into the room she started to proceed to give me a very nice massage. I was covered in towels expect for the parts that were being massaged at all times and it was all strictly above board. If you are after a good massage with NO extras then I would go to this place

Kiwi was her name Pim? If the massage was genuine and good, would like to try. Looks like she works from home now. Is she good looking?

I decided to pop into the thai massage by coles in Mitcham and taken to one of the rooms in the back of the place. I was soon joined by Lisa who was very quietly spoken. She proceeded to give me a great massage and worked out all my aches and pains that I had. Every so often there was a slight touch between the legs which was feeling good. She got me to turn over and started to tease me saying how beautiful I was while running her hands over the old fella. She put her hand up and showed five fingers and was thinking that $5 was to good to be true and said yes. She gave me a great HJ and finished up the massage and I was feeling nice and relaxed. I gave her $20 as I thought was fairer and she said no no as when she was holding up 5 fingers she meant $50 lol. oooooops I guess she needs to learn a little bit more english.

"crossed wires" in the review as well. Was it Lisa or Milky?

So did you end up giving her $20 or $50?

My experience/comments : 

After my post a couple of months back when i found the mobile number of this shop matched another http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f286/b...6-976-a-24103/  I decided to go check it out.

Shop was very large and couple of massage chairs in front and full rooms in back. Get lead into room by girl on reception noticed older lady sitting in a chair. 

Anyway once in room, table was very different to what i normally use to, big timber table with beams going up sides and over head hand rail. Ann walked into room we exchanged names and ask for mid to firm massage, Towel was placed over back.

Massage was very very good, thou sometimes the pressure points might have been little hard so maybe i should have just ask for medium.  During massage she up and down on the table, lots of stretching too sitting on you. On flip she put towel back on and was forever tucking bits back in, she was a very friendly and nice girl to talk too

i did try and put my hand on her arse, but not too much love, just ask if i was ok had bit of giggle and placed my hand back on table. 

WIR, if in area and need a good massage yes, would see her again, but would more be once off than something regular, for massage would rather save myself 20$ and go see another Ann.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : A regular ML worked here for a couple of months. Called and she was not there, gone back to Thailand. Booked an hour anyhow for 10:30am on a Saturday morning. Got there a bit early and there was a Thai woman with red tights vacuuming the carpet and the older mamasan was floating around. Into the room, one without the posts on the corners hoping that it wasn't going to be the vacuum lady, but it was. Oh well, enjoy the massage. And, the massage was outstanding and the teasing. It was the best ever. Lots of inner thigh, sack, crack. Outstanding. And, still lying on my front, one hand around underneath holding me and the other hand working the sack and the crack. Changed sides and more again. She had me on the edge what seemed like 20 minutes. When I couldn't bear it any longer I turned over and she finished me off with great technique. My erection wouldn't go down it was so great so went into the shower and had to have another go myself. Tipped $50. Despite not being from a young hottie, and there was no desire for return touching, it was an outstanding massage. I went back a few weeks later and got someone younger and more attractive (girl with lazy eye) but she had a bad attitude and wanted $100 extra for clothed HJ, ah pass.

Person's Name : Sal

Establishment : Total Wellness

Date of Visit : Nov 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : http://totalwellnessthaimassagespa.myob.net/

Hours of Business : 10am -8pm

Rates : $60/1/2 hr

Age : late 20's or early 30's

Size/shape : Medium

Nationality or Ethnicity : Unsure but not Thai - could be mixed

Services Provided : Massage only

Value for money/recommend? : Maybe - even for a great massage

My experience/comments : Drove past this and based on some reviews by others thought I'd give it a go. I was a bit disappointed with the last at the front desk - fair old Thai lady and not attractive. i was about to walk when Sal came through and said "I'll take this one". She looked maybe a bit of a mixed race but certainly not Thai. I thought I'd give her a chance and went the 1/2 hr option. I was ushered through to a very clean and presentable room. There were railings for back walking but i wasn't going there. She gave me instructions on lying face down and put the sheet over you. I usually like to test the waters by going fully nude so I was a bit thwarted by that instruction. Did as I was told and a really good massage commenced. The oil had some liniment in it so it was warming and Sal did an excellent slow and firm massage that hit all the right spots. The did a lot of work on my back and as the time ticked on, I asked if this was going to be a back massage only. She said no and then commenced on the legs by folding the sheet down one leg and butt cheek so as to preserve my dignity - damm it. Time ran out and I got the warm towel down. When I had finished she said i should come back for an hour massage next time as we could do a lot more. The way she said it was very sexy and suggestive. Now she may be a great saleswoman or there could be more on the cards next time. At the counter on the way out I flirted just a little so I'm looking forward to the next visit to see what transpires. Sal works Mondays and Wednesdays. They close at 8 but you can book a little later. I might try and get a late appointment next time!

My experience/comments : Was going to be in the area and thought Slotho's review had signs of potential. Shop front very new and shiny. Clinical, soulless. Had booked in advance and after sorting the financials need to use the toilet and was shown out the back where two other ML's were cooking their lunch in a garage type space. Attractiveness level of the three girls I had seen was very low. Not a good sign. Massage rooms are open above and it is very easy to hear what's going on in the other rooms. I think there are four standard rooms and one mat on floor type room. I'd seen another punter go in a few minutes before me and he was in the room directly opposite. The Bulldozer must weight about 90-100kg and I wasn't looking forward to the ninja moves. Survived those, but then the elbow action into the back was killer with spasm of pain. I'd asked for medium. Boxers had been left on and were being smeared with oil. No tease or tickle and nothing enjoyable at all. Flip at 40 min mark. Let it go a bit on the legs but then called it time about 10 minutes early. I sat up and said that's enough. By her indignant reaction I think she thought I had asked for extras! I doubt this ML has ever been asked for extras. This place is neither an authentic Thai massage place or a RnT.

Nationality or Ethnicity: Indian

Services Provided: Great Massage, and that's all

Value for money/recommend?:  Sunday afternoon and not much happening decided to try this place as I had seen many times on the way home with the characteristic light flashing "Ã–pen".

Walked in the Thai receptionist is on the phone, (nice body great tits, and a little older) but am shown to the 1st room that was in past life a glass fronted office, but now has a massage table, couch and curtains in front of the glass partitions, there is an Indian girl dozing on the couch, who turned out to be Ruby my ML. The room is comfortably warm. Note the curtains do not cover the windows completely so anyone passing can see exactly what is happening in the room.

Was asked to undress and lie face down on the table, Ruby comes in and immediately covered me with a towel and commences and very competent massage. After the 1st leg is completed you know there is going to be NO extras with this massage. The massage continues with a high quality warm oil. As stated Ruby is competent and gives a good massage. She is relatively talkative and a student. Once the massage is complete Ruby does a wipe down with warm towels.

On the way out the lady at the desk said "come back" we will have new girls shortly, will give it one more go with the new girls, maybe the luck and service will change.

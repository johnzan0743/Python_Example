Posted this review in another forum earlier today:

Fair dinkum, I need to see a psychiatrist.

I was out and about the other day but, as usual, only had a little time  to spare. Determined to make the most of it (I mean, why spend half an  hour browsing in a book shop when there's a chance I can get a winsome  maiden to handle my cock?) I decided to check into this RnT venue I'd  sussed out some time ago but had never tried, conveniently located in  the suburb which work commitments had forced me to visit. This place  always seemed very quiet whenever I passed by but, what the fuck, let's  give it a burl.

Door opens to reveal a reasonable looking Chinese chick, probably around  30 years of age, quite tall, not fat but not thin so medium to curvy in  build and quite OK to look at.

In the room she is very confident. Speaks English well and seems, um,  not sure how to describe it but maybe 'street-wise'. She doesn't seem to  be an out and out skank but I'd say her legs have been opened on many  previous occasions and she now knows very well how to put this to good  use to keep butter on the table and petrol in the BMW. She sort of  struts confidently around the room, with a quick and a smart answer to  all my questions. No coyness but in a friendly manner.

Jeez I'm a dickhead. Sometimes when I'm in these situations I like to  have a bit of fun, play a few mind-games. I pretend I'm a different  person with a completely different personality to the one I actually  have (which is pretty crap anyway so no loss). WTF, I probably won't see  this woman often again and she doesn't know me from a bar of soap  anyway. So, on a whim, seeing as she's playing the confident, very  experienced sex-worker and worldly courtesan, I let on that I'm a meek,  mild, quietly spoken guy, very inexperienced in the ways of women (I've  probably fucked more women than she's eaten Chicken Fried Rice dinners  but I don't want to stand on ceremony). 

So she strips off and I'm face down on the table. She starts the  massage; light strokes up and down my back with occasional tickles of my  sac. Pretty boring. I like the tension and anticipation to build up a  bit before they go for my tackle but WTF. There's a mirror on the wall  which I can look straight into while she's massaging me and I notice  she's checking herself out in it as she works away on me. Bloody hell,  she's more interested in herself than in the massage. OK, two can play  this game. So I start pretending that the massage is really turning me  on. I start moaning heavily whenever she brushes my balls and bring my  head up and look admiringly at her in the mirror. Shit, Marlon Brando  had nothing on me as an actor. I reckon I should get an Oscar for this  performance. "Wow, you've got nice breasts", I moan (actually, no lie,  they were very nice). "Do you like me?" she asks. "Do you think I'm  beautiful?"  Fuck'n hell, she's as nutty as I am! "Oh, yeh", I moan  loudly, "you're very beautiful". I reach around and stroke her thighs.

Next I hear myself telling her that I'm about to get married and I need  someone to show me how to make a woman come. Fuck, where did I get that  idea from? Maybe I've got multiple personalities and it's the other guy  talking. In any case, at school I was top of the class in Biology. I  know the anatomy of a vagina like the back of my hand. But WTF, this  fiction I'm building is gotta be good for a laugh eventually. I start  kidding her to show me her pussy, close-up, and give me a lesson in  female 'orgasm-ology'. She just laughs at first and says "Maybe" and  then, after my repeated pleadings, "Maybe, next time". But suddenly,  fuck'n hell, she walks to the front of the massage table, beside the  mirror and sits her arse up on the pillow with her legs up against the  wall, opened, one either side of the mirror. "OK", she says, "let me  show you". By this stage I'm up and standing beside her, checking out  the action. She's straddled so that, looking into the mirror, you get an  eye full of her pussy. Small labia so it's all open to view. She looks a  bit like she's about to give birth, legs up in stirrups. "Oh," she  says, "I get really horny when I look at my pussy". You and me both,  sister. She gets me to start massaging her clit,authoritativelypointing  its location out to me like she's my old VCE Biology teacher (he never  showed me his clit) and, while I'm eagerly following her directions  (like the attentive student I am) she starts tugging my length. I could  feel her getting wet so I ask her if she is gonna come. "How do I tell  if a woman has come?", I ask. "In a minute ... ah,  just wait, ohh", she  replies and then, moments later, moans and shudders slightly. By this  stage, with her all the while still grappling with my cock, I can't hold  back anymore and I spurt all over her leg. She stands to clean up and I  notice that the pillow she's been sitting on has been graced with a big  wet patch of her come (that's a bonus for the next punter after me).

"Gee", I say, "that was great!" (actually, it wasn't bad ... I didn't  get a fantastic RnT experience but the play-acting had been a giggle and  the pussy play was alright ... what a pathetic bastard I am).

As I'm dressing she's eager for return customers (that's fine, it's a  business) so she tempts me by indicating that next time I might like a  lesson in dildo-ology ... and maybe more. Should I bring an apple for  the teacher?

Walking back to my car I pause for a moment, enter a calm space, and  become my usual self again.

The title of the post "Where Warrigals Canter" should give punters a good clue as to the location of this place, close to the intersection of 2 main roads in an eastern suburb.

I'm not giving out any more info. The general consensus in another forum is that, given that RnT venues are currently being raided and closed down on a daily / weekly basis, punters should be wary of giving out too much info.

I think that's sensible.

Can someone please explain the logic in this.

Punter A visits a place and writes a review but makes the location so cryptic that only his fellow punters can work it out. But not the council stooges,police or any other gubbermint agency.

Seriously?

A review without contact details is useless and of no use to anyone.. Members are not mind readers nor look for landmarks..

So true. However... it was a good read! Pity it's no use to us Sydney-ites... mind you, for the potential fun I'd have a crack at the code!!!

Great review Salsa very amusing. Cracking the codes is all part of the fun here in Melbourne and we need to keep these places in business. I have no idea where this is but know it's not in my part of town.

Salsa: please confirm via pm whether the suburb is Surrey Hills.

Hi SOO, surrey hills melbourne would seem to be right on the punting money. Why the secrecy of the location from the southerners. Obviously Mexicans have something to hide????.  IMHO think a person who doesn't give accurate location/contact details is as the English say "a bit of a tosser".

I can certainly understand the concerns of our Victorian cousins, but as another member has already suggested, the local council/police officers would be able to "crack the code" in about 5 seconds flat. After all, they know these areas better than anyone.

G'day.   I thought I had cracked this code and went to the two main streets I thought we were talking about, but alas nothing found.   How far from this intersection is this place?   I walked a few 100m to the East, the South and West of it but saw nothing.   Can I confirm there is a car dealership right on the intersection we are talking about??

If the answer is NO, then obviously I am no Robert Langdon aka the DaVinci code cracker!!!!!

I have been to this place a few times in the last 
5 years. It's been going awhile so the owner obviously
knows who to keep happy. But it's all about to change.
The councils are no longer responsible for policing unlicensed
brothels in Victoria. The police are getting that responsibility
they have all the intel so look out for a concerted publicized
raiding of multiple premises in the coming months. I myself
am lying low for the meanwhile, he'll, I may have to start
going to legit places.

My experience/comments : With lots of spare time I decided to give this place a go. I've been waiting for a few months after a previous review of this place titled "Where Warrigal Canters" appeared on this site. In short it was OK but on the borderline of the weird. After calling saying that I'm on the way, arrived at this corner house in Canterbury Road. Noticed all the windows with the venetian blinds down. After knocking on the door twice, a small smiling lady on a floral dress opened the door. Would you mind waiting 15 min? she said. I thought I just called to check she was available (?). Never mind. Can I wait here? - I said. It's up to you. Waited for her in her lounge room. More than 15min passed and heard the noises of someone else leaving the house and saying goodbye. Immediately after she opened the lounge door and invited me to the massage room opposite. Big smile, high pitch voice, and jumping rather than walking.  Wow lots of energy, she must be on something. $50 half-hour, $70 nude, she said. Nude please. Gave her the money and she left the room. I pulled my gear off and laid up on the massage table. Not bad setup, at least it's clean. She appeared again and in a flash she took her dress. As I noticed when she first opened the door, there was nothing underneath and she was completely naked. Hmmm! a bit of show nut. Nice body for her age. That was just the beginning of her performance. She offered me HJ and BJ. BJ was $20 extra, and parted with it. She disappeared again and came back in a run, still naked. What followed was 20-25 min of a well rehearsed sequence.  She pretty much went straight into it. CBJ it was and there was plenty of mutual light touches. Pussy felt weird, like she put some kind of gel to appear wet (?). Small and very fluffy pussy, same feeling about the boobs. When asked for 69 she jumped on the table I was able to taste the gel (?) There were some pulling out moves, too many to make it enjoyable. It took a while for her to relax and laid on my tummy. Feeling her body was great and she kept at the BJ all this time. Eventually I came despite the fake noises she was making, again all part of the show. She cleaned me up and continue with a soft massage. There was little talk and the topic was how good she looked for a 45-yo (?) with a nice pussy and nice set of boobs. Not sure I need to hear self-advertising, but she had to make the pitch to ensure a return. Also there was mention of another girl. Don't they always mention the other one? Another weird thing, she kept checking at herself in a mirror behind the table, pretty much all the time. Beautiful girls like mirrors, she said (?) Time was up and as I walked out with a good bye kiss I check the time, 29min since the lounge door open. WIR, not sure, once is enough for me. Happy punting.

This lady has been around for some time, I first saw her in Balwyn about 4 years ago. She is very enthusiastic and loves some mutual rubbing, I don't even bother with any massage now, just straight to the good stuff. Weird thing is that she is constantly checking herself out in the mirror and asking if she is good looking! I reply in the affirmative and proceed to keep her quiet with something of my own!!! Good experience, good price and you know what you will be in for so she remains on my list

I hadnt seen Mimi before, so I rang and made an appointment, booked in, but she seemed a little bit unsure of everything.  But anyway I ventured out to her place, knocked right on time, she ushers me in, she's got a tight little body, we negotiate an hr, then she tells me she has another client.  I figure I've come all that way, I can wait, so she says strip down and lie on the table and she'll be back.  Well, she did come back........... probably 20 mins later, I was dozing on and off, so I probably wasnt too upset by it.

She comes in, strips down, fantastic body indeed for someone her age.  Her face isnt pretty, but its ok.  So she begins her massage and its pretty firm and thats good and no mucking about, she's in between the legs and playing with the boys, so my hands are exploring away, and she is letting me feel how wet she is, but no finger insertion, thats cool, I got to play with the cat and rub her clit, as tiny as it is.  I ask her if I can eat her and she climbs on top and gives me full access, yeah I can handle this while she gobbles down on me. Still trying to find that clit, I'm sure I did, but its not normal size!

Eventually, she climbs down and brings me to a damn strong orgasm with her hands.  I'm left there contemplating life as she runs off to wash and I knew she'd want to come back in and do something ridiculous like rub my bloody head and I wasnt there for that.  So before she came in, I got up, got dressed and when she returned I left.  She said more next time, I'm thinking how much more....

But yeah, worth a visit.

[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments :
Rocked up to this place and found parking very easy and the house isn't too far from the side street so was very easy to get in and out. I had to wait for a good 10 mins in the lounge room while she was finishing with another customer, Cindy then comes out and asks straight up if I want nude and she tells me $75 for nude and $50 for non-nude, thinking back I probably should have gone with the $50 option but I probably would have got charged the same amount all up anyway. The nudity ended up being pretty pointless she didn't do any body slides or really show off her body at all during the back massage.

The massage itself was just general moving of hands with the occasional ball tickle which was very pleasant, this only lasted about 10-15 mins before I got flipped and Cindy transitions into an unspoken HJ which I assumed would be inclusive of the $75, I wanted oral though so I just asked before she started to get to work with the HJ.

Oral ended up costing another $20 which included DATY, so I started by licking her pussy for a few seconds before a knock on the door came and she went to answer it, then coming back I sucked on her tits which are a decent 32C, nothing amazing though. I then went on to her pussy but she told me no fingers because she is "too sensitive", took a few minutes of licking before she had enough and we then went on to a 69 as I spread her cheeks and got to enjoy her sweet pussy as she put a condom on me and started sucking away until I came minutes later.

After the CBJ there is still time on the clock and Cindy massages my legs whilst still in the 69 position which was great as I got to see a nice view of her ass in front of me, she definitely knows how to work it for a mature lady, massage continues across my front until time is up.

As I'm getting wiped down with a hot towel I ask if there are any other girls working here and Cindy tells me that Shelley also works here and that she is a student.

WIR: Not to see Cindy, I found her massage to be on the clinical side as she didn't really seem to engage with me, I might give Shelley a go though. [/COLOR]

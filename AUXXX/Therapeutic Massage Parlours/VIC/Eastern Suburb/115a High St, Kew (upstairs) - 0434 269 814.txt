[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments : 

[/COLOR]They usually advertise in Leader News paper and decided to give them a chance. Called and asked for an appointment, on the phone they said its $70/HR, then I mentioned the price as advertised. They agreed and said I could come straight in. The place is at Kew Junction, upstairs. The place was closed, I called and she said I would be there in 2 min. After 2 min I saw a plump girl coming, opening the door. Went upstairs, pretty amateur set up. Laptop and messy area in one corner. She took the money and ushered me into the room. Freaking cold room!! She started the massage. Her English is ok, she has been here for 2 months and wants to quit the job and go to Sydney to study something. Her massage skills are 4/10. Below average. Then quite for the rest of the time. I had my underwear on. At one stage I said she could take it off. She said it was fine. I was extremely tired that day so kind of dazing off, not because of her relaxing massage! Anyways, I was lying on my stomach the whole time. After sometime she went to get hot towel, came back wiped me off, so I think it was flip, I flipped and I ask for pillow, she said, its finished. 1 Hour Done? I think it was 40 min or less! Anyways, she looked bored as hell and wasn't interested in anything even if she offered. Walked out, never to return.

My experience/comments : I've been following these guys on wechat offering a good massage from young women (don't they all) and get the odd message from them asking me to come in so they seem desperate for business. I took them up on the offer on Tuesday and booked in a 30 minute session.

Plenty of parking behind the shop but no back entrance, you have to walk in via busy High St. Walk up the stairs to an empty room and ping the bell. A cute short girl pops around the corner and asks me how long before taking my money and showing me to the room. Room is a large one with basic setup. I nude up and wait for her to return and get the massage started.

Massage was actually pretty good. For a small frame she can get some force going, using her elbows and jumping on the table. Quite talkative and pleasant to talk to. Before the flip the teasing starts rubbing her fingers along my back then between the crack and reaching under to  play with the tackle. I arch up and give her full access so the tug starts before the flip - love when they do this.

Probably beneficial for them since no one will say no to a tug after that lol. After a bit of play she asks me to flip and asks how much I want to pay. I say $20 for a tug and she counters with $50 for a nude one which I agree. She slowly takes her top and bra off and pulls down her jeans. I'm left looking at a very toned firm body which is a rare find for me in my R&T adventures. She bends over for me to suck her glorious breasts while she's starting the tug. She's happy for me to explore her body, me getting around to grab her tight ass and playing with her trimmed pussy. All this is too much for me and I explode within a few minutes which is disappointing.

She cleans me up and I leave with a bottle of water they offer, a lolly and a smile on my face. I'll definitely be back. She works Tuesday and Sundays here. No one book Tuesdays at 2 - leave that for me!

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

I have had massive blue balls recently and I was keen to check this place out. After further research I managed to locate the cracker add and get the current mobile number.
I called up and found out they had two girls today. One thing which took me by surprise was that they were really well spoken for a R&T place. They were quiet so I popped on over.

As mentioned in the previous review no back entrance, you have to walk in via busy High St. Walk up the long stairs and greated by two ladies. One short asain lady (similar age bracket), a little round and another tall lady. I had the tall lady walk me into the room. The room is really large, looked a bit weird having one table in such a large room. Hope they don't try and divided it into two with a curtain! The only down side of such a large room is that it was on the colder side. The spilt system was struggling to keep it warm.

Once again I wasn't in the mood for a firm massage so I requested a medium pressure. Similar to my recent review on Coco, this girl Sophia nailed the pressure. It was almost a mix between lomi lomi and sweedish. Really really enjoyable. During the massage we had a little small talk. She has only been here for a few months and is a student. She was about 170cm, thin tall body wearing knee high boots and a sexy short dress.  At one stage she was on my back and I could feel her butt (skin) on the back of my leg. I knew straight away she was wearing a g-string or french cut. 20-25 min passes and she begins with the teasing. As per the ealier review I arch up and give her full access which I also love. However she doesn't go for the junk ... just kept teasing around the outter of the sack. This kept going for a good 5 min. Actually my back was getting tired from arching. By now she asks me to flip.

On the turn I get a good look at her face and realise she isn't ealy 20s like I intially thought but older (still attractive though). She asks if I want my "front massage" I say sure.
I try and get a $20 but she insists on a $30 so as the massage was really good I don't mind. She offered $50 for topless but I declined. She then proceeds with a real slow and sensually HJ ... clawing and slow tugs at first. Then the longer it goes the harder the tugs get and eventually I shoot up really hard. Success! As she bends down to get some tissues her short dress rides up and I see black high cut undies. She came across a little cheeky so I think more would be on offer after a few visist. WIR - Yep although I think a few cheeky tugs during the tease would be much better. As per the previous review I am offered a bottle of water on the way out.

Shorter highlighted review since it's the same place and girl.

Some things to note. 
The place has become busy. I went for a mid-week morning session and had to wait, and also had another guy waiting when I was walking out.

The waiting area is a small and the reception lady puts up a small screen but doesn't do anything to shield you from other punters if that worries you.

Ivy looks like she's ages 5 years in the last 3 weeks. She admits that she's very busy. It took a bit of small talk to get her to relax and get her in a happy mood that I saw her in last time.

Still gives a good massage and a great tug.

Might avoid this place for a while for the points I've said above. Plenty of others in the area to explore.

My experience/comments: Like a previous reviewer I've been following these guys on WeChat offering a good massage from young women. I took them up on the offer of a 30 minute session. Just walked in off the street, the place was very quiet. At the top of the stairs I was met by a cute smallish Chinese girl called Ivy, asks me how long, takes my money and then shows me to a largish clean room.

Massage was very good. For a small girl she gave a good strong massage using her elbows and by getting on the table to exert good force. Two thirds of the way into the massage before the flip the massage slows to a sensual rub, the teasing starts rubbing her fingers along my back then between the crack and reaching under to play with Rod and his 2 friends. I open my legs to give her full access.

After a bit of play she asks me to flip and asks if I want extras and how much am I willing to pay.. I say $30 for a tug or $50 for nude which she says it can only be topless as she has her period, but next time would be okay. Feeling generous I say okay to the $50. She takes her top and bra off. What a lovely set of smallish firm tits, I start to play with the nipples, she then bends over to allow me to suck them to my heart’s content, while she is slowly giving me a great tug.  After a few minutes I explode all too quickly….

She cleans me up, I get dressed and pay for the extras, she then gives me a bottle of water on the way out. I might be back but there a few others in the area to try, a new Thai place across the road, a new one in Auburn Road, opposite the Gee-Bung Polo Club in Auburn village. So many choices so little time!!!!.?

I was wondering around junction and again saw lights flashing so decided to sprint upstairs to avoid lot of witnesses around. As I went upstairs there were two massage girls and one of them in very short dress asked me 'How long?'. Before I answer she greeted me again ' Nice day outside - how are you?' I asked for sensual massage for 45 min, she had cheeky smile and took me to the room at far back. I disrobed and a moment later she came in! She started massage-- very average massage! Nothing inspiring and tried to get too close to the goods, but no real tease or build up. After 20 and bit of general brief chit-chat, she asked me if I wanted extra. I asked, whats on offer- HJ and nude HJ. She asked me how much I would pay. I guess  I could get $50 nude HJ but as was just a little short for money, decided to go with HJ and standard now is $30! She accepted the offer and started giving me slow good HJ. She did let me wonder my hands under her dress but not beyond that much! 

After a few min job was done and she gave me a good massage around my hands and face and time was up. Offered bottle of water on my way out. She was friendly and accommodating, and will return to try others!

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Called in hoping to see Joanne who had be recommended. They are at Kew Junction and I heeded upstairs to be greeted by Hebe - cute slim young asian girl. 
Prices were pretty standard. Was shown to the front room and left to undress. 
I took the usual position face down with no draping. Hebe came back in and a really nice massage commenced. Not much chat - I wasn't really in the mood and just enjoyed her hands. Asked if I'd been there before - of course I said yes and I'd seen Joanne (which I hadn't) 
The usual nice hints that more may be on offer when the inside of the thighs were massaged and some accidental touching. 
On the flip the action got closer to the jewels and my excitement was evident. A cute smile and a nod to indicate I wanted the sensual service. 
Negotiated $30 for the HJ. $50 nude was on offer but I didn't go for that as she was too skinny for my liking. Anyway job skilfully done and I left with a smile on my dial. WIR? Maybe to try Joanne if she is more my type. 
They have a sister shop in Blackburn South.

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Called in again hoping to see Joanne who had be recommended. At Kew Junction and I heeded upstairs to be greeted by Sasha - cute young asian girl in a short skirt and a good cleavage on show. 
This time I had the rear room - big and spacious 
I took the usual position face down with no draping. Fairly good massage with not much oil and not much teasing. After about 15min things got a little more interesting when she moved to the head of the table to massage down my back by reaching over my head. I moved my hands from the side to the top of the table and ran them along her legs. No objection so I found my way under her skirt to stroke her bum through her undies. Still OK with this and feeling her pushing into the table as she reached down my back, I moved one hand to the point of the table where her crotch was. She kept up the action as I gently rubbed her through her undies. She then moved back around to the side and started some light finger work over my back and then between the legs coming back up past the family jewels and brushing the date. I let her know I enjoyed that. Time for the flip. I asked straight up if she'd take her clothes off as I was longing to see her boobs. $50 nude was on offer so I accepted. She said she'd give me a nice Body to body. Although a little chubby, she had a nice pair of C cups that she used nicely climbing up on the table and rubbing them all over me. She let me suck on them for a while and then moved down and started a bit of spanish. Unfortunately there had been no oil applied so I wasn't enjoying the friction. I asked for some oil and she jumped off to grab some. She applied a generous amount and started using her skilful hands. I sat up and faced her and with my hands on her boobs and her hands doing their thing while we smiled at each other, the session came to a great end!

My experience/comments : 

I was in the area and was early for my other appointment so decided to try here, so went up the stairs. Man, this is an old school RnT! Dodgy carpet, creaking floors, shit oil, and a smiling lady with a low cut top showing lots of cleavage. Yes, I will have a massage, 30 minutes please, OK, $50 darling, no worries, shown into a dodgy old room, and before long Cherry comes back. Quickly get the business transaction sorted, and for $50 get a nude massage with HJ. My God, this woman has a magnificent set of gravity defying breasts. Worth it for that alone! HJ was OK, and I never really got to experience the massage.

Cherry works Wednesdays.

Anybody got blue balls from an attempted visit here on Saturday? Went past here on legitimate business & found $50 - 2XC 20s & a 10 on the footpath outside.

Possibly some poor punter negotiated a deal but could not come up with the readies.

My experience/comments : 

I was in the area and had some time to kill. Went in, and a very attractive late 30s lady with a suggestive bust came bustling out to see me. Sorry darlink, girl is busy. What about you? I ask. No, me busy too. Come back in 30 minutes. Daisy, new girl, very good. Nothing was going to persuade her otherwise so I slouched off and ended up coming back 30 minutes later.

A dumpy short girl, yet with strangely attractive curves, introduced herself as Daisy. WTF, I handed over my $50, was shown to the back room, and undressed. Daisy came back in just as I was finishing (short time out this time), and gave me a big hug. The hug led to me exploring her short denim shorts and finding a skimpy bit of underwear inside them. 

To cut a long story short, for an extra $50, I got a pretty good nude HJ from a young thing who actually looked better out of her clothes than in.

Thursdays only, and I'd return for Daisy.

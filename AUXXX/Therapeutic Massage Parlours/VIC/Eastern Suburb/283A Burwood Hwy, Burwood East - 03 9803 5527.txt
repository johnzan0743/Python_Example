A very odd situation indeed and not cheap either. Possibly new therapist.

ahh I had a session here a couple months back. It was amazing. Had a 35yo lady who seemed quite experienced and did great stretches and hit all the right places. plenty of teasing too! great tug in the end. I was going to post a review, then for some reason totally forgot. So I've forgotten her name as well  Was actually thinking of going back here but not sure who to ask for... I know this comment wasn't of any help but thought I'd add to it anyway! Come to think of it... her name may be Na Na... something like that.

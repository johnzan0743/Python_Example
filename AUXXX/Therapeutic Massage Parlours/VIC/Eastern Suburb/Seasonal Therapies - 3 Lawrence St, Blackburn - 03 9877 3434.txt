I was in the area and remembered this place from ages ago so I dropped in. The girl who met me at the front desk was Angel. Very attractive from HK I think so I paid my money for 45 mins and headed into the room.

I waited for a while and finally Angel came back. Up until then I really didn't know who I was going to get. With Angel I wasn't disappointed.

I immediately asked her if she will look after all parts of the body and she nodded positively. I asked for soft and sensual and she certainly did this well.

After half an hour she suggested I try another girl which I agreed to and thought why not! The next girl came in, not as attractive but seemed very willing to get straight into it. The 45 mins was $60 and for an extra $20 the second girl did a great HJ.

WIR - Not sure. I don't think any nude or anything would be on offer, but it hit the spot at the time.

Have had a couple of cracks at this place over the past week or so.
Visit 1 - Was with Neko. $70 hour massage, remained covered with towel the whole time. No hint of extra so didn't bother asking. Good massage though but a lot of oil.
Visit 2 - Was with Angel. $60 hour massage (using the voucher they gave me after first visit). Remained uncovered, a couple of accidental brushing of the old fella but was declined extra after asking. Massage was too soft, not much chop.
That's 2 strike outs, the place stinks and I'm not convinced the towels get changes over either. Not much privacy as the rooms are closed off with curtains. This place had now been added to the shit list.

My experience:

Decided to go for a drive on this fine evening and thought I might grab a Subway in Canterbury Rd. Blackburn. Made a left turn to park and noticed a massage sign and flashing coloured lights, forgot about the Subway and wandered in. I was met by a young lady who explained the pricing structure, and suggested I try the one hour firm and relaxation package, which is 30 minutes of pain followed by 30 minutes of relaxation luxury...Lili's words. By the way, the booking was made at 8.45pm and concluded at 9.55pm, so they will go overtime...a big tick.

I was led to a back room and prepared myself, placing discarded clothing in the plastic tub positioned at the foot of the massage table. The room was curtained off but quite large and the table was comfortable. Lili entered the room and started the massage by placing the towel over my behind, and we started chatting about anything and everything. Her massage was excellent, real deep tissue, and her hands reminded of a remedial sports masseur I utilised in my long gone sporting days. Lili did enquire occasionally if I was ok, as I did have moments when I would cease the chatter, for fear of groaning when she hit a sore spot. Lol !!

The relaxation massage began after she had wiped me down thoroughly with hot towels, although she used minimal oil, which made the vigorous massage all the better. I already knew by this stage that there would be nothing else on offer, and to be honest it did not concern me as Lili is a lovely, warm, sincere young lady whose company I totally enjoyed, as the extra 10 minutes attested to.

After cleaning up again, Lili excused herself as I was getting off the table, and she met me at reception. I tipped her and she was honestly surprised. I received a hug and some nice comments...oh, and just for you Wol...Lili handed me a stamped loyalty card. Lol !! I will revisit this young lady soon.

Establishment : Four Seasons Therapies

Date of Visit : 25/06/2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 3 Lawrence St. Blacburn South Vic. 03 9877 3434

Hours of Business : 10am-10pm

Rates : $70 per hour, $50 for half hour

Age : 25 ish

Size/shape : small

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage only it seems

Value for money/recommend? : only for a massage, don't expect anything else.

My experience/comments : Ok so I was on a roll today and thought I'd try this place as well as the one a bit further up in Canterbury road was already closed for the night. So I thought I'd try my luck here.

Firstly I had to wait for a bit as they were busy. Once in I stripped off, ignoring the partially hidden sign to keep underwear on. The girl came back in and proceeded to give a pretty good massage. However there was no tickling of the tackle or any hint of extra services. As a result I left with my load intact. I did get a $5 off coupon, so I may try again when I just want a massage.

Don't count on this place if you want a HJ.

yes my bad.. I normally do get names, but I think this place doesn't offer any extras, it's sadly a legit business so not worth anyone else wasting money on the punt when there are much better options nearby.

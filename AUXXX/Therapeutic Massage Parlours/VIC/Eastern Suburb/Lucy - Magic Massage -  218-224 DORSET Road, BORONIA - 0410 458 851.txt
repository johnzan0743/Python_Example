I was in the area and rang ahead to book Lucy. When I got there another lady showed me into the room, I stripped and waited and waited - maybe 15 mins. Lucy turns up and apologises then starts her work. She also does waxing, but this time I was after a massage and a tug. Lucy does both in a workmanlike and efficient fashion. She is no fashion model and was well and truly covered with a uniform and winter jacket so no fiddling was available, but her pleasant attitude and nicely paced stroking made it a worthwhile trip. $30 extra happily accepted. WIR? Only if I am in the area (which is far from my home territory).

Person's Name : Leila

Establishment : OZ Theraphy

Date of Visit : Mid January (Wed)

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0452217531 / Doncaster Rd (just up from Eastlink)

Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm?

Rates : Lomi $100/hr & Relax $80/hr

Age : 23-25

Size/shape : 8 to 10

Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie

Services Provided : Massage 

Value for money/recommend? : Not really

My experience/comments : Decided to give a Non Asian place a run. Add Appeared in the Leader.  Setup is in a house.  Clean rooms and shower facility.  Anyway made an appointment for later that day and greeted at the door by Leila.  She had a bit of the greenie kinda of look - overall ok looking.  But not my type.  Freindly enough but as the session went on realised she didnt talk too much. Opted for Std relax massage - massage style was ok.  But no gentle brushes or usual indicators. Should have enquired about extras a bit earlier in the session but left it too late.  The answer was NO.  However I think with a few regular visits and the right girl there could be more on offer.  Think I am back to the Asians so probably wont find out.

Location is Doncaster - If you know the area it is just up from Eastern Fwy Docaster road exit (Near the Park and Ride Bus station). They only accept appointments so you would need to call first.  

Not sure if the same place thought that one was closer to Westfield.

Person's Name: Forgot name (She's a Spanish/Colombian chick)

Establishment : OZTherapy

Date of Visit: Late July

Contact Details/Address/Weblink:0452 217 531

Hours of Business: 10-6

Rates:$100 for one hour (I opted for $80 for 45 mins)

Age: Mid to late 20s

Size/shape: Slim, short and very nice tits. Though she does have a big ass I noticed.

Nationality or Ethnicity: Spanish/Colombian

Services Provided: Lomi Lomi Massage only

Value for money/recommend?:Yes

My experience/comments: 
It was a very pleasant massage. I did ask for extras such as hj and cbj, however she said she doesn't do any of those. Extra $20 to do topless was available. Towards the end of the massage, I flipped over and asked if I was able to finish myself off, to which she smiled and nodded. I sat up and pulled her over to me while I stroked myself, while she was massaging my sack. As I stroked, I grabbed and sucked her tits, they were fantastic. Accidentally cummed on her hand, but she was cool with that. Went off for shower after that.

WIR? Yes, she had a fantastic rack

This place is not operating anymore. The owner was operating this shop in conjunction with kew junction, but one has set up 2 shops there. Natalie went to work at Camberwell at Aloha retreat with Rose and some others. Haven't seen her for ages there. Think Nat may have retired or got a job elsewhere. Took her a while to come around but was pretty useful . Only thing was she had a really strong fishy smell DATY. Guess some girls just have it , cos she was clean and not a junkie type at all.

Its a pity that the Doncaster and surrounding suburbs area is a bit of a R&T dead zone. Especially when so many other areas are packed to the brim (ie. The northern suburbs). I know I would appreciate some more local establishments

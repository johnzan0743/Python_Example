Have been here too about a month ago. Didn't post a review because I got not action, plus I'm left working off a tablet and typing anything more than 5 words like this is a pain!!!
 Booked a cute Irish girl off locanto called Ciara. She would have been early- mid 20's. Paid $100 for the hour, nude lomi. She was cute, had big cans, but also had big everything else (size 14-16). Nice friendly girl and all, although the massage lacked any real enthusiasm. Barely any touching of arse, and avoided going too high up between my legs. I reckon I felt her tits touch my back maybe twice, poor use of big cans if you ask me. Flip, ask if I can touch, no was the answer. They offer exchange for $30, which if I'm not mistaken, involves touching???? Didn't go that option, no signs of tug, at the end of the hour she got dressed, left to get me a towel and pretty much threw it on me and left me to mop up the oil myself. Maybe they loosen up on return visits, but plenty of places that are already "loose" on the first visit. Not sure if it's the same owner as Full Circle in Blackburn, but similar MO. Place was clean, don't think a shower is offered which is bad considering you're left feeling like a dolphin that's been caught in an oil slick afterwards. 
I went on a Saturday, they work Mon-Sat. They used to advertise daily on locanto, although haven't seen their ads for over a week or so now.

My experience/comments : 
This review is also posted elsewhere on the wide web.

Running around doing some errands on a day off I finish up and end up sitting at home while it's miserable outside thinking it's probably not a bad idea to find somewhere to drop into for some relaxation.  So on to the usual site to see what's around.  I find a place which looks interesting and call up to make a booking for an hour for some nude lomi lomi.  I arrive and open a door with a charm that jangles at the slightest motion and head up the stairs.  I announce myself, settle the financials and sit to wait for my ML to prepare the room.  She calls me in and we exchange pleasantries while she directs me to strip off and hop on the table before ducking back out.  There's no modesty towel in sight and the room has been heated to a very comfortable level.  She returns with the oil sitting in a jug of hot water before stripping out of a figure hugging dress of some thin and semi transparent fabric.  Now Piper is slightly taller than average height and slender  The oil she poured on to my body was hot but no means uncomfortable.  She began with long strokes over my back and sides before moving on to my legs with good use of her forearms and elbows.  We chat and she tells how she's a trained massage therapist in deep tissue and sports therapy.  We also chat about and compare tattoos.  After 15 minutes she has me flip over where she applies all over my torso, arms and legs and works it in with those long strokes.  I'm unsure if it was intentional but she was brushing past the tackle with her forearm on strokes up and down my thighs.  At the half over mark, she has me flip over again and nearly falling off the oil drench table and back to work on my back, arms and legs.  She would slide a hand up past the tackle and leave it touching while the other hand massaged other parts before sliding her hand down and out.  She would slide over my crack and brush my balls with her finger tips.  At the 45 minute mark she has me flip again on to my back and helps to ensure I don't fall off.  More massaging on my front with the strokes seeming more erotic than earlier.  She didn't mind my hands running over her body and didn't pull away.  I queried her on relief and she whispers that hand relief will be a pineapple.  At this point I couldn't care any more what it was going to cost and nodded to go ahead.  She applies more hot oil  and begins a slow tug alternating between hands and allowing me to wander over her body.  I was able to suck on her nipples and play with her pussy even rubbing oil over her body but she kept her legs together.  I could feel myself building up and lay back to explode all over my stomach.  The only downer to the hour was she stopped tugging too soon and the clean up with the hot towel barely took the oil off and required a trip home to shower before able to go anywhere else.

Overall, some might say a bit on the pricey side but a pretty good massage from a slim brunette who's easy on the eye isn't a bad way to spend an hour.

Whoops, sorry I meant Piper.  I was typing out the templates manually before I realized I only needed to hit a button to have it entered for me so copied one review in order to save me typing out the template twice when I was posting the reviews and trying to get them up quickly and discreetly.

No offer of shower and left to clean myself with towel.  Was also told to not look while ML was getting dressed as she didn't want me to see her undies.  Would like to know other experiences of this place as it's quite local.  I would actually pay for a good lomi-lomi with no tug if there were any suggestions.

Actually, when I saw Jasmine I noticed two oily hand prints on the wall.  When she'd left the room, I positioned myself where the handprints were and it looked like smaller hands, poss female, in semi-doggy position.  Can anyone add any detail about this lady?

Reading other reviews I think Piper & Roxie do the extras, but perhaps not for everyone. I agree hit and miss. Stay away from Tara, and Olivia, definitely nothing doing with either.

Audrey looks average, very average.

Piper looks above average.

By the looks of their facebook page, Roxy from Full Circle Massage is there now. Her name is Katherine, changed to Roxy for the business ha ha!

Doesn't seem like a place I'd even think about going to due to all the bad stuff in this thread.

Hours of Business : 10 to ???

Rates : 110 hour

Age : early 20's ???

Size/shape : Hot!

Nationality or Ethnicity : Pom (Caucasian)

Services Provided : Nude massage 

Value for money/recommend? : Nope

My experience/comments :

This one is strange.  I had some time late afternoon before home so decided to give it a go.  Walked into the room and there was the tell tales of extras + she immediately stripped down to her G-String.  Reasonably tall with a hot body, nice b/c cups and a super pretty face.  The massage was ok.  I wouldn't say great but it was a step above the oil swirling crap that some try to pass off.  I asked about extras and was told "exchange" was all that is on offer for $30 and if I wanted to diy that was $20.  If I wanted to touch her and DIY it was $50 .  I politely declined.  

I'm sure this place is where YMMV depending on the girl but for this one I think this is as far as anybody will get.  Oh well - one for the team I guess.....

I booked Lola in as she looks great in her pictures. The massage she gave is average but she was really friendly and chatty which I like, and she looks great naked, really nice body and face.The extras she offered me (after i built up some rapport and asked nicely) were HJ $100, exchange massage $30 and mabye something else next time.

This is too expensive for me, no matter how good she looks. if you get an hour with her including to cost of the massage thats $210 for a HJ.

I used to see Chanel and Piper who worked there and their rates are much more realistic ($50 for HJ). So I wont be back to see Lola.

Saw Becky the other day. Shes beautiful but her body is kinda average. Shes got a little bit of cellulite on her ass and her tits are kinda saggy with puffy nipples. She gave a really good sensual massage but did not give any extras despite my pleading!

She has 5 years experience with massage and is only in melb for a holiday so i got  the impression that if your a regular there might be extras availabe. but that could also be wishful thinking on my part as i found her very sexy hahaha.

Person's Name : Buffy

Establishment : Tree of Life

Date of Visit : April 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As above

Hours of Business : Unknown

Rates : $70/30 mins + extras

Age : 20s

Size/shape : Skinny geek girl

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian

Services Provided : Nude massage, "bodyslide", "exchange"

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : 

I was in the area and had had a shit afternoon visiting a sick relative. Thought I would give this place a try; it was high in my memory banks, but not from here it would seem, based on the last entry! Parked out back, walked up the stairs, wow! There is this attractive Asian with the most ginormous rack, but alas she was only reception. $70 for 30 mins, which I thought was a bit steep, but later discovered that nude is standard here, so not so bad. A bit of fluffing around while the pretty big titted receptionist found the girl, and out walked Buffy, this skinny Aussie geek girl.

Her attitude was top notch, showed me into the room, and invited me to make myself comfortable. I duly do so, then she comes back in. I hear a few noises, and look around to see that she is disrobing and "skinny" is not so much the best adjective to use, but "malnourished" would work better. We chat about what's on offer, and it was basically +$30 for a bodyslide, and +$30 for an exchange massage. I opt for both. They will occur in the last 10-15 minutes of the booking. Happy for finances at the end. 

Buffy starts what was an average massage, and after about 15 minutes she hops onto the table and brushes her small tits over my arse cheeks. She then gets off the table. I thought this was to be the bodyslide, but then she hops back on and sits on my arse and rubs her breasts over my back. Now her pussy was giving out a lot of heat, which was a nice feeling, and you could tell that she was trying really hard, but it just wasn't fantastic.

She invites me to flip, and it ends up what she calls "exchange" I would call "touching allowed". She's playing all around my cock, and then asks if I would like oil on my hands to finish myself off. I ask if she does it, but she says that's a sexual service which they don't do here. So I finish myself off, shutting my eyes and thinking about the receptionist.

$130 for an average massage and poor extras. The only positives were Buffy's attitude and the receptionist. I'd not return.

Dean

Person's Name : Jasmine

Establishment : Tree of life Mitcham 

Date of Visit : 5/9/18

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 511A maroondah hwy Mitcham

Phone : 0456 584 097

Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm

Rates : $110 ph, includes nude

Age : 25

Size/shape : Curvy size 12

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australia 

Services Provided : Massage, bodyslide, Hj

Value for money/recommend? : Not really

Never tried this place out before but knew it would be exxy. With neither Asian Emma or African Lola on my hitlist working, I bit the bullet & went with number 3, Australian therapist Jasmine. $110 for the hr including Nude is the base service. More went to satisfy curiosity & relax before.work..



Jasmine comes in, not unattractive but not exactly the slim busty stunner I was hoping for.

Big juicy bubble butt yet small A-B cup boobs..

Might work for some but I prefer petite Asian girls with curves in the right places. Asks if I've been here, say yes, but along time ago..



Ask if I can get Lomi Lomi done on an Oiled table. She comments there's not much call for this as clients complain about being too oily..

I don't mind & she agrees to remove the towel.

Table is cracked & a little uncomfortable without the towel..



Thankfully the discomfort was worth persevering with, as the actual massage was among the better Lomi Lomi massages I've had in a long while. Nice medium pressure, long flowing understrokes with attention to the groin area, no issue with touching her bubble butt or a cups, despite lack of financial discussion..



Based from previous reviews, I expected the menu to be rattled off within 10 mins, but at the 20 min mark I took the initiative. Was quoted $50 bodyslide. When swapping for the exchange massage, I truly noticed how high the table was - nearly sprained my ankle. Table height interrupted the flow standing on the ground, & difficulty getting on & off dampened my desire for on table shenanigans.



Put the towel back on before cautiously climbing on the cracked bed for the bodyslide.

While extra points are given for having All of her body sliding over me (as opposed to the ass up chest rub many girls consider a "bodyslide")

it still lacked the enthusiasm & sensuality needed to elevate it from just another extra..



She hops off to resume more massage, offers hand relief for an extra $50.but accepted $40, for a total of $230. Having been my 3rd punt within a week, the inevitable quickly came..

Was wiped off with a hot towel in the absence of showers, hence the complaints of proper Lomi being too oily.



While I agree with the inevitable "cheaper.going to a brothel" comments, at that.moment I had more money than time & this place is conveniently near a station, plus the massage itself was of a Much higher standard I could expect in a brothel..

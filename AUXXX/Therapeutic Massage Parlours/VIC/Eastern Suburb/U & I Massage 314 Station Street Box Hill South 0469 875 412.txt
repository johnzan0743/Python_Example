I did a Brauninc drive by. I had an appointment in Camberwell and on the way I drove down Station St. and noticed a new venue. What else did I see......an attractive, long haired sweet thing going to the door and open up. It was 10.20 am

She was wearing a pair of tight fitting, light coloured jeans, and a loose summer top.  She was carrying a bag and an article of clothing over her arm..uhm

I parked, checked my timings and found that I did not have enough time for some entertainment.
However as this is a new venue, I wanted to see what the setup was inside the shop.

Entered and who comes to meet me. Her...this time dressed in a very short, little black dress, with mesh top and no bra. ....oh bugger....asked the pricing and got shown a sign $50 for 30 etc.....

I said I was sorry but could not stay...I asked her name and she replied Kelly...she would have been young 20's, B+ breasts (?), long black hair, medium build, pretty face.


Bugger ...have to go....I will try to return....

Just googled it, can't believe one has opened up in this 5 shop block.  If your going to have a session in Box hill, it has to be Whitehorse towers lol

Had a physical look yesterday, it is a very ugly looking shop, and if u don't have the punters eye that most of us have, it would be very easy to drive past and not notice it

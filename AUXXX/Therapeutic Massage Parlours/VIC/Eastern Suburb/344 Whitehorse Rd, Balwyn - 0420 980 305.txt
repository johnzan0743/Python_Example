My experience/comments : Was a Sat morning.....Wanted a quick session just to try the place out as was in a good location.  As mentioned down the back behind the dentist.  The lady I saw think her name was Julie (She was like the manager of the shop).  Gave the usual quick hands over body massage.  Recall she had big tits.  Was a nice site....Standard tug.  Maybe more on offer if you became a regular.  She knows how to to business as I mentioned I was keen for a student type girl.  Come Monday she said pretty young girl.  So I did.  (Next review)

My experience/comments : Follow on from last post I pre booked Michelle.  When I turned up was busy for 20 minutes or so.  Manager (Julie I think) tried the hard sell 30 minutes with her while I wait. Ready has sessioned her so Refused and chose to wait it out.  I think the oversell of Michelle put a negative mood.  Michelle is a nice girl just not what I was after.  She was a bit on the chubby side and plain in looks.  Service was good allowed touching and a nice personality.  These two sessions were enough for me and I have not returned.  I especially hate the pushy scamming type shop managers. Maybe there are some better girls there now????

Hi all, 3rd Post/review
Phoned ahead, thinking I was phoning the other Whitehorse Rd place even though I had this places address in the paper. I said I could be there in 30mins and lady said that was fine and had 2 girls. Rolled up and realised it was a different place to the first but I had driven past this one once before. got ther in about 40 mins (running late), this place is a house converted to business. A dentist in the front and we go around the back to the left and ring the bell on the door of what looks like a bit of an extention. Was let in by bussiness runner (as described above) who was the only person there, no sign of 2 girls. I didn't ask as it would of changed the atmosphere. I asked for 30 mins, handed over the sking price of $70 and started to undress. After a few item of mine where off I asked if she was going to undress too, she said "oh, nude, OK" and started to undress too. hmmm I thought, nice body but not toned or sexy, just naturally small with a slight tum. Massage was OK, I drifted away for a bit, I was acturally wished I asked for longer. Flipped over and a bit more here and there and my half mast was obvious. She did a ticle of the balls, had a little giggle then continue on legs. Then did that chopping action but with the cupped hands, which was loud and killed my mood. It seemed to go on forever....and ever....until that was finished with and it was back to the ball teasing region. she continued to play and gave the HJ (assuming that the 'H' means Hand and not Head). yerrr it was OK but nothing great, I didn't need to resort to my Viet Girl from Quiet American dreams. As we got dressed conversation took place and I could see sense she was not having a great business day, wished she was somewhere else, and seemed a little too keen to get back to her little snack she put to one side when I arrived. I managed not to bring up that she said there were 2 girls to me whilst on the phone. Anyway this last few minutes bought my mojo down and was't why I was there. Ok so not as bad as my first two reviews but not overly impressive either. My next review is a much needed pleasent surprise.

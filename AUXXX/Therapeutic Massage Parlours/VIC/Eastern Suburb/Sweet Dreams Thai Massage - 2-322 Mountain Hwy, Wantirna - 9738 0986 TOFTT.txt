My experience/comments : 
A TOFTT moment.  I was cruising past with some time to spare so stopped in here thinking it was Birds of Paradise massage around the back and not checking the business name too closely.  It's located next door and below Serenity Palms.  Location wise it's quite open with a cafe located across the driveway so you'll be entering past all the outdoor diners.

I was met by a middle aged Thai lady in her 40s who looked quite aged in her face.  She was slim and tall though dressed in black leggings and a black T-shirt.  I was lead into the first massage room and was left to undress.  Hopping on the table and pushing the Thai massage wrap/sheet aside while waiting for her to return.  She returns and drapes me with the sheet before beginning a firm Thai massage.  On the flip she keeps me draped by focusing on massaging my legs and arms and I inquire of extras as mini me was beginning to poke his head into the sheet.  She unfortunately declined saying she doesn't do that so I left it be and just enjoyed the remaining massage for what it was.  Now the massage is well worth the visit if you're after a legit massage and I left feeling a million dollars.  

Unfortunately been under the weather a bit since this visit and I've forgotten her name.

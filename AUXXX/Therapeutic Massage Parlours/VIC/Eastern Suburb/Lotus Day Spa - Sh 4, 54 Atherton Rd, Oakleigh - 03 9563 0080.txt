Services Provided :  Massage

Value for money/recommend? :Not the worst but not great
My experience/comments : I saw this place advertised in the Leader and hadn't seen any reviews of it so I decided to make a sacrificial visit today.It is a shop front with full signage and price/service leaflets,which from my experience usually means no extras.There were 3 girls there but one may have been the manager or receptionist and I was not able to choose who I would see.Two of the girls were dressed in short skirts and looked like they might have had a bit of dash in them and the third girl was the one I got!Upon being shown to the room I made the following observations trying to work out whether extras could be had.Proper room with a door and walls that joined the ceiling-good sign,tissues in the room-very good sign,window in the door-bad sign,masseuse wearing jeans and windcheater-bad sign.
I paid for half an hour and got a very average massage,which was more of an oil spreading exercise than a massage but it may have partially been my fault as I asked for a soft massage.There was no flip,it was all done face down and she didn't even see my dick,let alone get anywhere near it.She left the room as soon as she finished and there was absolutely no opportunity to discuss any extras.It wasn't a terrible experience but it was certainly very forgettable.Those tissues must be there for a reason so I will try one more time with another girl and see how I go.They offer a free 30 minute massage after 8 visits but I won't be getting that far if things don't improve on the next visit.

Save your money champ. I was sure these places had something going on and stupidly went enough times to fill one of their freebie cards. No joy. They also have a store in Prahran (Tokyo Fantasy) and Malvern. Got kind of close once but even with multiple visits to the same girl, nada. Normally don't have to encourage girls too much to give me a hand, so to speak, but despite the signs these places are fruitless. Spend your hard earned elsewhere.

Talking of Tokyo Fantasy in Prahran. I went
before the costume offer. They were offering free sake
with massage. Upon entering the room, I asked, Sake? 
and she said, No, we just do straight massage here.
Anyway, after a while she brought a cup of cold sake for
me and after a swig I was ready for some slap and tickle
But nothing but massage. These places with alcohol , short skirts,
young girls ( who aren't trained in massage) and even
school girl fantasy outfits are absolute mind fucks.

I went to Tokyo Fantasy a few months ago with high expectations.If a Tokyo fantasy consists of wasting money on a few pokes and prods from a clueless,disinterested Chinese girl in a white shirt,then I think I'll stick to my plain old Melbourne fantasies.

Date of Visit : 29/04/2013

Services Provided : Massage + H/J

Value for money/recommend? : Yes/yes

My experience/comments : Have not been to this place in over a few months, but I was in need of a nice massage and hopefully a lovely happy ending. Walked in about 6:20pm on a Monday night, must have been a slow night as one of the girls was just getting ready and wanting to go home. Receptionist (who's English, and money skills were appealing) asked the girl if she was able to do a 30min massage. She obliged with a friendly smile. Shown to room, and left to get undressed. Girl arrived back before I even had time to get my pants off, so i was left thinking do i leave underwear on or take off. There was no towel to cover myself with, but me being me I just went and took all off and strolled to the table. Trying to see where her eyes looked as I done so.
Girl was very friendly and talkative, asked me what kind of massage i would like and the pressure, then asked if oil was ok.
Was very liberal with the oil, and had an interesting massage method and she also combined the use of her nails which felt really good! She did a full massage from neck to ankles (no feet), Inside of thigh and softly tickled her nails over my perineum and scrotum.
She then asked me to roll over, massaging my chest and abdomen first and then oiling up each leg as she went. Not caring if she accidentally bumped my penis, i actually think she started to do it on purpose to see if she could get any movement out of it. She then got up on the bed in between my legs and ran her hands from shins all the way up to my chest, and back down again she did this for a good minute or two and it felt great. Brushing past my semi erect penis every time. She then got off the table and asked if it was okay to massage groin area...and as if it wasn't after what I had just let her do....ha 
She said it was $30 extra......... I asked what could I get for $50, but was told sorry, only HJ for $30 but i could touch anywhere on outside of her clothes (which I did)
She gave a very slow attentive hand job, she did not want to rush it, and have it over and done with like other happy-ending i have experienced.
Even though I stopped this young lady from going home early, she really was attentive and gave me the best bang for my buck.

Age : ~32 (but looks 25)

Size/shape : B to C, good bodied, attractive

Nationality or Ethnicity : Vientamese

Services Provided : a good massage with a nice HJ to finish things off 

Value for money/recommend? : Yes 7.5 out of 10 for looks and skills

My experience/comments :

Just by luck the girl sent to me was a Vietnamese hotty called Sasha. She quickly put me to ease and got into all the right spots giving a professional massage with just a hint that here might be more on offer. True to form Sasha didn't disappoint and asked me to roll over.

Sasha's HJ work was skilled and not rushed. Afterwards there was a nice hot towel provided and everything was as a good as new.

She said she was 32 and if that is true she looks fantastic for her age. I thought she looked more like 25 but who's complaining.

I pushed for a little extra but she said HJ was all she did. Might be something I need to work on during a future visit.

Thanks for the review of Sasha. There is also a Vietnamese Sasha round the corner at 240c Huntingdale Rd. Might be the same girl. She also had fantastic massage skills and wouldn't go nude either...

Maybe because this is the area of the forum that reviews places that aren't legit.
If anything,it should be under South Eastern instead of Eastern suburbs.

[COLOR=#333333]The establishment is clean and tidy. Room is seperated with a door. Looks like a proper MP until she asked me to remove my underwear before starting. She said she is a student from China but...seriously, she looked like a mother of 2. The massage was pretty good, strong if u want. Then asked to turn over, with my stick dangling the entire time.
[/COLOR]
She continued massage on my front pretending not to pay any attention to it, but I was thoroughly aroused. Then she said it's done! Wow, forced me to ask the question and she said 30. [COLOR=#333333]Touching was not allow. HJ is purely mechanical. Its over in a few minutes.

This place is better for proper massage than a tug. Did not see any pretty face on that establishment as well. The Kohfeel MP a few doors down the road has some pretty thai. Might want to give that a try.

Funny how this one came about... I never would have suspected it as an R&T in the very central, public spot it is in and I headed in by accident one day for a head and neck massage with the last $25 in my pocket. Once in there, a very cute and petite, short-haired, sweet-faced Asian girl called Yuki (Chinese tho, not Japanese) was introduced to me and I laid down on the massage table for a head and neck massage. After much incidental rubbing and the general vibe that there was far more on offer, I returned two days later.
Sure enough, with a full body massage it was dacks off right from the outset with no towel. After a weak massage and some finger tip caressing of my arse and balls, then it was flip time and surprise, surprise, "do you want me to do the front too?". My response... "yes, and what else is on offer?" and not a lot it seems. After some pathetic, "I'm thinking with the little man" puppy dog moments from me to try and get her to remove clothing or let me rub her snatch, I lay back and settle for a decent HJ but Yuki is very cold and mechanical and only lets me rub her ass over the clothes... no titty grab, no pussy rubbing and I get a death stare when I try to slip my hand under her clothes to feel bare arse.
She gets me over the line and is giving me cheeky, almost sarcastic smirks as I clean myself up, probably thinking "fool!" and she is right! FYI, I went back a week later hoping that my repeat business would grease the wheels a little and get me further... but 70 wasted dollars later still no dice.

Poped in here for a look this saturday.  Met 2 girls, they looked thai, not overly attractive. The 2nd girl came out in a shiny tanktop with writing on it that read" forever young". I told her, there is a forever young massage franchise taking over melbourne, she laughed and asked if i wanted massage. I told her, i was going to check out some other shops. I dont think this place is still part of the franchise, the girls just did not have that forever young look.

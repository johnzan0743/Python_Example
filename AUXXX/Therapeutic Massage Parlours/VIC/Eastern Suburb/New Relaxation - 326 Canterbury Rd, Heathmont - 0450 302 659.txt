My experience/comments :
Saw this new place advertised and thought check it out. It is a old house and has all the hallmarks of an RNT AMP. Even the girl was dressed in one of those tight dresses that hinted at an easy disrobing. Unfortunately I must have given off the wrong vibe as I only received a massage. I asked if she did hand relief and she said "no, not here" The massage was so so and I cannot say I will be back. I am hoping another punter might give it a try and see if more is on offer. I am sure it is as I cannot see how a business operating out of an old house in the suburbs could last with what was a mediocre straight massage.

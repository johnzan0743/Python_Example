My experience / comments:

Easy to arrange a booking, quite friends and enthuasiatic on the phone. Arrive at private house where she has a salon set up.
Greeted by late 30s early 40s Chinese woman with welcoming smile, very tight figure, wearing tights and normal jumper. Shown into warm salon with heater on.
Take everything off and lay down waiting for her to come back. Great massage to start whilst towel on, applying pressure all over the body, warming up for later. Once complete she moves towel off areas she's massaging. At this stage the warm oil she has heated is applied and she starts a great massage.
Revealing parts of your body when she's ready to massage. She gets very close to your butt, then starts to massage your butt, which is great.
After the normal massage is complete which is hard pressure, she starts to massage all over again with soft and very sensual strokes, increasing your anticipation of whats on offer. She starts to massage your butt and starts to tickle. She has great strong hands but knows how to go soft. She continues to tickle and starts to move under your body whilst your still laid faced down, grabing with her oily hand.
All the while she is very happy to chat and flirt and always in a great mood. She asks you to turn over with a smile, finally the towel off completely.
I think she likes touching younger blokes. She continues now with normal massage on your chest and stomach which is great. Finally she begins what we waiting for, responsive to requests of more gusto, and reveling at the pace and passion. She continues til your all done with a strong hand you need to tell her to stop. Later asks if that was robust enough with a cheeky smile. Clean off continue nice chit chat, seems like she's happy to have customers.
Great experience would definitely go again.

 My experience / comments:

Arrive at private house where she has a salon set up. Entrance is via a side gate, opened the gate with a doorbell at the back door of the house. 
 Greeted by late 30s early 40s Chinese woman with welcoming smile, slim figure, wearing track pants and a t shirt. Shown into the salon which was a little cold.
 Take everything off and lay down waiting for her to come back. Great massage to start whilst towel on, applying pressure all over the body. Once complete she moves towel off areas she's massaging. At this stage the warm oil she has heated is applied and she starts a great massage.
 Revealing parts of your body when she's ready to massage. She gets very close to your butt, then starts to massage your butt, which is great.

She asks you to turn over. She continues now with normal massage on your legs which is great. Asked for  and said no  
I did hear a hair dryer going in the background at one point, so maybe she wouldn't do it with a new customer with family in the house, not sure....
She did mention that she has received a lot of phone calls lately, and asked me where I had seen her ad. 
She did say she hasn't advertised for some time and was very curious about new interest in her massage service. I guess this is due to Tricky's post.
Great massage, would go again if in the area.

My experience/comments : Jasmine stank of cigarette smoke, had a poor attitude, and gave a crap massage. Checked up front whether or not anything extra was on the table, absolutely not. Had need of a proper massage anyway. It was crap. Big mistake. Avoid.

On the way out, I saw a very cute young thing who was wearing a furry dressing gown and (it appeared) not much else.

I popped in there yesterday, to be shown to a room by a very attractive young PRC called Mimi. What was encouraging when I went in was they had rearranged and there was a sofa, covered with a sheet and a pillow, as well as a massage table. Mimi re-entered, I asked about extras. "No," she said. "Only massage."

"What about the other lady?"

"No, we only do straight massage here."

That was fine, I collected by $40, got dressed and moved on.

The message was pretty clear...

cl-clean.... you just beat me to it. I visited this place on Sat and saw Minnie (same girl as you did).....here's an account of my experience....

After a not so positive review of this place I thought I’d step up to see if I would have more luck. Called ahead for a half hour massage. Turned up, could smell the cigarette stench, and see the old girl behind the desk. Thankfully I hear another voice from around the corner call me into one of the rooms. It is Minnie, a fairly pretty, relatively tall, skinny girl with a friendly disposition. She asks me to undress and leaves the room. I leave my jocks on, and when she returns, I ask if I can take them off – yes she says, and turns away while I do.

On the table and Minnie asks me if I want a light, medium or hard massage – ‘hard’, I respond. She places a towel over me and starts to apply pressure. This is not off to a good start I think. The towel is moved down over my legs and my legs then get a turn. However, Minnie then lifts the towel so that my back and bottom are exposed, and uses oil in a very firm massage across my back. She then starts with long strokes that start at my bottom and end at my shoulder. Throughout this she uses hands, forearms and elbows to great effect.

Next are my legs. She conducts a very sensual massage on the back of my legs with her very smooth hands and with the right amount of pressure. She travels along my inner thigh but stays away from the prize. At one point I perked up as her strokes along my inner thigh, because they were quite forceful, were pulling my legs outwards.

Minnie leaves, and returns with a towel and some water to wipe down my back. Before she does I ask what the price for one hour ($70) and whether I can extend my session because I am enjoying it so much. She says I will have to pay another $40 for an additional half our session, and suggests I book an hour next time. I find this rather strange – why would you not extend a half hour session to a full hour session when there are two MLs and no other punters?

The session finishes after 30 minutes, and with no flip. I did not ask for, nor were any extras offered. The massage, however, was very good, and ironically, quite sensual. I would return for the massage alone….

There was a chick called Sarah (I think) who worked here a few years ago. She was good value! Tugs no issue, and I think topless or nude. I wonder what happened to her.

For many years this shop was known for being open till 1am, yet they only provided a straight massage or a clothed one, NO NAKED.  Popped in on Saturday to find a girl coming out of a room, she told me they were busy. Nice enough face, young looking, wearing a short black dress, a nightclub like outfit.  I do not think they have the same strict policy anymore.

I have been here in 2016 and was not a member of this forum at that time to write a review.

My experience was as similar to everyone else's experience in this thread. It was just a massage, no flip. I left with blue balls. But if i remember right they have a shower and i may have taken a shower before leaving

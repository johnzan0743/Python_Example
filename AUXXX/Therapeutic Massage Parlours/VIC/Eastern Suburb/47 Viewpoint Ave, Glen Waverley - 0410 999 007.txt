Person's Name : Chloe

Establishment : 47 Viewpoint Ave, Glen Waverley

Date of Visit : 6/11/11

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 95603789

Hours of Business :  11-8 7 days

Rates :$50/30mins

Age : late 20's

Size/shape : slim size 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage  and tug

Value for money/recommend? : enjoyed my first not so much second ( I won't be back)

My experience/comments : saw an add on Gumtree for Nuru massage
so was very curious rang the number and the female said that they were
opening the next day but the lady who does the Nuru was overseas and
would return in a months time. I ended up going in the next day to make sure.
One girl there, Chloe, poss 28ish. Slim, nice looking. $40 opening special
gave a good medium massage. I asked about Nuru and she said that the business
did not offer it. After some prodding she said the owner put it in to get punters in the 
door. I flipped and asked for a soft massage. As I responded to the softness she
asked if I wanted hand relief for $20. Of course. A nice rub resulted in a good climax.
I walked away thinking this place is going to be a regular. 
Second visit a week later. This place was much busier. Punters ringing and in waiting room. Again had Chloe, she seems to manage the place, another girl Cici was with a client. I didn't get a chance to check her out. Anyway, price up to $50 /  30mins as open 
Special has finished. Showed into a smaller room next to reception desk. Chloe gave a 
nice massage again but was constantly answering the phone, attending to
walk ins as well. A pet hate is paying for a massage and
having this happen. Chloe has a nice manner and was able to keep me happy.
I walked away knowing that I won't be back as I tipped my hat to the police academy across the road.

Haha, police academy across the road. They can wander over in their lunch break for a quick massage. Shame they don't offer Nuru then. Must be something on offer if it's so busy so soon though?

Well, what do you know. I was in the area and heard Chloe's words in my head
last time I visited she kept saying the Tuesday girl was really good.
Anyway, made a booking and after she rang back to change the time, I got
a massage from Vicky. Vicky is early 20's, quiet and pretty. Massage is okay
HJ not as good as Chloe and she stands as far away from wandering hands as possible.
She looked like she had an ample breast under her jacket. HJ has gone up to $30 extra.
This place just gets busier. Had to walk past a trio of sniggering school lads on the way in and 
on exit the Milk Bar owner was out the front of his shop and gave me a wry smile.
Maybe I'm paranoid. Keep saying I won't be back but sure is closeby and open
everyday.

Back again this week. Chloe suggested try Hanee ( maybe honey)
So made a booking and by the time I arrived Chloe told me Hanee is
calling herself Eva now. Anyway, CeeCee apparently is going to give the
first 20mins and then Eva will do last 10.
CeeCee is quite young and innocent looking.
Gives a reasonable massage but does not 'complete' the job
So after 20 mins she leaves the room. A couple of mins later
I'm thinking they've forgotten about me. Knock on the 
door and it's Eva. 'Happy ending?' she asks in the doorway
a little too loud for my liking. Eva is about 23. Slender, short bob
and around the six foot mark. She tells me to flip and wants $20
upfront. I assure her I'm a regular and wont reneg. Any she gets those
long slender fingers working away and sprays about 100ml of oil all over
my area of attention. After 5 mins it's obvious these tables are at a height
for the average size PRC and she gets on her knees to continue. I kind of liked
this image and after  a few more minutes I was there. Quite happily she kept 
going slowly till I said she can clean up. I like this one. As I get up to put my pants on she walks
out and again in the doorway / corridor she asks a little too loudly
'$20'. I like this one

I've been here twice and also had no success.

First time I had a very new girl for massage who, putting it politely, didn't know what she was doing. After 20 minutes of extremely limited massage the manager came in, apologised and took over the massage. She did say that there were some experienced 'friendly' girls there on other days and I should come back another time.  

Figuring that I was just unlucky on my first visit I went back again last week for another try. I hadn't booked previously so this time I rang to find out which girls were working. I mentioned that last time I had a new girl and wasn't really happy with the massage and could I see one of the more experienced girls.

When I arrived I was shown into the room, undressed and lay down. A girl walked in, said hello and started the massage. It took a few minutes before I realised it was the same girl from my first visit. Her massage technique had improved but there was no hint of any extras. I asked if she massaged the front but she said that she doesn't do that. 5 minutes before my booking was due to finish the manager came in and took over. She made some small talk and jokingly? asked if I worked for the police.

Not sure if they are just being extra careful or maybe I seemed suspicious for some reason... Anyway, I won't be back.

Person's Name : Echo (at least that’s what it sounded like…)

Date of Visit : 8/02/12

Rates :$50/30mins

Age : early to mid 20's ?

Size/shape : slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage and tug

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, I’d probably try somebody else next time but the massage was good

My experience/comments : I was in the area and decided to give this place a final try, especially in light of recent posts.
The place was busy so I had to wait 10 minutes or so before being shown to the back room. The masseuse was a slim, attractive girl although wearing plenty of clothes! I believe that her name was Echo (or something very similar).
I must admit, she gave a good massage; much better than I was expecting. There was some nice touching that was a bit too frequent to be accidental, so my hopes were up (as was something else!) for a better experience than my past few visits.
On the flip she continued the massage before asking if I wanted extras since I had been there before. The only extra she indicated was a tug for $30. I mentioned that I thought the tug was usually $20 but she just stared blankly and said $30. Not in much of a position or state of mind to argue I agreed…
Some more oil and a nice tug followed. Not much variation in strokes or ball play, etc. but was very pleasant if a bit rushed. After completion she left the room and returned with a hot towel to wipe off the oil.
A nice, enjoyable session!

Had a Chinese who goes by the name Sofie, has a great deal of promise or is all talk, not sure which at this stage. She is very attractive and has a good command of English. I think she thinks she is worth more than she is for services required.

Only allowed RnT on this visit, T was $20 extra, but no touching,  she said next time she would consider more, but implied it could be costly. Massage was light but okay.

Will give full report after next visit. This girl is supposed to work on Mondays.

Person's Name : Cici

Establishment : 47 Viewpoint Ave, Glen Waverley

Date of Visit : 13/3/12

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 95603789

Hours of Business : 11-8 7 days

Rates :$70/60mins

Age : late 20's

Size/shape : slim size 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage/no extras

Value for money/recommend? : enjoyed my first but maybe try again...

Hey everyone, My first post here but not very eventful
Went to this place today and had a massage with Cici, I booked for 4pm and waited for 2 mins then got taken in, I arrived 10 mins early, So down to the massage after getting shown in and waiting on the table for about 5 minutes. I heard Cici arrive as she must of been on call as the girls said hi to her out in the hall way...I stripped off and got on the table and she started with the back massage. She began with nice flowing strokes all over my back and butt and that was nice and relaxing, honestly a good light massage, saving her energy though. She did have her moments of brushing her leg against my skin of my arm. She was wearing this hot white short frilly dress and she went on to ask if it was my first time here...I said yes. (probably the first mistake...) and just said "oh ok" and kept on going. down to the back of my legs and she didn't mind rubbing up my legs and brushing against my balls a couple of times. Turned over for a front of leg massage and she was making the obvious brushing near my balls again and then my hands brushing against the inside of her incredibly smooth legs. (Love the smoothness of Asian legs!!) that was the main part that got me hard. I didn't do any touching though as it was my first time. Didn't want to scare her or make her uncomfortable. Then when she finished both my legs she said. "Ok" "Did you like my service" I Said, "Yes very much thank you" with a smile. Then she proceeded to get her things to leave and I asked politely if there's any extras. With "No Sorry" in a soft voice. Then left the room. Got changed and looked at the time. It was 4.43???? Im like wtf? I booked an hour....Went outside and said i thought i booked an hour and she said "Yes" and I asked if we started at 4.55? she said "Noooo" in an Asian way lol! And I just said ok I'll book in next week sometime....

Conclusion: No RnT just massage. Do you think maybe next time? Maybe they don't trust me yet? mind you there is the Police Academy up the road lol. I would be worried as well as I'm a massage therapist my self lol! PacificBrown I know you went there with Cici? How did you go?
So im booking next week maybe Monday and see how things go and if its no again im gonna take my money to somewhere more reliable on these forums

Hope you liked the review. (to all it was lol)
Cheers

Haven't been for ages as with a recent post stating they were giving FS I thought this place was ripe for a visit from the 
authorities. When I was going I always found Chloe to be the best. Cici was very young and didn't give HJ
when I was there but Chloe said on my last visit to give her a try as she was ready to do it.
I rang up out of curiosity recently and sounds like a lot of new staff there.
I'm not going near the place either way.

Haven't been to this place for a few weeks since my last visit. Thought I would give it another try. Same girl Chloe on reception. Not sure if she remembers me, or not. Paid $70 for an hour. Into the room and strip off and wait for the talent to arrive. A fairly cheeky looking girl called Anna comes in. She does look Hot. She told me she was Japanese. Who knows, I told her I was Chinese. 

We acted like little kids, I would stare at her and she would stare back and say what's the matter? Then we both start to giggle. Until I said ok let's get started! She stood in front of my head and was wearing black stocking, with a short tight black dress. My hands were just touching her legs, then she bent down with her boobs almost touching my back. That's the thing with these places you don't know how far to push the boundaries. I really wanted to run my hands up her legs but held back. The massage was just ok. I actually like a really hard massage where it starts to hurt your muscles. Her technique was soft and gentle. After about 10 mins she asked me if I like it hard, or soft. I said if you can start off hard then go soft towards the end. Well nothing really changed it was still the same. Can't say it was a sensual massage until roll over. More giggling and laughing every time I looked at her, or put my head up. Continued on till she asked me to roll over. 

She starts to oil my legs and then stomach and gets pretty close to my junk. I start to get hard just looking and thinking about her. She keeps asking me what am I thinking about. She bumps my now extended plaything and says "oh sorry that was an accident." "I say can you do more accidents?" "Oh know I don't do that." "I say last time I was here the girl with glasses did for $20." But for the hell of me I couldn't remember her name! Anyway after a little negotiating she says $30 and I say go ahead. She asks me if it's ok to jump on the table and then puts my leg right under her two legs fairly firmly sitting on top. Didn't really give me much access to touch her apart from her legs and hands. But it was a nice feeling all the same. She oils up with two hands starts rubbing me up and down and around my balls. I ask her to take it slow and gentle then take her hand and rub it up and down all over, a little bit harder. The pace continues and I watch her face and mouth. She looks like she is really getting into it, making little puffing noises till I EXPLODE! Then I ask her to slow down. 

Clean up, give her a tip and leave with a thank you. It's weird going from a brothel where everything goes to a massage, where everything is a challenge. But I did leave feeling like I reached my goal today.

WIR: Probably not with her, try someone else there.

I have tried Helen before. She is very attractive, the massage is good, plenty of "accidental" touches in the right places. Not very talkative but her English is quite good. The problem was that after my first visit, she promised nude on my next. Despite offering a fair bit extra, she declined. I don't mind someone saying no but don't make a promise if you don't intend to deliver. The HJ was still good though so I wasn't completely disappointed but I won't be going back to her again.

I like Viewpoint, I have had good massage and HJ there a number of times, this certainly wasn't one of them!

Tiffany was the only girl available and I was a bit short on time, took a chance and booked her for 45 minutes. HJ was agreed to upfront for $25. No nude available.

On the bench, face down, asked her to concentrate on legs and bum. So she starts on lower back, mechanical, asked her to shift a bit further down after 10 minutes. Starts on legs, 5 minutes on each still no "accidental" touches or tickles. Lots of time massaging my ankles! Asked her to massage between legs so she starts on inner thigh. Still no touches, getting worried, about 30 minutes gone, completely not aroused. She asks me to flip, once again I asked her for a bit between the legs and bum. So straight to the old fellow and starts vigorous tug. No finesse at all. So I roll over, she applies more oil, I am barely hard, came quickly.

A complete waste of time! She needs lessons from Chloe.

So who did you have? What did you receive? Did you ask for any extras? Did you get any extras? "Lame" doesn't tell us much!

The service is very much varied here depending on the girl. It also depends on whether you take the initiative or not.

Man I must've been unlucky.  Saw Lulu here over a year ago now and she tried to charge $50 for HJ!  I told her where to stick it, went away with blue balls and (obviously) haven't been back.  Might have to try again at some stage given no-one else seems to be charged that much!

Person's Name : Coco (I think)

Establishment : 47 Viewpoint St,  Glen Waverley

Date of Visit : 2/12/2012

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :  

Hours of Business : 10am - 7pm

Rates : $70 per hr

Age : Early/Mid 20s

Size/shape : slim and tall - probably a size 6

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage, HJ offered

Value for money/recommend? :  Yes.   

My experience/comments : I believe this place is owned by the same people as the shop on 240 Huntingdale Rd. Girls seem to shop between shops. 

Coco is one of the better girls I've had here. She's worked in a shopping centre massage shop before so she definately knows how to give a firm massage. 

Worked on upper body a tad longer than I like, but once she reached the bum area, she offered plenty of teasing. She has this one move where she slides her whole hand and arm between my legs and under body - feels great!

Told me to flip over, and kept giving me a look waiting for me to make the first move. She eventually offered extras for $30, and wouldn't go any lower. 

Good technique, will visit her again.

Date of Visit : 31/1/13

Rates :$70/60mins

Age : mid 20's ?

Size/shape : Medium

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : massage and tug $30

Value for money/recommend? Hell no!!

I went to this place today thinking it'll be alright its been a while. Nup...Still shit.... I booked for 1 hour. I got there on time and was into the room I go, I checked the clock at reception and my phone, both were saying equal time. I got into the last room down the hall and there is that massive clock on the wall that I'm sure most of you have seen. It was 15mins FAST!!! WTF?? I didn't say anything. 

Got my services that i went for but massage was just average. No tickle, just sensual, but good for the blood flow since I've been training a bit lately. Anyway onto the flip yeah a bit of teasing while she massaged one leg and then the questioned popped. Yes please. finished the job, poor effort by her though... But wait get this... the phone rang twice during the massage first was in the first 15 mins then while the tug was happening and she still had the F****** nerve to still answer it!!!  So after the tug and thinking she was going to get away with a 40 minute massage when I paid $70 hard earned bucks for my 60 minutes!!!! I said to her "your clock is wrong" and "there is still 20 mins to go...." She stepped out of the room to check the clock and she came back but with a bad ass attitude then said "Ok sir we do more massage" I offered not to pay for the tug so I could GTFO!! She was like "Nooo Noo" I do massage. Me: "Ahh FFS" (In my mind i said that lol) Shit boring massage after that. And that was it....  

WIR: Not to anyone!! This place has such poor service now. Your dollars are better spent elsewhere. But if you like any of the girls here, which I'm sure some of you blokes have your favs. Anna is mine. But even she has skimped on time 1once or 2wice with me. I'm so over it now. I will never be going back. It was a quiet day also and there was no rush to get the next punter in. It's just greed... I've had my full hour at their sister shop at 240c Huntingdale. So go there if you have the option.

 47 Viewpoint Ave, Glen Waverley - Maggie
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Maggie

Establishment : 47 Viewpoint Ave

Date of Visit : 07/01/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 03 9560 3789

Hours of Business :

Rates : 30mins / $50

Age : 30ish

Size/shape : 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, if you're looking for a decent hard massage with a happy ending.

My experience/comments : Decided to give this place a try seeing as it was on my way home from work.

Called up and found Maggie was available and made a booking for 30 mins.

Arrived and was greeted by the receptionist (who I thought was going to take my booking) who dealt with all the financials and led me into the room, leaving me to get changed etc etc.

I must admit that I was disappointed when Maggie walked in (would've rather had the receptionist based on looks).

Anyway, Maggie gave a great (based on other RnT places) hard massage which was worth the price imo. After the flip, was offered a HJ for an extra $30. Left happy.

Person's Name : Helen

Establishment : 47 Viewpoint Ave

Date of Visit : 11/01/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 03 9560 3789

Hours of Business :

Rates : 30mins / $50

Age : younger than 24

Size/shape : 6 nice body from what I can see.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Not sure.. darker olive skin asian.

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Average value for money

My experience/comments : 

Decided to try this place again after bumping into Helen on the way out of my last visit (see previous post). Helen had everything I was looking for: young, slim and short-ish.

Called up and found she was busy but would be available after 30 mins.

Arrived, handled all the financials and quickly got changed in the room. I did notice that the towels might not have been changed or just flipped over from the previous booking (something I kinda noticed on my previous visit) but couldn't be sure.

Anyway, Helen was extremely quiet during the booking, giving a so so massage (ok by rnt standards in melbourne these days). Time for the flip and was offered a HJ for $30 (seems the standard price here). No touching was allowed although I suspect more might be on offer on subsequent visits (not yet confirmed as the towel thing has turned me off for now).

I have never had a problem with towels here but I always ask to make sure.

I have also never had a problem with time but then I rarely watch the clock. The last time I was with Maggie, she was the one asking me "what time did we start?".

I think it depends who she talks to, what mood she is in and the story changes. 

She told me she hasn't even got a boyfriend and she couldn't possibly do HJs if she had one! She told another punter that she is from Korea (she is definitely Chinese).

carbon copy of my experiences, right down to the $40
i know she is overcharging me, but because i enjoy her company and general chit chat it does not overly bother me
also she has always given me the  "aged 24, single. no b/f or husband , from Taiwan story" and this has been consistent over around 5 or 6 sessions

i agree services limited to hj

 Viewpoint under new management
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Emily

Establishment : 47 Viewpoint Ave

Date of Visit : 04/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0410999007

Hours of Business : 11:00-7:00

Rates : 30mins / $50

Age : 21-25

Size/shape : 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, if you want just a massage + HJ

My experience/comments : This place is now under new ownership so the girls reviewed earlier in this thread are no longer there.

I arrived just after 11:00 at the same time as a very cute Chinese girl who was opening the shop. This gave me the opportunity to have a bit of a chat to make sure that the place wasn't completely legit and that similar services were offered as by the previous owners. I was told by Emily that she didn't do nude but a happy ending was available ($30 extra). I decided just on 30 mins as I hadn't seen her before.

The room was nice and clean, nothing left over from the previous day, but I was the first customer so I would expect that. She started a nice massage on my back and legs but unfortunately, no "accidental" touches or flicks. In fact there was really no build-up at all. On the flip, she allowed me to touch her legs while she applied more oil and started a regulation slow tug. Eventually, the desired result was achieved but it wasn't one which I would call memorable.

She told me that they have a few parlours around Melbourne, specifically mentioning Oakleigh, Caulfield and Camberwell and that the girls swap among the shops. On the way out, I noticed another girl who was at least as good looking if not better.

WIR? Both of the girls I saw were cute, young and very good looking so I may return and try someone else.

Person's Name : Ivy

Establishment : Japan Relaxation and Massage -  47 Viewpoint Ave, Glen Waverley - 0410 999 007

Date of Visit : This arvo

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :

Hours of Business : 11am onwards

Rates : $50/$55/$65 30mins/45mins/1 hr + $30-$40 HJ

Age : late 20s

Size/shape : Medium about 5'6''

Nationality or Ethnicity : Taiwanese

Services Provided : Massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : I was on my way and on an impulse got in here today. There was a 5 minute wait only one punter in and 
two masseuse but one (Rita) wanted a break so waited on Ivy. Their massage prices for 45 mins and an hour has come down. The price 
difference doesn't make sense but whatever. She ushered me in, Room was warm and comfortable, not the cleanest but I've seen worse.
She asked me Soft or medium and I opted for the former. Massage wasn't anything to write about just hands moving around randomly
She left the neck, face, head alone. Didn't go anywhere near the crack or the sac. Stayed well away from brother down there. I was
thinking no hope here. I asked her if I could touch her and she said no and stepped back so I didn't bother.
Now on the flip, she put a towel on brother and I said I didn't want one. She takes it off and goes on to do a very mediocre massage
left shoulder, chest and stomach alone. Then she asks me to wait and gets a tub of warm water and towel. Just before she starts to 
wipe me down, I ask her if there is a happy ending and she says yes but asks for a $40 tip. I said okay if the clothes come off. She 
says no and comes down to $30. I say okay then top comes off and she says no. So I say $20 and she says no. In that case, I get up and 
dress myself. So sorry guys no report on the hj. The news is HJ is available. I'm thinking Rita may do it better. Perhaps next time.
So I spent $55 for 45 minutes and walked out in a neutral state.

Same girl Ivy (see above). Managed to get an HJ for $20. I would rate the HJ as a 4/10. It wasn't hurried. She tried a lot however, I just think it was too mechanical. Kept looking down at Mr. Happy and for some reason, kept wanking as you would shake a coke bottle ie. thumb on the nozzle so to speak (ouch!). Had to guide her and reached completion. All in all not bad $55 for 45 and $20 but probably wouldn't return anymore. Have had enough of Viewpoint for now.

Person's Name: Eva then Emily

Establishment: Viewpoint

Date of Visit: April 2013

Rates: $50/30

Age: both mid 20's

Size/shape: slim

Nationality or Ethnicity: both Taiwanese

Services Provided: Tug

Value for money/recommend?: just ok

My experience/comments: 

Found out through the grapevine that this place had reopened again under new management and with all different girls. This place is part of a chain that also has a few other stores in the south east.

Rolled up on my lunch break, spoke to the very attractive receptionist Eva and requested a 30 minute session to see how things have changed here. Eva took me to the back room and left me to get my kit off. She then returns a short time later and we get started with a hard massage. Eva is a 25 y/o Taiwanese who is a qualified physiotherapist back home. She has the prettiest face i have seen at a RnT place thus far. I would rate her massage as being very thorough as she addressed every possible area. In saying that... it still wasn't as good as my regular girl who gives a painful rough massage that I love. Eva's English was passable and we talked a bit about sport, travel etc... I could sense we were way over time so i requested the flip myself. She then went to work on my chest, stomach, thighs and shins. She could tell I was getting edgy so she then asks if there's anything else i'd like. I respond with "yes, please". She then informs me that she doesn't do any extra services and will get a sexy girl to help me out. I'm a little disappointed as Eva is so hot. I haven't had this happen to me before...so I kick back and wait for Emily to remove the green vest and be subbed into the game. Emily comes in and she is a very cute young looking 24 y/o Taiwanese wearing a short denim shirt, stockings and Doc Marten boots. She informs me that she was half way through eating her lunch when she got the SOS. She asks for a pineapple to finish the job. I counter with "fine...as long as you are nude". She declines my offer. I then offer a brick and bluebird for the tug. She declines at first. We go back and forth a few times and in my mind I was happy to walk if she didn't accept my offer. She eventually accepts a brick and bluebird and gets to work. I ask to touch her all over and she tells me "2 bricks"(well, she didn't actually use those exact words). Apparently touching on top of clothes is as far as she goes. Her tug technique is quite good using both hands but in my mind I know I'm missing the extra service that I used to get from a few girls at this place. Luckily most of those girls are still working at another shop not too far away. We finish up and she returns with a warm towel and hands it to me to wipe myself down.

The overall experience was ok. I only paid for 30min but was in there for just shy of 60min. I'll probably give this place a couple more tries as there will be different girls working there most days.

Rates: $50/30

Age: 30

Size/shape: sunny slim, Kiki short 

Nationality or Ethnicity: both Taiwanese

Services Provided: Tug

Value for money/recommend?: money down the drain

My experience/comments: 

 I used to frequent this place a bit before it changed owners a few months back. A PP post I read this morning got me thinking about paying a visit again. My last attempt here was poor but thought I’d give it another go to see if the service had improved. 

Rolled up and met Sunny at the front desk. Tall stunning Taiwanese but looks Korean. I guessed her age at 22 but she’s actually 30. Sunny took me to the middle room which was already toasty warm and had an electric blanket on the table under the towel which makes jr burger go to sleep. Sunny begins a very slow firm massage. She’s only been massaging 2 months… and it shows. Her English skills are also non existent so I gave up any hope of a conversation with this hottie early on. She went through her routine on my back, then left the room and came back with warm wet towels to wash the oil off before telling me we’'d finished. I popped the question, but got denied again. I honestly thought i would be ok with her considering her age. She then fetched another girl to finish the messy work. In comes “Tattoo” from fantasy island…....... actually her name was Kiki and she was barely taller than the massage table, with very average looks. I offer a brick & bluebird for the HJ (should have really walked out when I think back), she accepts and gets to work using a two handed technique. I requested her to increase the grip tightness as this was going nowhere fast. She altered her technique and brought me home nicely. Money down the drain and 2nd worst punt to date.

I’'ll maybe give this place one more try because of the proximity factor. I can already cross these 2 girls plus Eva/Emily from my last visit off my list. I really need the balls next time here to ask at the desk if the girls do extras to avoid these dud punts.

Viewpoint Massage - December 2013 - Mary Cheap Punt from a Hot Milf


A bit further out than I usually like to travel, but with too many good reviews of this place & being in need of a punt I had to cross this place off my bucket list. Rainy weather be damned! I ring up previously to book an appointment with Mary. Lucky I did so as when I went in, another punter was in the reception area trying to get a booking without an appointment. Mary was on reception, & I thought she looked considerably older than 21-25 as reviewed previously, but despite having done a few clicks the body looked in pretty good nick so I sneakily grabbed a discount card from the counter, so i paid $50 dollars for 45 minutes. After being led to the room, I was pleasantly suprised about the room itself. While far from being luxurious, they'd obviously put some effort into creating a bit of ambiance in the room, with nice fabric covering


 the table topped with clean towels. Soothing western music was also playing, as opposed to the annoying tacky chinese music you typically hear in most AMP's. I nuded up, left a pineapple sitting on the stool very obviously.  Mary came in, & gave me a soft relaxing massage. She didn't shy away from me touching like a relaxed octopus touching over clothing, but the table was too low to make for optimal touching. On the 20 min mark she asked me to flip. I asked to massage her in return for the pineapple sitting on the stool, to which she quickly agreed. While throughout the massage conversation was strained due to her english being poor, she understood all the essential things perfectly.   She strips off to reveal a wonderful body that girls 10-15 years her junior would be jealous of. Tight cute butt, nice B cups & a pretty full bush. She lies down on her stomach while I kiss her neck & down her back, groping her butt, tits & lightly petting the cat at the same time. I turn her over & begin to snack on her enlarged nipples, which are like candy I could snack on all day. I finally move down & dine at the Y - & whilst I did my best I like doing so on girls fully shaven or at least neatly trimmed. Finally time for the Hj finish - a rather unskilled, rushed jackhammer job which is amongst the worst ive had in awhile. A quick cleanup & I'm on my merry way. WIR? As soon as I can afford to! Crappy Hj aside, I'd probably put her body (neck down) amongst my top 10 hottest Amp bodies I've seen. Not to mention getting a 45 min massage with nude, daty & hj for $100 from a hot milf, this punt would have to be close to the top as far as Value For Money is concerned.

I get my hair cut at the place a few shops down from this R&T joint and for about 3-4 hours undercover detectives were scoping out the place.

The tip off - incredibly obvious car. Second tip off - when the shop was closing, they drove around the back which is sort of like an alley way.

I was told they were parked out on the street for about 2 hours before I was there and only moved once. 


You can almost always spot undercover police. The Holden Omega + 50 million antennas + two people sitting in car for unusual extended time = obvious. They never did leave the car though (from what I was told and saw), so my uneducated police work guess would be them just getting an idea about the amount of business they get? Surely they can't judge the people going into the shop as means for further investigation :\

I'll keep this page updated if I know more. Got my friend telling me the updates because she is so curious. She thinks it's a full blown brothel...I innocently was "ignorant" to the situation and agreed

My understanding of this shop from the reviews is they are quite disciplined in what they let customers get away with.  About a year ago I saw a girl here who let me go to far.  She was really desperate for money and stripped nude and she jerked me off in the 69 position as I licked her out.  This girl had glasses and spoke fairly good English, her working name was coco.  I had her in doggy style and was rubbing my penis up against her puddy.  I started jerking off and blew over my hand, as it was about to go onto the floor.  Coco replied with "kinky".. The next time we did a straight massage and she offered to give me a private in her unit.   She told me we can do anything.  She gave me her number and a week later I arranged to meet her at the unit in clayton.  She took about 3 hours to respond and she didn't sound totally at ease.   I arrived at the flats on night and there the older style run down flats, so I figured gee this girl is really struggling.  The lights were on in  her flat, but she refused to open the door.  I rang her later and she said she was sick.  The truth is she just didn't trust me.   This is the only situation where a girl has gone too far at viewpoint massage that I know of.  From all the reviews ive read on this place, no girl has done a nude massage here.

Wouldn't be surprised if they follow a punter after his leaving and pull him over a few blocks away. Ask a lot of questions of him and offer to not drag him through the courts as a witness for the prosecution if he gives details of service offered, price and how the conversation went to arrange it. Must however be contained in a formal statement given back at the house of uniforms. If they get enough of these they make a brief and use it to have a Magistrate issue a warrant for Mamasan/Papasan and then start the plea bargain process.
Happened to me once leaving a R&T place in the inner western suburbs when we had state government and many local governments in labour hands directing valuable resources towards stamping out R&T establishments rather than addressing drug related break-ins and women and children being abused by delinquents (yes I am a cynic).
Anyways, after 5 minutes of the text book, good cop bad cop routine, straight out of the Academy manual and being delivered by two of its recent graduates I suggested they arrest me and let me have my day in court where my beak and I could test their oh so incriminating evidence. FMD, red faces and confusion on their part all around and I was off and on my merry way.

 Japan Relaxation and Natural Therapy - August 2014
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Serena

Establishment : Japan Relaxation and Natural Therapy

Date of Visit : 26/08/14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Japan Relaxation and Natural Therapy, Glen Waverley Melbourne - Massage

Hours of Business : I didn't pay that much attention but I think it's 10am - 8pm

Rates : $55 for 45 minutes

Age : mid to late 20s

Size/shape : Size 12 athletic

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese I think

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : The massage was decent and not over the top pricey.  In terms of extras not so.  Might try another ML before writing this place off.

My experience/comments : This review is posted elsewhere on the wide web.

I'm finally back after quite a while off crook as a dog.  I read a review of this place from another forum.


Anyhow I was passing through the area doing an errand for work when I decided to drop in after earlier reading a review of this place.  It was mid afternoon and no parking available outside so ended up parking quite a ways up the road and legging it.  I walked in and met Serena sitting behind the counter listening to headphones.  She advises she's the only ML currently available.  I attempt to book for an hour but she's got an upcoming booking so could only do a 45 minute booking.  She leads me into a room then leaves me to strip off and hop on the table.  She returns shortly after and asks my name and I ask hers.  She didn't seem to be keen to chat much possibly due to her broken english. She begins a firm massage with lots of pressure on my back and down the back of the legs with occasional brushing of the tackle so I thought bingo.  On the flip I inquire bout extras and she first doesn't understand then says she doesn't do that.  The front massage was still decent even expecting no relief though she no longer brushed past the tackle.  I just laid back and enjoyed it while admiring her decent bust and firm butt under the black singlet and skin tight jeans  After the massage she wiped me down with a hot towel and I dressed and went on my way blue balls and all.


WIR - maybe, not to see Serena no matter how cute and attractive she looks but might turn up later in the day and give the place another go with another ML.

Originally that's what I thought they would do. Although they literally had three people sitting in the car for 2+ hours. They would leave their spot, and come back..but literally in less than 2 minutes so it made you think they did not follow someone.

I haven't personally been there since I saw it last, however my friend has told me they haven't seen the under covers lately.

IMO it is quite ridiculous to have THREE people in a car scoping out an R&T shop.

Being the curious person I am, I decided to drive past after work to check the place out.

Big piece of paper saying something along the lines of "$20 for 20 minute massage - LADIES ONLY". Hehe, the cops have pressured them.

What I'm trying to say is..if you are a new customer wanting to check the place out - don't expect any extras. I think this place is dead unless you are very well known regular.

20$ for 20 mins will destroy them, and how many women will be lining up for this special.    If a girl has been giving guys a tug, it would be good for a women to massage another women just for a change, but what if the female requested the masseur starts using her nails to tease her lol.   I can imagine the masseur thinking, good god can I massage a person who isn't horny lol.

Cops raided the place. They have apparently made a few visits after the raid as well.

Looks like nothing was caught in the act (since they are still open and running), so at the moment it seems as though they are attempting to catch them in the act. This is why I would strongly advise to stay away for a while. You never know when they will be coming next, and they 100% know what the deal is with this place. I would also strongly doubt they will be offering any type of sexual service with the attention they have.

I doubt I will hear much more about the place. My friend and I have had our "curious laugh" and I've squeezed a lot of information without making it seem ridiculous weird why am I so curious

10 people with guns and vests definitely classified it as a raid 

Which, also on that note, is that actually a common thing for an R&T raid. Full guns and vests blazing..just seems WAY over the top to me. 

Even though I didn't specifically see it myself, I'm close friends with the girl who told me so she wouldn't be making anything up.

Is your information coming from a hairdresser Crazyteddy?
Might be slightly embellished perhaps? When the local detectives 
visited ( or raided if you like) Macrina St Oakleigh - it wasn't 'vests blazing'
( had to laugh at that) and it made a couple of paragraphs in the local leader newspaper.
Fully armed raid on this place surely should have gone to the prime time news? 
And we'd all know about it.

As I've said numerous times now, I am passing along information that has been given to me. 

I personally saw the undercovers carrying out their incredibly poor "stakeout" attempts, so the heat was coming. Another member on the forum told me he saw a silver van with a camera over the back door down the road. Now obviously that could be many different things. I'll keep the members name private for his / her own privacy.

I have only posted my personal opinion and advise. 


Either way, here is what we know;

- 100% eye confirmation proof of under cover police work
- 100% eye confirmation of the shop putting up a "sign" (A4 piece of paper) that states a special $$ offer for Ladies only. Ladies was in capitals.
- Verbal communication / pass along information of police raiding (or maybe surprise investigation warrant is more acceptable here?)
- Verbal communication / pass along information of EITHER police or council stopping past days in a row after the event.

^ Reason I say either is because I was told the same two men visited the premises with a VE Omega (standard cop car), photo identification and a lot of paperwork. Could be some type of council I have no idea honestly, since I did not see this with my own eyes.


Once again, take the information as you will. If people are wanting to risk visiting the place, they are more than free to. I am simply looking out for the punters and providing caution for those who may end up seeing this thread and thinking about visiting. That being said, I would doubt them offering extra services to newcomers.

EDIT: The reason why this happened? Apparently customers of the shops in the same street complained. Every business owner knew the place, and didn't care. Maybe I'm biased but that sort of frustrated me when I was told it was due to customers complaining which literally has zero effect on them.

[COLOR=#333333]Value for money/recommend?: Nope, poor value.

Comments: 
Came here around 6pm and saw Linda a pretty average looking late 20s PRC girl but I was desperate for some relief and went ahead with the massage anyway. Linda gives a pretty average massage until the end where her sensual side starts to shine through, some nice ball tickling and ass play but that's the only really noteworthy thing she did during the massage, once I got flipped she massaged me from my head so I'd get a nice view of her tits although she wasn't showing any cleavage and they weren't anything special anyway.

Once the massage is finished I have to ask for extras, Linda tells me that customers never get extras unless they ask for it so make sure you pop the question if you decide to go for a massage here, the HJ is pretty stock standard as most HJs are and the tip ended up being $30 for a clothed HJ with no touching.

WIR: No, I've found much better places that give off much better value since this visit. Btw Linda also works at 22 Mavron St in Ashwood.[/COLOR]

Services Provided: Lomi Lomi + HJ


Value for money/recommend?: Yes

Saw their ad on gumtree to called and made booking. Unfortunately I got there 5 min late. When I walked in, no one was there! Rang the bell! An old lady with sunglasses appeared and took my money for an hour and ushered me to the room next to reception! Well acoustics are not well here so so can hear what's going on in other room.The room doesn't look or smell very clean!  Then she asked me to undress, I asked her if she is going to massage me and she said yes for half an hour and for another half an hour another young girl would come in. I wanted to have lomi lomi as they had advertised. At this point I am ready to leave so I asked for my money back. She is ready to give my money back first she goes to the next room to talk to another ML, and Rachel comes out asking to wait for half an hour. I could stay that long so she swaps with older lady and I get Rachel. Sorry if I have ruined anybody's experience here, I was ready to leave and wanted to leave by now as I was anticipating not so good massage!

Anyways after all these she comes in asking me to undress and and saying that they had a walk in and I was late. Anyways she starts giving me massage. I have had a lomi lomi many times before. It is sort of lomi lomi bit no under-strokes and nothing much sensual. She kind of make accidental brushes but it wasn't a tease or sensual for me! Anyways after 40 min she gets hot towel and wipes my back and it took a bit longer than usual. Then comes the flip and she asked me if I wanted to have HJ! I said I don't like rushed to too hard, and she said she is well experienced and asked for $30. I said no and she came down to 20. I said yes and she gave me the very good HJ. Absolutely no touching and she said for $50 she would! 

Jobe done! She cleans me well! Very nice attitude and will be back!

Drop off on Sunday at 1pm, only one lady in the front desk. Asked how long and guided to the room. still 65 for 1 hr not bad.
Hadn't been there about 3 month. They added the curtains on the door and a signs said "No sexual service" on the wall.
But I don't believe that. So I took off all the clothes and naked on the bed.

The massage is good 8/10. She was not talked much, but give me a sexual massage. My bro was hard all the time.
After the flip, she asked any extra. I asked price first she replied $40 for hj. I said OK. She started slowly and then finish off me in 5min.
She did't like to be touch. Everytime my hand touch her body she just moved away. 

Anyway, when I left I said a young girl played her phone in the front desk. Maybe next time I try her skill.

Rates : 50$ 30 mins plus extra

Age : 28ish

Services Provided : hand job 

Value for money/recommend? : not too bad

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

I havent been here in a couple of years, and driving to work, i thought id check out if they had a hottie.  Older receptionist was quite confused with my request to meet a girl, then one popped her head around the cnr.  It was bloody yoyo from 435 highbury rd.  I was planning to see her on sat, and she presented in a blue wollen skirt and look  great in white shoes, so i decided to book her here.    Handed her the money and prepared for return.  When she did she told me she works here weds and fri, and has deserted 193a on middlesborough rd.  Still working highbury she said.

I requested powder, and for 3 mins she moved it into my back and legs. Then i asked to massage her,  she questioned why, then said" tips", and then i do this for money.  After some debate, we agreed on 50$ extra for handjob, with undergarments on.   Onto the table she kept her black t'shirt on, and i started rubbing her legs.  She had some sexy red shiny undies on, by far the sexiest she has ever worn.  As i massaged her, she told me she now has boyfriend.  I told her i hope he takes her away from this, and she told me " this is job", and there both happy for her to keep doing it.  

She was not keen to turn over, and it took some prompting, but when she did i noticed a pad, as she quickly pulled down her t'shirt.  I asked for her to start on me, she took off her t'shirt to reveal a large orange bra, that looked so hot, if it was edible i would have eaten it. . She grabbed the oil, and slowly rubbed my balls and penis, and turned away, so i could rub and perve on her undies covered ass.  Her skills of turning me on,always work, and i blew quite quickly with her jumping up with a smile , a great acting performance. 

After the clean up i mentioned young olivia at 193a middlesborough, and she told me olivia gone to japan, for " make face".  I had no idea what she meant, until a few hours later, felt that meant"plastic surgery".  Yoyo is expensive, i make allowances for that, as she is an every month regular, and she does it for me.

Yoyo isnt working here anymore the boss said when i popped in on weds.  Thankfully she still works at 435 highburd rd, thurs and sat.  The young girl who replaced her would have been under 25 and just a very elegantly dressed girl with leather boots, and scarf wrapped around her neck.  Only her on, indicates the massive drop off in customers here.

After my failed punt with Bridget I opted to drop into here after work as I was working down the road.  I was greeted by Joyce and paid for an hour before being lead to a room.  I'm left to strip and hop on to the table  and await her return.  On returning her commenced a decent enough massage with oil with about medium pressure although she did come across and work out a few knots in my back.  At the appointed time, she asks me to flip and begins to massage my legs when I inquire what was available.  She offered $40 for a tug or $70 for nude tug.  I only had $40 left so didn't bother trying to haggle her down and lay back to a much better tug than the one received the day prior.  She gives a slow tug with a twisting motion which feels sensational and I wasn't able to hold back.  A clean up with hot towels and I was on my way. Joyce only works weekends.

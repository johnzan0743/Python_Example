My experience/comments :

I popped into this place because I genuinely wanted a massage after being sore from sporting endeavours.  Yeah, right I hear everyone say.

However I've been here before and saw a girl called Tina who gave a firm and deep tissue massage and only a massage.  The setup is exceptionally professional and there are plenty of 'other' known RnT joints along Victoria St which I could have chosen if I was thinking along those lines, but apparently things change or maybe management did.

First sign of change was that the door was locked when I went to walk in, had to ring a bell and a more mature asian lady came out from the back.  Didn't think much of this at the time as the till/money is kept at the front counter so probably fair enough if you're away for a while to secure the area.

Sign #2, the mammasan said all girls were busy at the moment, she could get me started and they would take over when free.  Not exactly the service you would expect from a professional therapeutical masseuse.

Sign #3, I enquired as to whether Tina was working today, only to be told Tina didn't work here anymore but they had young girls, even better.  Keh, better what ???

Returned in 15, this time door was open, with a young girl sitting at the counter scoffing her KFC box lunch.  Clearly couldn't afford a boob job, so was trying the more natural albeit slower method.  Maylor (or yang, not sure ?) was dressed in denim shorts with tight white tee and bra. 

Paid for just 30 mins as I didn't know the girl, whereas if it was Tina I would have gone the 60 mins deep tissue option.

Into the room, which is very professional, fresh towels, camelia's laid on the table, incense, etc.  Nuded up and onto the table to wait.

Sign #4, Maylor returns however now she's changed tops to this loose fitting black cotton number.  Same denim shorts, but they are pulled low on the hips and when she turns I can see quite a bit of bum crack like she's a tradie, only this is a good thing and an incredible cock hardener.

Sign #5, Maylor asks (her English and understanding of answers turns out is very basic) have I seen here before and I swear I thought she was about to take even the flimsy top she was wearing off.  Foolishly I stumbled and fluffed my lines replying that no, however, I had seen Tina for a great deep tissue but this only got me a quizzical look.

Sign #6, Maylor hops up on the table on top of me on my bum and sensually starts caressing my shoulders and lower back.

Sign #7, Maylor leans forwards and presses her whole body down on top of me and starts nibbling my ear.

OK, so I finally click.  A little slow I know, a little naive, I never profess to being the sharpest tool in the box, but I get there in the end.

Maylor hops down, and continues the pretense at massage.  This time my hands wander a little, but the massage is not really doing much for me so I flip.

More caressing and I sit up to suck on what turns out to be only A cups at best.  More KFC needed in room #1.

After negotiating for a $30 tug, she hops back up cowgirl style and proceeds to apply a pretty nice, slow two handed number to completion.

WIR, probably, actually who am I kidding, yes I will because it's close by, it's much cleaner than anything else in the area and the girls are young and seemingly reasonably experienced, although I have no idea if things progress any further than RnT.

I actually prefer my RnT to be more R than T.  At least a very good rub component.  I miss Michelle from Urban Spa.  She was older and not best looker, her hands were like little hot rocks and repertoire was extensive.  

Simply haven't been able to find that combination since, so if anyone knows where she went, please, please, PM me.

Enjoy !!

Person's Name : Leah
 Establishment : Award Massage & Beauty
 Date of Visit : 23/12/2013
 Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 409 Victoria St, Abbotsford, VIC - (03) 9428 6660
 Hours of Business : 10am to 8PM
 Rates : $65 60mins
 Age : 30's 
 Size/shape : Slim 
 Nationality or Ethnicity : French (Asian)
 Services Provided : Massage only
Value for money/recommend? : Yes - but massage only

Was in need of a massage after finishing Christmas shopping so tried this place for the first time.

Leah's massage was one of the best I have had, great at getting all the knots out and very firm - bordering on painful - which is just how I like it.  Just enough oil (not like some girls who think they are trying to baste a turkey) and hot towels on the finish to clean up.

I asked if anything else was on offer but no.  

The place is very clean and I definitely return - perhaps to try another girl if I wanted more but I would see Leah again for a decent massage.

My experience/comments :

Was supposed to having a session with Cristal Hotbabe yesterday, but she cancelled on me only a few hours prior, re-scheduling for Jan.

Obviously disappointed and in somewhat of a state I started investigating other plans but as many can probably appreciate, it was hard to get excited about the short notice alternatives I was able to come up with, comparatively speaking anyhow.

I had woken that morning thinking depravity and bucket lists and was left somewhat deflated.

None of the options left available to me struck a chord so decided to just drop into Award since I was in the area to get a bite anyhow.

Met two girls in reception, one incredibly beautiful (turned out not to be a massueuse, why is that always the case ?) and the other quite tall and flat chested.  As it turned out they were breaking for dinner themselves, so I decided to do the same and return in an hour.

Returned to find the beautiful one alone (giddyup), but the carpet was yanked from under me yet again discovering she was reception only.

Had to wait a few mins for someone to be available, however, courtesy of listening into some other punter's phone call, discovered only Vietnamese girls work here.  Not sure if that was just that day or in general, but it's in keeping with the location and my previous couple of visits.

A different girl (Finn) popped her head around the corner shortly thereafter and invited me into the massage area.

Finn is short, cute, slim and B-Cupped, classic Vietnamese 

Nuded up and onto the table, Finn commenced with a firm massage, but not firm enough for mine. 

English is poor, but good enough for small talk with lots of giggles to cover lack of understanding, but that's OK.  I didn't understand half of what she said either, I should have giggled back 

No teasing or seduction during the first half, but on the flip I started to mast up just being exposed to the open air.  That and a cute Viet girl rubbing my thighs. 

A quiet hint and query resulted in a finish being negotiated for $30.

No touching was allowed and some very shy responses to my approaches (perhaps she wanted more $$ for touching ?), but at that stage I was happy to simply lie back and go with the flow.  Which I did and it was significant given my pent up condition.

Different from the gutter 'n filth I was expecting that day, obviously, but very pleasant nonetheless.

This place is always clean and the girls are slim and young if that's your thing.

It's not really mine and I like my ML's to know how to do the M bit, but the cleanliness of this place will probably keep me coming back.

Fully dressed, unfortunately.  All I was allowed to do is squeeze/rub her butt over the tights/leggings.

Not a full review as there was no sexual service involved, however, I popped into Award yesterday and thought I was on a winner when allocated a girl called May.

May has a cracking body from what you can tell fully clothed and is quite a beauty, I think she was the receptionist I encountered a few weeks back.

Disappointingly there was not a hint of anything sexual and was fully covered appropriately with a towel the whole time and she had a sweet innocence about her that is hard to see going anywhere near my level of deviency 

Massage wise though it was the equivalent of visiting a combination of Chiro/Sports Physio with elbows digging into pressure points either side of the spine to release tense muscles and then rubbing the knots out.  

Don't get me wrong, it was excellent albeit a bit painful to endure at times, which is exactly what it is like with a Physio's visit after an injury.  Clearly there was tension there, just not the type I was hoping to get released. 

I would and will see May again, but only therapeutically.  That and the forlorn wish that it was just a first visit thing.  Please, please someone tell me they have gotten further with May 

Anyhow, just thought I'd jot a note to advise who to avoid if you are after anything other than a Physio level of pain massage.

Also , I picked up a business card whilst there which lists 411 Swan St, Richmond and 204 Bell St, Heidelberg as sister establishments.  Yet to determine whether there is any cross pollination amongst these establishments.

Popped into Award yesterday afternoon to see Mai and can confirm she doesn't do extras.

She was happy to call someone else in to complete the task, so it's not as if the establishment is strictly legit, but I was happy to just let her continue.

Great massage, but if anything other than that is a necessity probably best to pick someone else

Wrong thread and who knows if it's true or not, however, upon inquiry Michelle from Urban didn't have a working Visa and may return in 10 months or so.

By my reckoning that would be around May '14.

As a wise man once said, will believe it when I fuck it

Person's Name : Mira
Establishment : Award Massage & Beauty
Date of Visit : 21/01/2014
Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 409 Victoria St, Abbotsford, VIC - (03) 9428 6660
Hours of Business : 10AM to 8PM
Rates : $40 30mins
Age : 20's 
Size/shape : Slim
Nationality or Ethnicity : Vietnamese
Services Provided : Nude RnT
Value for money/recommend? : Yes 

My experience/comments :

This place is fast becoming my one and only haunt.  

Not the cheapest by any stretch or the most expansive menu wise, however, it is clean, fresh and most importantly close to home 

Today, two girls were on Hanna & Mira. Mammasan shows me into the first room which is my favorite as the others all have an open aired roof so you can hear everything in the room next and reception.

Mira enters a few mins later, she is slim, nice smile and a bright red dyed hair.

I ask for a hard/strong massage as always, but it could probably only be described as medium at best.

Was the first time I'd been with Mira so just laid back and waited to see what would ensue.  Some nice soft strokes towards the end and a quiet whisper as to whether I wanted anything extra today.

I flipped over to present her with the obvious response, almost taking out an eye 

She offered $50 nude or $80 body slide.  Ridiculously expensive really.  I'd much rather negotiate $30 for the finish and reward with $50 for exceptional service.

I just went the $50 option, but will be haggling this down on future visits to be more in line with market prices.

To be fair, a fine slow finish was expertly delivered with light touching allowed all over.

Of course I'll be back, just anyone contemplating a visit, don't expect M&J type service.

My experience/comments : 

If you remember the legend of 99 Mt. Pleasant Rd, it was such a fantastic place with FS offering.
As I've picked up some signals it raised from ashes once again under new management, I've decided to pay a visit.

When I opened up the front door, I saw three people around. 50-60yo caucasian male which is likely the new owner and two size XXXXL girls. 
One was caucasian and the other one seemed like a shemale. 
My instinct started sending DEFCON 2 signal but proceeded anyway, curiosity killed the cat so they said.

Candice came in to the room and started "I'll rub oil on your skin and call it massage" work... I thought just leaning some of her weight on me will do more than fine massage but seems like even that is too much exercise given her panting for skin rub work. 

Hygiene standard is worse than asian places, they don't even use any disposable paper for massage table.

I saw a good feedback about this place recently on the other forum and under strong suspicion that is written by the owner. 

So I guess I can give made in Australia branding for the place given 2/3 people I saw were Aussie as well as +1 point for people with big girl fetish.
Otherwise, don't ever even think about this place...

It seems to be run by an aussie man, thus the employment of mixed girls.  It also seems this Aussie businessman has a lot to learn about the rnt game.  He's miles off.

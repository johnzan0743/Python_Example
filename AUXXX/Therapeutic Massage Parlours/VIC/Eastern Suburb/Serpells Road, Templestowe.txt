One of my friend told me that 144-150 Serpells Road is AMP. Outside it look like a mansion and each room is hugh and have mable ensuit. There are more than five massage rooms. They didn't put on the adv. Too hard to believe millions worth of mansion is a AMP in templestowe, maybe it is high class one. Any other bro try that before? Please let us know.

This place is just around the corner from me. There have been a few new advertisements in the local papers lately for new massage places so I will do some detective work this week..

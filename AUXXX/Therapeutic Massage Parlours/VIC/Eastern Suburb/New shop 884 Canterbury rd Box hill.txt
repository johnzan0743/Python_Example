Some would remember the old tracky dacks Papasan who ran the shop with older asian ladies a couple doors down from the bp near cnr Station and Canterbury rd's, this new one sits opposite the Bp on Canterbury rd. With loads of car traffic in this area, u would hope they have a back entry

Popped in here Saturday. When u walk in all u see is a beautiful white marble floor, immaculately clean inside. Very spacious reception area. Worth going in just for the detail of the shop.

This shop  now has opposition on the opposite side of the cnr Canterbury and Station st, opposite the car wash.   So when u are at the lights on Station st/canterbury rd heading towards Burwood rd, look left to see neon flashing lights, then look right to see neon flashing lights, the new shop took over the Asian real estate business.  As i drove past noticed the shop is called MASSAGE-open time, and the hours are 10am till 8pm.  Office workers are next door.

Popped in here last week, the entry is on the cnr.  Receptionist right near the door, leads u around to the right, through another door, which leads to a long 50 metre corridor, turn left massage lady busy, told her i would go, she allowed exit out the door parallel to Station st, the exit next to the roller door, just down from Aldi's.  Just the one girl on, and receptionist was not much chop either.  This shop will probably be no match for the one on the opposite side.

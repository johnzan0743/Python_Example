I went to anongs shop recently, nice little set up, had a 1hour massage with a nice thai lady, really nice set of tits on her, not sure if there was anything else on offer as i didnt ask, but she was getting rather close to the groin area, and was massaging my stomach and chest while she was standing beind me, so her tits were almost touching my face, i got hard a couple of times which she would have noticed, but there was no offer of anything else....ill keep trying... anyone else had any luck here?

Establishment : Nong Thai Massage

Date of Visit : 23-11-11

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 9781 3700 / 28A Wells St, Frankston

Hours of Business :  Mon - Sat, 9am - 6pm

Rates : $75/hr

Age : early 20's

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : 

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : Very average

My experience/comments : After reading Anong's reviews, I rang on Sat to make an appointment with her.  I booked in for 5pm Wed, as I would be closer to Frankston than I normally would be.  Still a 30min drive.  Arrived and said that I had a 5pm booking with Anong, and they told me that she is not there, that she is in Thailand.  Not only that, but no booking had been recorded.  They swore black and blue that they would have told me that Anong was away, but i know that I was very specific, and to not even have written my appointment down is weird.  They offered someone else to massage, and I was in two minds, but decided after a while that I'd take the 45min for $65.  I was shown a room and undressed and lay on the table, draped with a towel.  The young lady came in and went straight into the massage.  She did ask me if I had any areas to work on, and I said that apart from my neck, that I just wanted a relaxing massage.  I've learnt that earnest inexperience can cause more pain afterwards. She did not utter a single word or communicate after that.

It was obvious that she was very amateur, although the brief work she did on my stomach was very soothing and was the redeeming feature.  No hint of extras.  I thought that I might crack an erection to see if she might respond in any way, but I was so bored that I couldn't even make it twitch.

My thoughts:  Either you're good at massage and leave the client invigorated or relaxed, or you're average and redeem it with a stimulating experience.  Just putting it out there.

Had to try my luck after reading reviews about Anong.  She came back from Thailand last night, so I booked for 6pm this evening.  I went there yesterday and had a very average massage with a younger lady.  I told Anong that she came very highly recommended and must agree that her massage is great. Nong Thai Massage charges $75/hr. As the massage was rolling along, I asked her if for more money she would do extra massage.  She said "we only do massage here".  According to the other posts, I'm going to have to become a regular to experience Anong magic, although I do have to drive 40mins to get there.

Don't know who put that heading on my review of Anong that says balmoral st, but it was definitely the Wells St address and it was definitely Anong.

Apologies, that would have been due to a "technical"  error when I was fixing the thread. Have now removed the incorrect title.

Cheers,

Person's Name : unsure

Establishment : Nong Thai Massage 

Date of Visit : 30/11/11

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : (03) 9781 3700 

Hours of Business : unsure

Rates : 30 mins / $45 60mins / $75

Age : mid twenties

Size/shape : 8ish. small framed

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : massage

Value for money/recommend? : unsure

My experience/comments : My first time here so wasnt sure what to expect. Decent ambiance but walls are paper thin so sound travels readily. Relatively hot girl got down to business with an oil massage. Being inexperienced at this i was sure of any signals i shouldve given but ended up just being a 'straight massage'. My hard-on was fairly obvious when i turned over and she flicked my balls a few times whilst massaging the inner thigh but alas she soon finished and exited. Possibly due to another patron entering adjacent room, possibly i didnt give the right signals... or possibly I was just unlucky with the girl! Either way it wasnt a bad job of a massage so cant complain too much.

Went back yesterday at 10.30. Absolute ripping massage but no extras to speak of. A little bit confused though - In regards to another thread about private massage ladies and Anong formerly working out of Mornington but now supposedly owning this shop. I had Anong massaging me and I asked her about her prev work in mornington etc and she said that was in fact her sister who is now back in Thailand???? Pretty irrelevant really but was just curious...
As mentioned, top notch hour-long massage but no extras even after my offer of extra cash

I went a couple of times in December and got a fantastic massage both times . Unfortunately nothing else on offer at all. Offered extra money but she was out of the room as soon as time was up.

 Nantana Thai Massage - Frankston - 9783 2748
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name : Nat or Noon

Establishment : Shop Upstairs

Date of Visit : 25/01/2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 9783 2748, 28a Wells st, Frankston (used belong to Annong..called Nong Thai Massage)

Hours of Business : 10.00am to 8.00pm

Rates : $60.00hr

Age : Nat 21, Noon 45

Size/shape : Nat Slim. Noon curvy.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Both Thai

Services Provided : Thai oil massage, and if you are lucky cock massage only

Value for money/recommend? : Yes/Yes for massage.

My experience/comments : Went to see a old massage joint from the past to see it had changed hands, (Nong Thai, with Annong, as she sold and setup in Cranbourne..to be confirmed) went in and was met by a young girl called Nat, she showed me to the curtained room, off with the clothes and waited for her return. Once she returned she preceded to clean my feet with hot towels...awesome, then she started the massage, mind you she covered me with a towel, so thought oh well i came for a thai massage so enjoy it. This went on for 30 minutes before the flip, again covered with a the towel, she is really good at the Thai massage in fact i could have easily slept.I tried to make some eye contact to her and she was a little shy, i chatted about the possibility of extra massage, with a clear no, we don't do that, next minute she leaves the room. 

In comes a older lady , she says you wanted some extras, well we really do not do that, within a couple of seconds we both remember each other from another place a year ago where she and i had a moment. We talked for a few minutes whilst she continued the massage establishing what to offer, we settled on cock massage, which was just a slow and effortless stroking. This went on for a good 10 minutes but then she says time was up, so she stopped way short of me cumming, but she really wasn't doing a HJ anyway. In my opinion this place is a really legit joint with nothing much to offer in terms of extras, but that maybe different for others so i guess we await for further feedback.

I was in Prahran for an appointment and only had 30 mins so I tried this  place for the 1st time. There are a couple of places near by but this  one mentioned "4 hands" on the price list which sounded hopeful!
I  went in and the Mamasan (Mary) directed me to a room I said I was in a  hurry and she said she would look after me. Her massage was pretty OK -  sensual without crossing the line - no therapeutic value but still good.
I'd  been giving Mary all the usual hints when she strayed near the crack  but to no avail - then she leaned forward close to my head and said "you  like extras?" "hell yes" was the reply and she said she didn't do that  but would be one of the younger ladies. All good i guess however I was a  bit worried about time. Then Rose came in.
Rose had the perfect AMP  attitude - good English - lot's of eye contact that left no doubt about  the fact that naughtiness on offer - lovely tight little body - she got  to work on my crack/sack  for a couple of minutes before the flip - she  jumped up on the table between my legs and gave me a fantastic two  handed HJ while maintaining eye contact.

I'm super keen to go back for a full session!

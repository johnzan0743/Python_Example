[COLOR=#333333]Saw her ad on gumtree so decided to give her a try! Its above hair saloon so you have to enter through saloon and go upstairs. Neat room and her certificates are hanging on the wall. She seems professional and will try to up-sell her services like face-mask and body scrubs etc. I usually jump on the table with my undies on and because its hint for me to know there is more when they ask me to remove my undies.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]Jumped on it with my undies on and she asked if she could remove them as she said the oil would get into them!Good sign and she give good massage! Bit too chatty for my liking but good massage and she is friendly!! Not accidental touches or anything sensual!! She flipped and gave me good massage!! Anyways I popped the question and she said she does it only for regular once she is comfortable with!! When I went there she had special price for a month that was $55/Hr, and asked if I could extend her and she said how much I had!! I said $80 and she said she can do for extra $80!! I said yes and they realised the mistake that I am paying too much for 15 min and in those 15 min she spent nearly 10 min giving me wipe down with a hot towel! It was good massage so thought what the hell!!

So after 2 weeks I booked again and asked if we could do exchange massage!! She said yes and would cost $80! So I though $55  for and hour of massage and half an hour of me massaging her!! Nope!! After giving me massage for half an hour she said her turn! So asked her about just giving message and she said she is is tired and she wanted to have massage!! Again what the hell!! She got down to her panties and laid on the table and gave her massage!! Gave her massage for over 45 min and touched her boobs a few times about 'No-Go Zone' around her goods. During massage she asked me how much I make and I should be there every week. When I told her I really can't spend $80 on massage every week she seemed to be a bit turned off and kept herself at distant!! YMMV! 

Nice massage and hopefully you have a great one!!

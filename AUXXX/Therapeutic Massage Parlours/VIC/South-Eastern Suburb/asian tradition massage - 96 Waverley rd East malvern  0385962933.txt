404 - File or directory not found.

Basically just taking a look on Backpage to kill sometime and found this add, address seems to be next to the Mc Donalds just up from Cnr Waverley and Burke rd. They will have opposition from 196 Waverley rd too.

I popped in here this morning around 11am out of curiosity.   I once did my washing opposite the shop, that has the firefighters to the right, and Mcdonalds to the left, and a cafe basically opposite too.  This is not a soft entry guys, serious foot traffic.  The shop is small, one asian girl standing at reception, long tight figure hugging black dress, maybe mid 20's not bad looking, she takes me to a small room, where i notice another asian girl with a black dress, sitting in a small 4 by 1 metre room resting.  2 rooms one with great natural light the other darker, with throw away sheets over top.   Other girl i met too, with glasses ok looking.   The vibe i got here was, it would take a lot of messing around financially to get those clothes off, had no real plan to stay anyways, was just curious.  Overall a very small, new and very basic massage shop that has added more unnecessary temptation.

This shop is coming back to life as a Thai massage shop.  The firefighters next door need a shop to relieve there muscular bodies.

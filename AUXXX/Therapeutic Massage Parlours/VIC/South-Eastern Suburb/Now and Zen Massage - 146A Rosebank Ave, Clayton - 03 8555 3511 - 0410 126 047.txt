Rachel - 20th April 2012

Tried upstairs at Rosebank Ave today with Rachel. I believe this place is linked to Urban Spa in Bentleigh, as they both advertise together in the leader! The place doesn't look inviting, or that clean. It's run by Indians. Rachel looks Indian very dark skin, nice enough body with her clothes on. She left me to get changed then left a towel to cover me. When she started she put the towel in-between my legs covering my bum crack. I assumed nothing more was going to happen at this point. Asked for deep tissue massage and it was more like a relaxation massage. Her hands weren't that soft. With the construction noise outside and the birds walking on the roof, you could hear lot's of noises. The music playing was too soft I could barely hear anything else bar the outside noises. She didn't ask me any questions, in fact she didn't talk at all! I asked her her name that's all I heard for 45 mins! When she stood behind my head and rubbed her hands from my neck to my bum it felt very nice, but that was about as sensual as it got! 

On roll over she rubbed her hands over my chest then did my legs only up to my knees. I looked at her to see if anything else is on offer, she looks at me. Says nothing at all. I didn't bother to ask if anything else was on offer. At around 40mins she said that time was over. The oil wasn't wiped off at all and I was left really sticky driving home. Total cost was $65 for 45 mins which seems really steep when I got nothing else! I think I will stick to brothels and places where I know what I will get. If you need to pay that much for a average massage and then need to go somewhere else it gets expensive.

Will not return here! Wouldn't recommend the place at all.

There was an Indian man at the desk when I left and the Indian girl I stayed when I arrived. The actual place is absolute shit. I couldn't relax at all with the noises. Putting the towel in-between my arse crack took the cake! What a joke. First time for everything. The massage was just ok. If I want just a massage Holiday Calm is better value and cleaner for only $50 an hour.

I called in here during the week and met Issabella. Shes very coy about just about everything. Simple questions such as where are you from gets a long convoluted response. There was alot of fish about the HJ. The massage was average and the ending not much better. I wouldnt return. But i think its worth going just the once to see the grimy greasy oil smeared walls and doors. 

Incidentally, afterwards i went to the fish n chip shop several doors up for a kebab - as you do. While i was waiting for my order to be filled the plastic cover from a ceiling light fitting crashed to the floor about one foot away from me. The tacky bit of tape that was holding it in place was still stuck to the ceiling.

Been here a few times in the past few weeks. Stayed with Ruby, a curvy Cuban milf who seems cold and mechanical until you flip over, then becomes very flirty and offers bbbj/fs for $50. Not a bad deal. Not the best looker but service is decent. 

Stayed with Emily but I think I've been turned off her. She gave a great bbbj but as I fucked her I could smell her cunt which smelt like dead fish. Also she was having her period and my cock was coveted in blood. Wont be seeing her for a while...

Person's Name : Ruby

Establishment : 146a Rosebank

Date of Visit : 13/06/2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : AS above

Hours of Business : 10am till 8 (I think)

Rates : $75 an hour

Age : 30 ish

Size/shape : DD cup, Solid

Nationality or Ethnicity : Cuban

Services Provided : BBBJ, HJ, CIM (Does do FS, I didn't this time) +50

Value for money/recommend? : Fuck yes!

My experience/comments :

Been there for Ruby a few weeks before, felt like I needed some "relaxation"

Went upstairs, greeted by Ruby. 1/2 hour please and told strip and on the bed.

Massage was fantastic, but I wanted that and more so I upped to 1 hour. Extra $20.

she started getting flirty by rubbing her tits on my head so I looked up. Got an eye full so I reached up and played with them. Asked her to strip, she asked "tips?" I said yes and off they got. 

Ruby is no great looker, definitely on the chubby side but huge firm tits. She has a warm, Latino nature. From this point the massage continued but got very flirty. Fingernail scratches, scrote scratching etc.

On the flip and she started all in. She grabbed the old fella and asked what I wanted to do with it. I replied it felt great in her mouth and pussy last time so she starts this kiss and lick all over my body. Incredible turn on. Sucks on my balls and licks along my dick. This goes on for a few minutes then she starts what has to be one of the top 3 BBBJ's I've ever had. I wanted FS but could not resist popping in her mouth.

Still have about 15 minutes left so she asks "More massage?". Not rushed out the door, no thanks but why are you still here. More massage on legs and head/neck.

Wipe down shower and gave her the "tip".

What a great day.

Would I be back, oh yeah.

They say you should never meet your heroes as you will be disappointed.Unfortunately shagging Ruby is a similar experience.I tried it earlier this year thinking that if the blow job is good then the sex must be great.All I can say is what a disappointment she was but if you stick with her oral you won't go wrong.

Hey, I had the same experience yesterday and was a bit pissed off. The ad said African Experience with Petra, but the number was disconnected.  I found another ad for the same establishment, so I rang and Petra answered.  I asked for the next appointment and she said 12.30, I said ok, and then she said, we will see you at 12pm.  I said which is it 12 or 12.30, she said I can do 12pm.  I said ok, book me in, I am on the way as it will take me 30 minutes to drive there.At about 11.45, driving along Dandy Rd, I get a call and its Petra.  Sorry Mike, can you come at 1pm,  I have double booked.  I said, I am on the way and not too far off, she apologised and said what about Manny.  Feeling horny, I said, ok book me in.  I get there and here is Petra and the mamasan (she looked South American as did Petra) Sorry Mike about the mix up can you wait an hour. I said what about Manny, oh, she is already seeing some one else.  Boy was I pissed off. (BTW, Petra was hot, not African, but a nice caramel colour, and a nice body).

I wouldn't have even waited the 20 minutes.If they are rude enough to double book you,then they don't deserve your money.If you wait it tells them that they can keep doing it and getting away with it.If it happens to me,I turn around and walk straight out and make sure that whoever is running the joint knows all about it.In this instance,you should have rung Urban Spa,asked for Nicki and told her what had happened.If you say nothing,don't be surprised if you keep getting the same shit service.

My experience/comments :
Hi Guys,
Well here I am back for more (looks like I'm addicted :-) haha).
Saw this place on locanto and they had an indian girl on the add. Never had one before so I thought I'd go and check it out.
Rolled up there and its in a strip of shops. Was cold and raining and it was evening so it was getting dark so no problem in seeking in without too much notice.
The place is upstairs and you get to a door and have to ring a bell. Opens the door and there is a smiling asian girl cute and bubbly.
She show me in and asks who I would like to see. The Indian girl was busy (dam it, look like I have to go back!!) but there was a chinese girl and the bright bubbly girl that greeted me. She looked cute and chatty (I like to interact) so I picked her.
She showed me to the room asked me to undress and lay face down. room was warm and looked clean. She wanders in a few minutes later and starts to rub me down and giggle (this I like). She jumps up on the table and straddles me (This is a good sign) So I ask if she does nude also and she agrees. She strips off and then gets back on top me face down. She rubs her pussy into my back and butt (I think she is getting wet :-)), leans over and whispers into my ear, deep breath and tongue flick (mhhmmm).
I ask if I can massage her and she says ok, so we switch and she complement me on my technique (nice touch). She hold my cock as I massage her and she has a nice stroke. I ask her to roll over and massage her front. I then kiss her around the stomach and she starts to make some noise, so I think time to eat 
I get some DATY and she seems to love every minute of it nice and juicy pussy. After she cums she smiles and says its my turn. She asks me to sit on the edge of the table and she kneels down and sucks me off. She is dam good at it I must say as she deep thoughts the whole lot!!
She take my load and then smiles spits it into a tissue and says look no mess!! (what a trooper, she likes to clean up). She wipes me down and finishes off my massage. She then dissapears for a moment and come back with warm water and cloth to wash the oil from me.
All in all I think she was nice I like her personality and I like her naughty comments. I'll go back and try again!!
Only 1 negative there was a TV in the room that had a camera pointing down the stair (security?). But I didn't really waste to much time looking at that. I was too busy!!
Cheers..

Hi fellas
I called this place yesterday Tuesday July 23, took a while to answer. Eventually Petra answered. She claimed they were closed yesterday, and will be "re-opening" tomorrow (today, Wednesday). According to her all new girls, I asked about Emily when she asked me who I normally see. She said Emily no longer works for them.
I find it all rather strange, I know for a fact that Emily and the lady that owned this joint, and urban, had a very good relationship, it appeared they were quite close. Emily even accompanied the owner on QLD holidays a couple of times.

I went there a few weeks ago and called to arrange a massage with Katie, the Italian girl, she quoted me $50 over the phone for 30 minutes. I arrived there and met Katie, average looking, not what I was hoping for, she asked for $60 for the 30 minute massage, I referred to the phone quote of $50 but she said it was $60, Petra and some older Indian lady were there, I could'nt be fucked arguing so I paid the $60. Went for 30 minute massage she was a very good masseur but no hint of extras and she left the room fairly quick when she finished. Funny thing happened, I was half way through getting changed and Petra walks in for a chat. She told me that Katie said i was very tight in the back and shoulders and she could take care of it if I wanted to come back. I thanked her and told her I might do that. Fat fucken chance of that happening. $60 for 30 minutes, Holiday Calm $55 for one hour, do the math.

I just saw this ad on locanto, and after doing about 2 minutes of digging, I found that this ad is for Rosebank, does it mean that the all time favourite is back, or is it someone else going by the same name?

She moved from Urban Spa to this joint, then left when Petra took it over. This one and Urban had the same owner, hence Emily would be at either one randomly, but since they both got sold, she disappeared, and I lost her number too. 

I'm not gonna take the risk on a dud punt based on a name that is familiar. I will however see if I can get any info via the phone.

I spoke to her a couple of weeks ago and she indicated that she was now in Qld permanently. although I guess things may have changed (such is the nature of this industry) or maybe she is making a "special guest appearance"

Nationality or Ethnicity : Italian. 

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : No.

My experience/comments :

Went and had a massage from Kati on Sat. When I saw her, I thought she was really cute and I must ask for a HJ. 
She offered me 30 mins for $60. Bit expensive but I thought it might be worth it. She did a very good job of a massage, no brushing on the tackle, but I thought I would ask anyway. I waited for the flip so I could ask her for a HJ. But there was no flip! As soon as the massage was over she was out the door. I am assuming this place has gone legit and will not be returning.

WIR: No.

Person's Name : Kati

Establishment : Zen Massage

Date of Visit : Jan 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 146a Rosebank ave Westall, Vic.

Hours of Business : 10am till 8pm

Rates : $90 for 60min

Age : late 30's early 40's?

Size/shape : 10 or 12, short, not too bad looking 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Italian

Services Provided : Massage only

Value for money/recommend? : Not really...

Thought I'd give this place a try given its refurbishment. Rocked up and was greated by Kati who was on reception duties, was told to get undressed and lie on the table. The place looks nicer now but the bathroom and showers are still dingy. 

Not sure what to expect so I nuded up and laid down. I saw a couple of other masseurs in matching shirts and thought that was a bad sign - looks a bit legit. Anyway Kati came in and started massaging - not a bad massage, typical therapautic/deep tissue. Apparently she's from Italy and only been here for a couple of years, she looks ok - good enough that I think me looking at her will keep me hard. Anyway time to flip, bad sign #2 - she put a towel over my groin. I complained that it was too hot (which it was) so she put a smaller tower over my cock and opened the door (?!) to "let fresh air in". I was a bit perplexed and thought there's no way in hell I'd be getting anything now. And I was right - all legit massage, in the last 10 min she got me to sit up so she can massage my shoulders and neck; of course my little towel falls off so I'm kinda worried about everyone out front being able to see my junk. Massage ended, was given some water, got dressed and left. 

WIR? Doubt it. Kati was nice and ok to look at, but at $90 an hour its an expensive regular massage. 

146A ROSEBANK AVE CLAYTON SOUTH, Clayton South

By the way Kati is the one second from the left. There was also a young redheaded lass that looked nice, but I doubt much is on offer here.

Person's Name : Bella

Establishment : Zen Massage

Date of Visit : May 2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 146a Rosebank ave Westall, Vic.

Hours of Business : 10am till 8pm

Rates : $100 for 60min, extra $50

Age : late 20's early 30's

Size/shape : 10, short, red hair

Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie

Services Provided : HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Fun, but exxxxy!

Rang this place for an update and sounds like they've got some new blood. Also saw an advert in Locanto featuring a young looking lass named Bianca so thought I'd give them a try again. Rocked up, was met by Bella who advised that she was the only one available. Seems like Julie is now the new owner of the place. Bella only does Lomi Lomi for $100 p/her - took her up on the offer and laid naked on the bed. Bella's lomi was pretty good, lots of teasing strokes against the frank and beans, very sensual, but not as good as Nat from Pozitiva. flipped at the 40min mark and things started hotting up, lots of direct brushes against my now hard cock, and me letting Bella know how much I'm liking it. She also started making comments which suggests extras were on offer; I asked and she only does HJ @ $50. No budging on the price either! But I was horny and she was egging me on so I agreed to it. What followed was a fun experience - she talked dirty alot and made alot of suggestive comments, while I roamed under her pants and shirt for a feel. She has a nice arse - very pliable - but her HJ technique was a bit wanting (I bit too "jackhammerish". In the end she got me across the line. Got to use their dingy showers to clean up.

WIR? Not sure. Whilst it was a fun experience, it was not cheap...for anther $10-$20 I would be getting nude HJ from a gorgeous euro babe @ Tokyo Milk. But there's something about Bella that might draw me back...

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 146a Rosebank ave Westall, Vic.

Hours of Business : 10am till 10pm

Rates : $80 for 60min

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : 6, short, red hair

Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : ok for a massage

Thought I'd give the cute redhead, Bianca, a try at N&Z massage. Booked for an hour of "sensual" relexation massage. Rocked up, was greeted by Bianca at reception, paid and laid naked on table. Bianca returned and gave me a pretty good relaxation massage - but clearly avoided the nether regions. Her massage style is not bad - decent pressure, but seem to concentrate on the same are a bit too long (i.e. my back wasn't massaged much at all). Time for the flip, towel over my groin - not looking good. Asked straight out if she does extras, got a polite "no sorry!" response. Spent the rest of the hour enjoying her massage and relaxing. 

WIR? Nope - her massage is decent but there's plenty out there who can do better for cheaper, and with the prospects of extras.

Full body relaxation. Come down and see us at our beautiful warm establishment with relaxing music. we have eftpos and showers available open until 7:00 pm tonight. Call us on 0410126047 or 85553511 


This is one of many ads found by a Locanto search for ROSEBANK all  with the same street address.

I'd say that Now&Zen is a catch line rather than the business name.

Silver members will note that this business is named "Awakening Spirit" and it looks like the phone has changed.

This place was closed down probably a year to 18 months ago.  I have a feellng this is not the first time this has happened under that ownership. Same owners seemed to also attract a lot of unwanted attention @ their Centre Road shop, which I think was also closed, but may have reopened under different ownership - but not totally sure that is the case.
New owners (of Rosebank)  of recent times, but have the distinct impression extras not on the menu, probably due to its previous history.

Rates : $100 for 60min

Size/shape : 16short, plum



Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie



Services Provided : R & T



Value for money/recommend? not sure

I walked in the other day at 10 in the morning hoping that bella would be available! but no luck, so I thought I'll get julie coz I've seen her few times over the years before but she said that she isn't working that day and Brianna does a killer massage!! 

look wise Brianna is a 5!! but I was desperate and said ok!! so she led me to the room and asked me to lie naked on the table, so that the good boy I am got into my birthday suit and waited for her butt naked on the table!! she came back and poured half a bottle of oil on my back and stated the massage!!

to my suprise it was a great Lomi lomi massage!! long flowing strokes over and under my body, lots of bum and crack play!! sliding her hands under my tummy and between my legs and giving some attention to mini me at the same time!! I was in heaven!!  

so after about 30mnts she got me to roll over and gave me her price list!! $50 for the topless tug, $70 for the nude tug and $100 for the nude tug with body slides!! I felt like asking if she was nuts but didn't wanna ruin both our moods so agreed on a nude tug for $50 cos that's all I had in my wallet!! just after she took her clothes off I thought should have just gone for the topless tug!! coz she was too big for my liking, don't get me wrong I do like curvier chicks but Brianna was bit too big!! anyways it was a great massage and a tug!! but when you add her looks into the equation I think it's bit too expensive!!

I would go back and see Brianna for a great massage and a clothed tug!!

Value for money/recommend? : WIR maybe to see what others are like. YMMV

My experience/comments : After driving home around ten I say that they still had their sign outside so I decided to see if I could have a quick massage. Went greeted I was told I could have 30 mins or an hour either relaxing or lumi lumi. I decided I wanted the lumi lumi and was taken to the room that they set up for this. I stripped off and waited for the lady to come in and after about 10 mins Ruby came in

She was very chatty and proceeded to apply loads of oil which was slightly cold but thank goodness her hands were warm. The massage itself was light and certainly wasn't a lumi lumi massage which is a bit of a shame.

After about ten mins she realised what the time was so got me to flip over saying that they shouldn't have taken me as a late booking and said it wasn't my fault. It was funny as she got close to the meat and two veg but didn't ask the question as it was my first time with her. Iwasn't that fussed either way but wouldn't have said no if she did ask.

Just a quick run down of the girls that work here:

Bella - does lomi, topless HJ for $70 extra, Nice bod, flirty.
Brianna - as reviewed before - overweight, topless HJ for $50, decent service if you like em big.
Bianca - does relaxation massage, no extras, boring as hell.
May - does lomi, personally I found her personality very cold - apparently she's very popular as she is attactive - blonde, slim, young. 
Julie - still sees clients once in a while, mature lady with a nice set of tits. topless HJ for $70 if I recall correctly. Her daughter also works at this joint...I forgot the daughter's name but got a massage from her last month - no extras. Kinda dropped hints to what her mother offered but didn't want to cause a shitstorm...LOL

TBH if you're after a good lomi go see Nat @ Pozitiva - it's only $80 and she does the best lomi that I've had so far in Melb.

May is a knockout - absolutely gorgeous- nice big tits and very good technique- sorry I didn't rate when I saw hear (about 6 months ago) - I agree with Ipdaily - she is a bit cold - call it professional distance.
I tried to get extras (on two visits) but it seemed to me this was just not on. A real pity!
I did get a clothed HR from Brianna about the same time but it seemed to me to be way too expensive. ($100 for the hour plus $50 for the HR) and she is quite overweight albeit a very nice attitude.

I didn't realise This thread was here because the Name is not correct (I guess there was a name change in the past)

Establishment : Massage Parlour

Date of Visit : June 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_9...E-SPECIAL.html 

Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm

Rates : $50 - 30 mins

Age : Late 20s

Size/shape : 14, natural Es

Nationality or Ethnicity : Indian

Services Provided : Massage + Nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :
N.B. Mods, this establishment has been overtaken by the guys who run 1352 Centre Rd, not sure if I needed to create a new thread.

Tried this establishment for the first time since had been overtaken by new management and was not disappointed.

Rocked up on a Sunday after making a booking and was met by Nikki who didn't look like much from the outside, was led into a decently sized room and told to strip.

Nikki comes in shortly after and provides a decent massage, solid overall pressure and threw a good amount of teasing after I said that I'd been to the establishment before.

After about 20 mins was told to flip, given a bit more massage on the front before she popped the question with prices listed as $50 for topless and $70 for nude, a very nice change to the horrendous prices in the CBD and at many other suburban establishments.

Opted for the nude option and was presented with amazingly big natural tits, had to be an E cup at least, very impressive, however the rest of her body wasn't great, she had a good amount of body hair and did not look like the type that particularly cares about personal hygiene.

The HJ was quite nice and she gave me a great access to her vag and tits, she certainly has experience and knows how to please, was able to get over the line quite easily and satisfactorily, subsequently offered a hot towel wipe down which was taken.

Back to the personal hygiene, she informed me that she had a client and wanted her money asap which I provided but then she doesn't bother to change the towels afterwards, so please be aware.

Nikki works Fridays and Sundays if you want to try her out.

Age : Mid 30s 

Size/shape : Slim 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Turkish

Services Provided : Extras only. Refused to offer massage

Value for money/recommend? : NO and NO. 

My experience/comments :  

I drove up to this place to get my weekly massage.

Walked up the stairs and was met with a mid 50s Indian woman who was the receptionist. Out of one of the rooms came "Nikki" who I have previously met and reviewed here.
https://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f140/...52/index6.html

Nikki had her hair colored and was wearing a dark lip gloss which made it hard to recognize her.

Anyway I wasn't going to book her as I don't book the same girl twice (it ruins the whole point of the punt to not know what you're going to get...the excitement...the curiousity etc)

I booked 45 mins for $60 with Sky who smiled at me and said she's going out to get a coffee.

Was shown into the room and i undressed , laid down on the table and couple mins later Sky turns up and enters the room with her coffee.

She was friendly at first asking if it was my first time there to which I said yes. 

I was keeping track of time and noticed that she was just sipping on her coffee without starting the massage.

"So are you looking for any extras?"

She popped the question before the massage even began. 

"What extras you do ? " I asked with little interest because I wanted to get my massage first before the question of extras came up

"$50 for handjob, $100 for topless and $150 for body slide....but you can lick me anywhere for $170"

"Can we talk about that later? I want the massage first ..we're already 10 mins into the booked" I responded

"Sorry i don't do massage" she says. 

I was thinking what the fuck in my head and said "Ok i will book with another girl" but I actually wanted to leave.

The receptionist woman came and said that she will book me with another girl. I told her no and asked for my money back. I told her politely that I will return another day. 

"Ok no problem. But i cant give you all money back because you were in booking for 15 mins. So i can give back 75% refund" she says

"No i want a full refund. She didn't even start the massage and was offering extras."

"Sorry cant you used 15 mins of the booking, you occupied the room" she responds

"That's ok. I will call the police now and say that my money was taken but no service was given to me" I replied and took out my phone to call 000.  

Just as I was dialing she saw me typing 000 on my phone and said " OK OK . Here " and gave me back my $60. 

I left disgusted and went to the Burgled burgers which is next door, and ordered the most expensive burger and told myself "money well spent" after my last bite of that juicy fucking burger with extra bacon.

This is a massage shop i encourage ALL of you to avoid. The workers are greedy and so is the owner whom I guess is that mid 50s obese Indian woman at the reception.

So I am guessing you were unhappy with your punt? (Insert emoji for sarcasm) 

As you said you never know what you are going to get so I don't get the anguish. 
I suppose if you were after the thrill of the "chase" then its understandable.
Ultimately these places are not renown for high end or even very good massages but hopefully exceptional tugs. 

You may have missed out big time if you didn't go through with the "punt"

Yep.

I paid $60 up front for a 45 min massage, but the girl refused to offer massage. So lets say I chose her $150 extra for bodyslides and I finish in 30 mins. I would be paying $210 all up for the session without getting a massage.  I could be paying $150 per hour to an independent escort off locanto and getting full service 

This was my first time going to a RNT and having a girl who said she doesnt do massages. I was like wtf ? mine = blown

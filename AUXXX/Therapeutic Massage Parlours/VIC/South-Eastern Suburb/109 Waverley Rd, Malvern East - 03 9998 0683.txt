My experience/comments : Had just been to a taping at the Gordon St Studios so i thought i'd see what the local area offered.
Happened to see this place on my way down so checked it out as there was a Maccas across the road and i was starving.  
Anyway i paid the money up front and then i was led out the back and up the stairs.  It looked the part.  Very dark and dingy.  Thought i might've been on to a good thing.  Got lead to the room which just had a curtain in it and a mattress on the floor.  In fact i don't think you could call it a mattress.

Anyway stripped everything off despite the signs saying otherwise.  A young girl comes into the room.  She's wearing sweats and baggy shirt.  I'm thinking this now doesn't look good.
Anyway she did an ok massage but there was nothing extra offered or even hinted at.
Tea was offered before and after.

Well that hasn't been my experience so far until i went further south.  I did wonder if perhaps the local councils are stricter so the girls are more cautious.

I second lucija123 about council strictness. 6 times in the past visited the place. Drapped and undrapped, still could not get the"elusive" extra in 109 waverley rd. however, best deep tissue.

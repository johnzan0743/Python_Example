My experience/comments: (Here you must give at least a general description of the experience which you have had - 25 word minimum is required to give fellow members an idea of time spent - "Ill be back" or "good value" is not a sentence or review. ) This massage establishment would seem to employ unqualified masseurs - the shitty massage suggested limited massage experience.   Both girls spoke in an asian language constantly and nearly ignored me the whole time.   I expect that extras were available, but I was not able to break through the banter of the girls.   I voiced my disappointment to the lady at the front desk (whom I assume to be Helen?) and she refunded my money.   I will not be back.

I've been to this place as well recently.  The girls are attractive and dressed like they should give extras but there were certainly no extras given.  I asked the girl and it was a definite no, she said the reason she worked there was because she doesn't have to give extras.  Massage was only $50 for an hour but was rubbish, way too light.  I asked for harder but she really didn't know what she was doing.  

Is anyone a regular there who has had a happier ending?

Does anyone know of any "legit" massage parlours in the Oakleigh area that provide extras?

But I agree with the reviewer, if you do want a fantastic massage from a group of stunning young ladies
no RnT of course, just a great massage..  for the eastern suburbs this is the place to go

My masseuse was a lovely petite Russian Lady, strong hands, good massage
When there was a rise from junior, she politely folded a small towel over and resumed

Rooms were nice and private, fresh towels
All up a good massage for a good price

Been there a few times over the years.
When Helen was there by herself it was just one room and
she gave a good massage and then softly stroked around your legs
whilst you did the job yourself. Then about 2 years ago she set up 
a curtained off area where an older euro lady did massages but again 
just soft stroking whilst you DIY. And now she has two shop 
fronts with very attractive girls running around. All give very sensual 
rubs but no HJ. It's given a lot of follow on business
to local brothels. I give up

Went there for the first time yesterday and had quite a good double massage with Anna and Blondine. I wasn't particularly after a R&T so was basically happy with having two lovely ladies massage me for an hour. I imagine its market is older chaps who want a bit of pampering from beautiful girls without the extras. I wouldn't be pursuing multiple visits in the hope that the massages will become something more.

Spot on doug.At $50 an hour ($80 for a double) you can't go wrong but you'll never get anything other than a massage.She now has a money back guarantee if you're not happy with the massage and most of the girls seem to know what they are doing now.

I was a regular there, but have not been for a while.  Had a lot of great massages, a few very ordinary ones and had one girl (probably tried them all) that did offer HJ for $50 - can't remember her name.  She didn't look the sort at all and it was quite clinical, but a bit of thrill in a place that does not offer this service

Tried this place recently for one hour massage $50. But I did ask for a hard deep tissue massage. It was a nice massage, very soft hands. More like soft to firm. It started to get a little sensual towards the end, but no extras. She kept the towel on my private parts the whole time. The girl was from Belgium, which was a nice change from the typical Asian girls at these joints. One thing that annoyed me was the oil wasn't wiped off at all. But I was offered a water on exit. The place looks very busy otherwise! Not bad for the money! Had to go somewhere else for the needed relief!

Value for money/recommend?: Best place in town for massage and blue balls!!!

I have been there before and knew what to expect. Going to the room I was told to undress completely, which had never happened before. Got a bit excited and thought to myself could it be?

Ashley was average looking. She started off well and spent a lot of time massaging my ass but made me horny. After 30 mins or so, she spread my legs and started massaging my inner thighs. At that point I was fully erect and struggling to control myself.
She noticed my hard on and slowly moved away from my thighs. She then placed a towel between my legs to cover my private parts and at that point I knew nothing was going to happen. On the flip, I closed my eyes and was a little embarassed about what had happened. 

She continued to massage me and then started to work on my chest and tummy from behind my head. The boobs were touching my face and at that point I had to control myself.

All in all the massage was better than average but got excited even though I knew that nothing was going to happen.

I went there a couple of days ago and had a deep tissue massage with Kim. Kim is from Korea talks with an American accent. Fairly plain looking. The young blond girl on the front desk looks really cute! Not sure if she does massage. There was another cute blond girl also walking around in uniform.

Back to the massage. It was one hour for $50. She rubbed me all over my back, legs, front, hands, neck. Had her boobs almost in my face at one stage and I was semi erect. Almost over she turns the music up slightly. After reading all the reviews I didn't ask if she did any extras. Fairly decent massage. Better than your typical RnT joint.

My experience/comments: wish I had read this thread earlier , I was in the area and had some time to kill so thought I would drop in, went upstairs and was ushered into a room, no choice of lady which I didn't really mind. When Lucy came in she was quite attractive and I thought oh we'll if nothing else it should be an enjoyable massage. I was undressed and did not use towel, but t was soon put in place and that was the first tell tale. The massage was ok, nothing special but I started to get hopeful as she brushed her body against me and leaned over and almost smothered me with her covered breasts. This happened a few times so. Thought. Was in with a chance, I gently let my hands start to wander and was politely told nothing doing.

On the turn over there was the odd hint of a bit more as she leaned over from the end of the bed reaching down my chest. I actually started a conversation about extras shortly after this but was soon shut down and told in no way are they on offer. I left confused as she gave signs they were on offer but definitely nothing was going to happen. Won't be back.

I used to be a regular here,and some girls did go beyond the call of duty but they have all moved on now.A DIY finish also used to be tolerated but now even that is taboo so I haven't been back.The place now seems to be aimed at old guys who drive BMWs and Mercs who like to get massaged by pretty young things.
It is still the cheapest place in Melbourne by miles for an actual massage but the fun has definitely gone for me.

My experience/comments:
I was there three weeks ago. Not knowing anything (not a member yet in this forum) I opt for a double for an hour. Paid $80 and was let to a nice room and was told to strip down. So laying butt naked, 2 ladies came in. I remember one was black and the other was an Australian. Was very surprised that both were very nice looking and about in their mid 20's and nice bodies. The massge (face down first) was very sensual and occasionally touching the inner sides. The ladies were pushing themselves all over my nody and I was thinking, hmmm, came to the right place.
Then was told to turn over and F**k, the towels fell on the fella. The girls were still moving around with their bodies touching my hands and boobs on my face when one was massaging my body. Then I asked the question about what is happening to the fella down there. They said "no, we don't do that here' and that was it. Finished up and left. I then went to Malvern Rd, Malvern junction shop to finish the business. That is another tread.

I just checked the link you have, they are most explicit in stating no sexual service and consequences of broaching such with the staff.  The only thing you could be referring to is the reference to XXX which is, presumably, for the intimate waxing service.

I agree and they have always been like this. I remember going here when they first opened. Their ads are certainly open to different interpretations, it's all a big tease.

With all the comments here and on other sites, I don't understand why punters expect anything else here.

teltel, there are lots of ads which are "explicit in stating no sexual service and consequences of broaching such with the staff". Almost all RnTs have a sign like this somewhere in the shop. Do you believe them?

Go into any AMP and they have a sign saying "No Sexual Services" that's not new. Placing the ad in Craigslist is dodgy, just like Gumtree and Locanto. It doesn't look professional and I don't know how you can offer XXX waxing without touching the goods. They also offer the twin service and a lomi lomi spa service. All sounds like more on offer the way it's all advertised and worded IMHO. 

From all the reviews they do tease to the max! I would rather a great massage with a great finish myself.

My experience/comments:
Went to HC a week or 2 ago.  For some reason it had been on my 'to do' list after reading the reviews here.  I really enjoy a good massage and from the reviews here that is what's on offer.
Went into the room, undressed and laid on the table.  Lucy, I think that was here name, came in all dressed up in her uniform and started on my back.  As others have said, she gets up close and personal as  she does your back with plenty of body contact and her hands occasionally wandering into the inner thighs.  
On the flip, she quickly covers the nether regions with a towel, but again gives you the pleasure of her upper body leaning over (on your face) as she massages your chest and tummy.  From reading previous posts, I didn't ask for extras, but laid there and enjoyed it.
WIR?  If I wanted a quality relaxing massage with a bit of up close attention.  Because of therir strict rules, you can fully unwind there without the fear of a raid.

They are not "so" busy all the time,some days they are very quiet and I have even had them call me asking why I haven't been in for so long and would I like to come in and try someone new,which is a sure sign they are not busy.I too have had the completely silent massage where the only words spoken were "hello" and "we are finished now" and the girls were out of the room before I had even managed to sit up.The only upside to that was that there was no expectation of a tip and no need to pay one.

The massage was quite good, not much chat with the language barrier and felt her lean over me occasionally, however nothing else happened and I was too scared to ask.

Good massage but not sure if I'll return given there's no chance of any extras.

I am absolutely stuffed if I know why this place gets reviews here.
I keep expecting to see that someone got a HJ or better but nothing.
Posting a review here just advertises this place which it does plenty of by it self.

It would be the same in my opinion as posting a review of my neighbor who is a sports masseuse but I suspect he wouldn't like that.

Come on Admin lets have a massage or legit category so we don't waste our time searching for what is clearly an impossible dream.
Personally I suspect some of these posts as coming from the place itself.

It is frustrating when we go to the victorian massage section which is clearly RnT that we have reviews for &quot; legit&quot; etc.<br />
IMHO it should only be once someone or indeed more than one have cracked it for a T at least that we give them the space under the other heading.<br />
I am fed up with reviews that I can get from my sports masseuse.<br />

As I said before, tryhard, I am afraid this is not as easy at it sounds. I have had some very good extras from places that seemed legit and where I only had legit for a long time. I think most punters would have had similar experiences at one time or another.

What qualifies a legit place? A place where no one has ever experienced an extra? And what happens if you classify a place as legit then someone records a tug? Do you reclassify it on one report?

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese/Vietnamese

Services: Massage

Value for money/recommend ? Yes, just for the tease.

My experience: Always heard about Helen's massage centre, especially from her former teacher in Preston.  Popped in for the famous two girls for $80 special.  Went into the room and faced the surgical table of massage. In walks my two girls, very attractive, and wearing their uniforms of frills.

A big of roll of paper was spread across the table, just for me (I'm not that big), and the two ladies took a half of me each and proceed to give a relaxing massage.
Lots of tits in uniform views across my face, and as they leaned across me, most of the time.  Light touches of all the manhood, provoking my attention throughout.  This went on for an hour, then I couldn't hold control senses, and there was a rise... The girls just worked around the centre piece, like it wasn't there.  Then I thought to myself, this would be like the place in Preston, I just need to kick it off.  So I did.  One of the girls, just dropped a little oil onto my hand, and just continued like nothing was happening.  No other help offered... just me and two hot chicks.  All done, and they handed me a couple of tissues, thanked me for coming (not sure for which one), and left... Close, but no cigar!!... When I get the chance again, I'll just have to see how far I can really get...

Had an hour or so to kill in the area and thought a $50 pure massage would be a good way to pass the time. Rang ahead and was told that Tina would be free and directed to got to 196 Warrigal Rd. This is the 3Rd shopfront for the Holiday calm. Right on the corner opposite Kittens Carwash. I walked in and was told to fill out a personal particulars form with emergency contact details etc ( How many would put down real details?) Handed over $50 and then told to toddle off to 178 Warrigal Rd! So even though this is a legit place of cock tease only, I felt the walk of shame as I was seen by both traffic on Warrigal and North Rds ( this is one busy intersection) Tina wearing the usual blue uniform( does nothing for me and also not flattering to the girls either) She was a typical young slim student type. Asked for a firm massage and it was very good. Turned over and she started the tease with soft around the upper thighs I asked for firm on my legs and shoulders as there was no point wasting time on that tease shit. Overall good massage, cheap, stupid set up with being sent from shop to shop. ( 3 Shops all blue , uniforms blue and balls very blue!)

Not sure if anyone has had any action here or not. Walked in on Christmas eve at around 3pm and was greeted by a pretty Asian girl at the front counter. I asked for a massage and she said she could fit me in with a lady who has just started at a discount rate of $40 for the hour. I thought cool what a bargain. We went in and i stripped down to nothing and she put a towel on top. She gave a great massage and had a really prestty face but no extras offered. I tried my best by moving the towel and all the usual hints but nothing occured.
 Has anyone ever received extras here? Not sure what was going on as the place was flat out with Indian guys waiting in the waiting room. I'm sure that there is more to this place but not sure how to ask.

I mean, the massage is OK and their prices reasonable, but boy it's far from where I live!
Ashley it's the girl that I saw last time I went: very decent looking, nice build, not slim but without being fat. Euro and Asian background I'd say.
I asked for a deep tissue and I was given a stronger variation of a Lomi Lomi massage instead, not what I asked for but not bad at all... and a bit teasing.
The vichy shower (or whatever they call it) in the same room got my attention, obviously that has to happen naked, without any stupid towel, but considering the above reports I'll probably keep my money and won't risk it.
What a tease they are...

What a tease they are..

The vichy shower is the biggest con of all.$100 for an hour and all that happens is you get drowned in oil and then they wash it off,still avoiding your dick.Don't let her talk you into it.

Try the double massage well worth the $80! Finish off at a local brothel and it's 1+1/2 hrs of bliss for under $200.

Yep,she's got where she wanted to be so staff appearance doesn't matter anymore.She started out with glamour staff in short tight dresses and plenty of cock teasing with the occasional bit of joy for some and an accepted DIY ending for the rest for a bargain price.That got her into shop number 2 and doing very nicely thank you.Then when she had a big enough client base she got rid of all the girls who would allow or assist with a happy ending (even a DIY one) and told the customers that their visa had expired and that they had to go back "home" quickly.Now she has shop number 3 and an endless supply of Indian blokes hoping to get lucky for $50 and is pretending to be Daylesford in Oakleigh.Even though blokes like us paid for her to get where she is today,she has got to the point where she longer needs us.

Apologies in commenting on and bring up an old review. But certainly agree and validate all the reviews here. I use to be a regular but haven't been bak for about 6 months now. Agree it's great value for money if you are just after blue balls and a bit of a sensual massage (light sensual). Double with 2 cute girls are always nice (Phoebe). But never had any more. Would be great to know there were extras again but I've given up hope.

I have only just read this and your spot on. I spent a fair bit of my hard earned there over the years, even back before it was blue and Helen did the massage, waxing and etc. First business change she got right with cute girls, skimpy uniforms and low cleavage with the standard tits in face routine from behind your head. That was enough to suggest that might lead to a bit of extra play. I fell in love with the Korean girl Hanna and cemented my support for this shop. Stage 2 and Helen lost a some control over her girls in Shop 2 and some extra services were soon dealt with accordingly. Forget Station St and their paranoid activity, enter Helen she has put them in the amateur basket. After the sackings the atmosphere got real cold and the girls that remained shit scared of Helen, with the cute spy still employed and featuring in their photo's. Now Shop 3 with its Daylesford theme. It was bad enough to walk from Shop 1 to Shop 2 in broad daylight with a girl, then enter a door that indicates massage in full view of the traffic and as time did tell. Bingo the next day at school drop off, she was cute darl how'd you go? WTF! I have since chosen to change my venue and cash give away's.  As I sit in the traffic at the lights now, I look at the new shop and think now that's a bad move, to visit you are now in full view of the punters in their vehicles admiring the blue paint, and watching the patrons look left and right on entering, stand at reception, pay your money and then exit with a girl towards the oncoming flow of traffic to enter another door. I wish you luck lads as the school mum said. I have never seen a woman outside that place which = Massage + Asian girl + Men Only = Special Massage. How wrong she is!

If no extras are on offer, why worry about walking down the street with one of the girls? I agree it's not the best look, but hey you just went there for a massage right? 

I have seen women go for a massage there and have even brought my girlfriend along for one. The price and massage is good that's why she has been so successful. I have never been offered anything more.

There are plenty of other shops where you will get a shit massage for more dollars, then they will try to sting you another pineapple just for a two min HJ! 

Better to go to a brothel after a decent massage, if that's what you are after.

Lighten up fella. This post was an observation and based on another individual's perception of Asian + Massage equals something else. After some 100 plus visits I to have not been offered anything more other than a more friendlier service afforded to me for being a regular client. I was respectful of both the girls and the business format that yes is successful. As for seeing women there, yes I have but funny that they all seem to dress the same. As for taking your girlfriend along for a massage does she also venture with you on your other RnT and brothel exploits and proof reads your forum posts? I doubt it . Secondly yes there are plenty of other shops and for handing over a fifty to some Chinese grandmother at the 15 min mark of an hour massage to rip your cock off with no idea of sensuality no thanks. Years of punting elsewhere other than HC , I have found some special little favourites which my wicked friend negates the need for brothels. BTW Have a nice day Helen

Persons name: Kim

Establishment: Holiday Calm massage

Date of Visit: 2nd September 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink:  Massage Therapy | Waxing | Day Spa | Holiday Calm - Oakleigh, Melbourne or phone 03 9579 7725

Hours of Business: Open 7days 10am-8pm

Rates: $55 for an hour (1 girl, different rates on sites for 2 girls)

Age: early to mid 20s

Size/shape:size 10-12 (big butt and boobs)

Nationality or Ethnicity: Asian

Services Provided: Massage only

Value for money/recommend?: Depends read review

My experience/comments: This isn't the first time I have been to this place. The $55 I paid for a strong massage was good value for money I believe. But no extras were offered. I didn't ask for extras. I have never had extras at this place but a lot of times I have been allowed to be undraped front and back, but this seems to be a thing of the past as It isn't allowed now. It seems more of a challenge to try and get undraped or extras at a place that doesn't allow it so I may try again. Also if you would like to book in with the hot Blonde Australian her name is Louise.

I am a hardworking comedian and after a hard night at work I enjoy a decent massage. The pressure at Holiday Calm is just right. As for the style that is totally professional and you are asked at every stage if you are handling the pressure and depth of the massage session. I recommend this massage outfit to all my comedic colleagues. I have had a lot of pats on the back for doing so, Holiday Calm is the way to kill time with a relaxing laughter inducing massage session. Highly recommended. show more

Sorry fellas I just couldn't help taking the puss out of this outfit.

Apologies if anyone is offended by this clown comedians antics. Well Not Really. You should know that DOS Denial of service is a speciality in HC.
If you pay and make a suggestion you get D.O.S. and are shown the door.

Well I have seen plenty of doors but have never been successfully shown one when taking a stand at a shop like this one. They claim you should have read the sign saying they reserve the right to refuse service and retain your money. 

Well er ah No they cannot lawfully retain shit.

Unless you sign a statement saying that you agree to the terms of a notorised contract then they must by law issue you with a full refund regardless of whatever disclaimer they have posted.
To not do so is unlawful and tantamount to theft. You indeed have the right to call the Police and have the therapist arrested or whomever refuses a refund.

It is simply astounding the ignorance that outfits like this portray due to lack of edification. I have been massaged by these comedians and what is more I refused to pay up front. Lawfully they must charge in arrears that is after the service is performed. A point which was not lost on their receptionist.

Know your rights when it comes to consuming services of any nature especially blue balling cock teasing ones like this outfit. INDEED!

BTW If you want a laugh read my above post.

I doubt very much they have cameras in all the rooms. If they did without telling you it would be an invasion of privacy and you could sue them! 

Everyone knows it's difficult to get anything more in this shop as it's therapeutic massage only. If you want to try good luck. Try to pay after the massage? Good luck too! 

If the girl was called out after being offered $20 they may have overheard through the door, as the walls are not that thick!

There are plenty of other massage shops and brothels with a guaranteed end result, without the need to hassle all the girls at HC.

I don't think the workers would agree to being filmed whilst at work. Co-incidence is what is going on here. What you could've done is to note the name of the girl and made a booking to see her again and enjoyed yourself knowing that you like me have gotten one over this outfit.
These guys are rather nasty in an insidious way and not because they frown upon the tackle tickle. Attitude goes a long way with these guys.
Still they have a large staff turnover. That says it all.

I'd say a lot of reason they have a large staff turnover is because the girls must not get paid much if the establishment is charging $55 an hour. By the way has anyone seen the hot white girl with the blond hair there called Louise? She is Australian. Does anyone know the names of the Europeans that are there would like to make an appointment with them.

Person's Name : Min and Yen 

Establishment : Holiday Clam

Date of Visit : 19/10/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Warragul Road Oakleigh

Hours of Business : 10am to 8pm daily

Rates : $80 1 hour Double Massage

Age : Min 21, Yen 20-25

Size/shape : nice bodies nothing to write home about

Nationality or Ethnicity : Min Vietnamese Yen maybe Chinese

Services Provided : Massage only, extras 

Value for money/recommend? : Absolutely

My experience/comments : Been there about 5 times in the last 7 weeks. booked for 11am because that was the time Min was starting work. Got there 5 minutes early, Yen took me to the room and I undressed and lay down. she came back in and started the massage right on 11am, but no sign of Min.

I told her I want a strong massage and she got on top (not in a sexual way) and was using her knees on my back and bum, about 11.05 Min walks in and the double massage starts.

I know its strictly non sexual and that pisses alot of guys off, but I gotta say I have had some great massages here and I think its the best value going around for legit massage places.

The girls went through there paces straddling my head a few times with a towel over my head so i can't see. But the wonderful thoughts you have if you could see do it for me. They go through a rhythmic stage where both girls use the same strokes on each of your arms and legs and either side of your back, feels great it was a fantastic massage.

The girls finished at 12.05 so I got the full hour double massage and 5 minutes warm up. I got changed and was happy to tip the girls $10 each for great service.

If you are looking for a proper massage this is the place to go. Min is very good (had her three times) she works Friday to Sunday. Jenny is another good one she works weekends and maybe during the week. Yen was very good, first time with her but she gives a very strong massage and can be painful. there are European and Australian girls there, I have'nt had massage with any of them, the ones I have seen don't look great, one of them is a little fatty.

Prices are on the website but single massage $55 for one hour, $100 for two hours and double $80 per hour, I think its great value, just don't go there thinking you will get any extras and you won't be disappointed, but you could always get lucky.

Are you sure you don't work for HC or as i like to call them Holiday Panic.? I think that the review looks very suspicious coming on the fact that you are simply advertising their prices and service. This is not a review it is an advertisement no matter which way you look at it.

Mods should possibly look at this post and remove the ad content. that would be the whole post.  

An unimpressed!

Apologies Munckin I may have acted a little precipitously. I am aware that some of your language is straight out of the HC staff manual for promoting this parlour.
As long as you are aware that many of the staff are unqualified underpaid and exploited along with the clientelle. then all is okay.

Everybody has a different experience at this place so the acronym YMMV is particularly applicable in regard to this parlour.

Indeed if you are affiliated with this place you could simply declare that as a member of the forum and qualify this is any post. But I accept you are not wishing to promote the establishment from an insiders POV. But on the surface it sure looked like that.
So my apologies and your reputation has been restored by myself. I have returned your rep to a postive as it was my haste at an early hour of the morning.

Please accept my contrition and keep posting great reviews. 

Perhaps it might be an idea if you were to read what is on the thread and previous experiences before posting, as at times we all have different experiences at different establishments and the forum is after all a collective of shared wisdoms and perceptions by different personalities and characters looking through individual perceptions and eyes along with ways of viewing and seeing and communicating those experiences. 

Whilst this is an obvious statement it is something that others are quick to dismiss in the age of instant gratification.

The reasoning behind reading the previous posting experiences after writing your review/report but before posting the review is to inform yourself if there may well be a challenge to your perceptions. Whilst this may well not change the way your report is presented you may wish to qualify or add qualification on what you are about to post.

Perhaps if I had heeded that position I would not be having to withdraw with egg apparently all over my face.

But hey I call them as I see them at the time. I am open honest and truthful or as much as I dare to be.

So I withdraw my comments regarding your employment providing you are in agreement with this and accept my humble contrite qualified withdrawal and the fastest promotion of any member on this forum to date in terms of reputation.

FYI Thamsthon has given me a good talking too!

I think that is all.

Not neccessarily Wicked. But your point is well taken.

BTW Nothing in my apology to the Little one concedes any endorsement from my experiences with this outfit or in any way endorses the behaviour of this outfit as they troll through sites like this to promote their business.

I certainly would not recommend them as they use unqualified staff and as stated before have a high staff turnover so even if you had a good experience it would likely be a one off. and not at all likely to be conducive to a relaxing time and spend of your hard earned.

So this outfit parlour massage clinic whatever is not to be trusted in any way for consistency. You take a risk and a gamble you will need to be aware of that indeed even if you go to visit for a straight massage you may well and probably will be leaving thinking that was an hour or so of my life I will never get back.
Of course that is simply only in this man's HO.


That is something to ponder.

Point taken Bigus, and I appreciate the essay and advice. 
I know i was over top in my glowing review but it is all true. I have been to Holiday Calm 5 times in the last 7 weeks and had some great massages off very nice girls and I thought some of the previous posts were a bit harsh, but I understand why they have been posted. Whilst you might think the owner may not be the most moral person I think the girls I have had massages from there might be copping a whack for the wrong reasons. 
I have had three massages off one girl there and she is an honest hard working and very sweet girl (that does'nt do HJ's ) She left her job as a waitress in a restaurant and opted to do the training at HC, probably without getting paid but now earns more money than she previously did. She does'nt think she is being exploited and she is an excellent masseuse. When I see the negative posts about HC I can only think about the good service I have received and the minimal amount I am paying for it.
I apologize if anyone has taken offence to my post about this.

Entirely correct.Let me start by saying I was a big fan of this place when it opened up but not any more.Back in the early days when she only had the one shop there was always the possibility of something extra.I actually got my dick sucked on 2 occasions by a girl who obviously doesn't work there any more and I also ate the pussy of one of the best looking asian girls you will ever see anywhere.This behaviour may not have been expressly allowed but I don't think it would have been any great surprise to the owner that it occurred.She was employing the best looking girls and making them wear skin tight,short dresses as their uniform in order to attract as much clientele as possible.The problem is that when she got big enough she suddenly decided to go 100% legit and that threw a lot of blokes,like me,who were used to a getting something more than a massage.She pays the girls fuck all (she even used to dock their pay if they used too much oil or paper towels) and is an absolute dragon to work for,ruling them by fear.Having said all that I really don't know why anyone complains about the place as it currently operates.It is the cheapest place in town at $55 an hour and you might get a bit of eye candy thrown in but if there is absolutely nothing to suggest that you will get anything other than a legitimate massage or a waxing,how can you complain that nothing else is on offer?
It's like going to the hairdresser and complaining that you didn't get a tug,even though she brushed your arm.

Munchkin I agree with your sentiment about the workers who for the most part are clueless when they start to work at HC. The problem is they wise up fast and usually leave. Most places that are legit have qualifications to prove they are just that.

Don't get me wrong i am sure that HC has had a number of therapists who have qualifications just most have none in massage.
You cannot receive any qualification from a parlour or dayspa unless they are attached to an accredited educational facility.
It is simply a matter of proscription.

I don't think that these outfits that claim to be qualified and yet offer training are for real. It is simply called fraud.

If you really want a decent massage without the Henja then there are plenty of private qualified service providers in Greater Melbourne that can supply the result of that style. Of course you will likley pay another five to fifteeen dollars per hour but if that is what you are after then there are plenty in this category.

Rewarding exploitative outfits IMHO is a dubious spend of money and energy. 

Anyway getting back OT. HC could offer the best straight massage in the world one day but the very next day you could get the worst. It is about consistency.
Whilst it has these problems the place should not really be promoted. Of course there are some punters that will get lucky but that is the exception as opposed to the rule. There are plenty of other places that offer blue balls at the end of the massage instead of a henja. I just don't see the point in promoting them on this forum.

To do so would turn the forum into Zen Alliance or Natural Therapy Pages which I don't think is the idea. Correct me if i am wrong here. BTW both websites are great sources for potential in punting for pullers. 

That is all.

The facts are that HC cannot offer rebatable receipts legally. If they do it is called fraud and they will eventually be caught up with this down the track. Utilising another individuals accreditation is unlawful and rather foolish. If you knowingly accept and submit a fraudulent receipt then you have committed an offence. It is called fraud. So if you enjoy the massage at HC don't submit any receipts issued for any rebate. Remember there is no time limit on fraud charges being brought against anyone. Just ask Craig Thompson..  

That is all.

I visited this place recently for a wax and massage and, although obviously a legit establishment, I found the massage to be fantastic - deep tissue by a girl named Stephanie (Aussie). I'll definitely be returning as they also do remedial massage and can claim on the spot for private health cover rebates. The waxing was great also. Very quick and almost pain free. They obviously know what they're doing which is why they are successful. AB

I had a deep tissue massage today and it was bordering on pain and pleasure, great massage. The reason they are successful is good prices and great massage. You can have a double for around $80!

While I was waiting there were two bikini clad girls sun baking on the lounge across the road, doing a butt dance for the traffic! Good way to cause a spill on the road! 😄

Its a great place, excellent value for money and a great massage if you get the right girl. Just don't go there expecting extras it wont happen.
Does anyone know the name of any of the Aussie girls or the African girl that works there? Or any of the European backpackers?
As I don't like to see the Asian girls. Have seen a lot over the years but Stephanie is the only one nowadays that I know the name of. I have seen other non-asians there when I have been in but dont know their names.

This was not a credit card payment but a savings account debt. $10 extra, I quizzed the girl as I had a 2 hour booking given the good reviews. 
Yes extra for eftpos, so I cancelled on the spot. 
A good way to lose legitimate business. This was a first for me anywhere, will not give them an opportunity to get my money. There are plenty of really good legit and other places to go for a good massage.

Its been over a year since I haven't paid by cash at this place. But i remember it was a $1 for 60min via eftpos and $2 or $3 for 90min. I would have cancelled on the spot as well, $10 is ridiculous!

They may have thought it a credit card but even $2 for an eftpos transaction will lose me. I may be precious but if you don't want to offer the service then remove the ability and say cash only. 
So many people don't carry that amount of cash and sure they have an atm but business is business and losing potential customers for a transaction fee to me is ludicrous. 
Having said that I feel the same way about cafes etc that charge a minimum fee. No wonder the likes of Coles and Woolworth are taking over. 
Can you imagine the checkout chick.
"How are you today?"
Fine 
"That will be $8.25"
"Oh you're paying by eftpos ....that will be a minimum of $10 or a transaction fee of....."

Just my rant for the day ...I feel better now.

If that is the case no doubt Helen will send in a spy and then try to get them shut down.

I went there a couple of years back, actually had really good massages , but the girl at reception in the mini skirt and skin tight very low cut top was a bit off-putting and obviously not a sign of things to come. Once went for a double, had to go out on street with them and along to next shop & up stairs inside. Following them up it felt like a stairway to absolute heaven in their little uniforms, but just a nice massage. not been back in ages and its a fair hike.

I feel the only way a man can get action in this shop, is to ask the girl if u could give them a massage.  And massage her one handed while jerking off with the other hand. Other than that, u may have to force an orgasm out on your guts without her touching it.

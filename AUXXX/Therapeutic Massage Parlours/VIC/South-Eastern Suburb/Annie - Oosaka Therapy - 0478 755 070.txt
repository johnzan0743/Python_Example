My experience/comments 
Found this reasonably secluded place on Centre Road near the train lines, its upstairs and has no shop front, she has a sign out the front. Annie is about 30 from Korea, attractive with a nice body. She gives a very thorough massage and likes to get on top to massage your back, she loves to talk but asks if you prefer quiet. I don't mind a chat so no problem for me, it does'nt affect her service, she gave a few brushes around my ball bag while massaging deep inside my legs and on the flip continued around the area. She asked for $30 to complete the job and of course I agreed. There was definitely no rush to complete the job and my hands wandered up her skirt and inside her panties to play with her bare ass, she drew the line when I got close to puss so placed my hand outside her panties and she was happy to let me rub kitty gently from outside. My other hand started to wander up her top and managed to release 2 almost perfect medium sized breasts, unfortunately I could'nt hold on any longer and the fun was over. She cleaned me up with a nice hot towel and went to the head of the table and started to wash my face with some sort of cream. she then sprayed some other stuff over my face and also used a moisturiser and gently massaged my face. Different. All finished and I got up and she helped me get dressed, hug goodbye and I left feeling pretty good.
Great value for money and will return.

Person's Name : Annie

Establishment : Oosaka Beauty Therapy

Date of Visit : 23/2

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 406 Centre Road, Bentleigh

Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm

Rates : $65/hr

Age : 30ish

Size/shape : average build. no stand out features.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean (says Korean but is obviously Vietnamese)

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : Yes if it's what you're after. details below

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

After reading the comments above and also having a hankering for a spankering, and a sore back I booked and went down for a visit.

Personality wise, very friendly and talkative. Good conversation

Looks wise, she is not bad, but also no stand out features. Easy on the eye.

Service, so I booked for the hour and she gives a pretty decent oiled massage. I would have like it to be a lot more firmer and towards a traditional thai style massage in strength. Sits over you while working your back which is quite intimate. Massages the back of your legs, stomach chest, feet and hands. Towards the end the pressure and strength definitely dropped off, which I didn't mind too much as it was still relaxing. Also had my face washed with a nice face rub and moisturiser.

At no point did she hint towards anything of a sexual nature or that anything extra was on offer. I also did not ask as I was no longer interested in a tug.

Venue wise, it is upstairs, looks extremely legitimate and professional. Has two massage rooms. A whole host of certificates lines the front counter. Biggest hint to her nationality. She will say she is Korean though, I didn't prod any further but as a Vietnamese guy, it's obvious. She does have a lot of beauty and facial equipment in the rooms as well. She stated half her clientele are female, for massages and facials and the other half male.

I wasn't too interested in a tug later in the session so can't comment on how 'available' it is. It might just be as easy as asking and paying the extra.

All in all a good experience, but won't return in search of a better massage from a more attractive lady.

If you are after just a good massage try Holiday Calm in Oakleigh, no extras available, mainly Vietnamese girls, $55 per hour. Tell the receptionist what kind of massage you want and they will look after you.
You probably have to ask Annie for extras

I may have done a review on Holiday Calm a few years ago, can't remember. I have searched on the site and can't find all my reviews. Do you really want me to review a massage shop that does'nt do extras?
I have'nt been there for over a year now.

Here you go guys knock yourself out. It's the blue building where everyone leaves with blue balls. You can get your ass waxed for $30 also, but its a bit embarrassing cos you gotta get on all fours while she spreads your ass cheeks. No pain though.

Guys, Dropped in today (late morning) to see a CLOSED sign on the door. Tried the mobile a couple of hours later and got a "not accepting incoming calls" message. Maybe she is off on a long break while Metro do there crossing work a few doors down??

Person's Name : Annie

Establishment : Oosaka Beauty Therapy

Date of Visit : 21 April 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 406 Centre Road Bentleigh, 0478755070

Hours of Business : 10am to 8pm

Rates : $70 1 hour + $30 extras

Age : about 30

Size/shape : Very nice, B/C boobs, little tummy.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Vietnamese

Services Provided : Massage, HJ, PM

Value for money/recommend? : Absolutely

My experience/comments 

Firstly a few updates. 
She is definitely Thai; in Australia for 5 1/2 years but speaks excellent English; she has ~5 certificates for massage in the foyer and certainly knows how to massage; no boyfriend (too complicated); Price seems to have gone up (to $70/h), but all up price of $100 with extras is absolutely OK.

Secondly a few observations on this first encounter with Annie. 
I booked for 11.45, but a little she texted back, highly apologetic, to say that she had to put it back to 12.45 as she had some paper work to finish! It wasn't a problem so I agreed with yes of course. No problems (smiley face). She comes back with Tks a lot. See ya at 12.45. U r very nice man A good way to start
When I fronted, I made a point of saying that my mate Rob had recommended her (not true) but perhaps he didn't use that name (wink). Oh, does he have glasses? Sure I answered. 
I gave her $100 and she gave me the $30 change. She then came in with me and helped me undress! The $30 was still in my hand and so I said You can put that somewhere safe. and Maybe we need that later on. 
Once on the table, I arranged my cock between my thighs, indicated that a towel was not needed and, within 4 minutes of walking in the door, our negotiations were complete. As you can see, I like to have all the important
 things settled early. 

Thirdly - the session:
At my request, we started with a firm massage and she worked very nicely across the back and legs with good pressure and clear indications of her training. There was no need for the "accidental" touches, so she happily gave due attention to all the bits while we continued a very pleasant discussion on many topics, including the niceness of her legs (which I was caressing) and the fact that she liked my bum (always nice to hear). 
On the flip. she placed one knee on the table and turned a little, pointing her very firm arse towards me. I obliged with a feel of her cheeks and admiration of her moist pussy. She responded well but kept me knocking on the door rather than entering completely. I slid my hand up her top to find that she had already undone her bra strap prior to the flip and her firm and very pleasant breasts were fully open to my attention which, of course, I provided. (I can't say that I have ever experienced this before at such a first session)
With a little encouragement, she slipped the digit in my rear (as is my wont) and with a couple of minutes of instruction was fiddling the prostate like an old pro (well, you know what I mean). Meanwhile, she had by cock oiled up and was giving it very pleasant attention with the other hand. After ten minutes or so of mutual stimulation I exploded very satisfactorily (would like to get her to the same point one day - let's see). After a hot towel cleanup and a head massage I departed, fully satisfied and promising to return.

A quick update:

Dropped in again this week after the lady had sent me a few "why you not come back?" texts. I had sent her a few quiet words about texts out of the blue and problems it can cause with the general management.  The session ran pretty much as before so no full report this time. Just a couple of notes:

- not sure why I wrote that she was Thai last time. She is of course Vietnamese  (and much more the sharp Viet than calm Thai style) - but still a fun lady
- allowed a little more access to her lady bits this time, plenty of massaging of her impressively firm and rounded tits and arse and a bit of work around the pussy lips and clit. Could progress a little further with extra visits - let's see. 
- her place is right next to the works on one of the level crossing replacement projects which is undoubtedly hurting business. She seems to keep rather odd hours and comes in late some days (she says she is "doing her paperwork")
- no sign of any other workers in their and no Mama or Papasan, but she says she is just a worker there - sounds unlikely. 
- not a bad little set-up. Just two small rooms upstairs with access from the street and from her car-park behind - with cc cameras covering foyer and all access ways.

You have to be careful of Annie getting your number. I saw her a few months ago and called a landline number on the door. My experience was very similar to the first couple of reviews. I don't believe they are her certificates on the wall. But definitely Viet. She gave me her number after and said don't tell anyone. 

For the next few weeks I kept getting random texts. "How are you today?" "Hello handsome." Until I asked her to stop and blocked the number! It put me off going back. I checked the number recently and it comes up with an address at 452 Springvale Rd with a Vietnamese name.

I usually go to Holiday Calm for a massage. Can't beat their service and price and you don't need to talk the whole time. $80hr double. No extras. No time cheating. The girls also jump all over you and spread their legs over your body. A good tease.

I was working in the area tonight, and whilst i was not aware of the intel from the punters online, i thought i would try my luck, by just dropping in. She greeted me with oh, you have come back, i said yes, although i had never been there before. Anyway she said come back in 15 minutes and no later as she will be closing after that so please come back, and asked for my number. I said i will go for a coffee and come back. 
I thought while having coffee, to look it up here, and whammo, what can i say....there was current intel that i could get an idea. Well i went back for an hour for $65, thinking she knew me and it might be interesting to play, so we started with a standard cover the arse, good medium rub, nothing new, but she jumped up on the table, prior to going to the legs and butt. Her butt rub was very good and the towel goes off pretty quick, i think she likes playing a little. The chat got a little arousing with her suggesting would i like her finger nails to used around the butt, i said no probs. A quick cleanup with a face washer and it was flip time.
She began with covering the boys, with me looking at her and not saying a word, she moved the towel away as her eyes did the talking. Anyway straight in to the extras for $30, she began the HJ, and i got a rise out of her, with her saying good looking cock. I said that i would like to have a good touch of her, more so i would like to get her on the table and return the bottom massage. She resisted this for the whole time, but i got to touch her arse both inside and outside her undies, but not really that good in the scheme of things. A good ending after a long day so cannot complain about the punt, but for $95.00 for 1 hour, and really not much on offer this time, despite her knowing me?? Anyway if i'm near and get some intel that inspires me i might head back.

Comments:

I had visited Annie a couple of times before but gave up on visiting when they started the roadworks outside her door for the new railway overpass. I had forgotten about her until, a couple of weeks ago, I got a pleasant (and thankfully not too explicit) New Years message from her. With a bit of time on my hands, I decided to give her another try. 

Now Annie is a very pleasant young lady who seems to be making her best efforts to run a good (apparently solo) business. But sometimes she is a little frustrating. I arrived at 12 noon as agreed only to find the door locked and then to get a message that she would be 15 minutes late as she was doing her shopping! (This is not the first time this has happened). The business is on the second floor and she has a buzzer as you come through the door and a CCTV system with 4 camera angles in the stairway and foyer. When you get to the foyer she has another locked door with a little hatch through which she talks (politely) to you to check you out before heading off form a few minutes to make up the room (or maybe to run your vehicle rego through a check - who knows) and then, finally, to let you in. I guess it is a good security measure for a sole operator but it is not really so "user friendly". 

Anyway, after 15 minutes, I entered (Annie had let herself in through the back door in the meantime), went through the process and was let in to the massage room. I booked the $100 option and she set off, as always, with a very proficient massage of the back and legs (she has a diploma of some type at the front so I would guess she has some reasonable training). She works through my knots and pressure points quite nicely with some pleasant chat and enough little deviations to the inner thigh or under the hip bone to get young Bill interested. 

She dresses rather conservatively in a dark blue knee length skirt and blue polo top (probably to project the "professional" image when required), but is happy for me to explore a little way up her calf and along her thigh.  I am able to get up under her skirt and expose her surprisingly conservative )full brief type) panties and cop a feel of her pussy through the gusset.

She disappears for a minute and, on returning, gets me to flip. She oils up my legs, moving up towards young Bill who by now is pointed at the ceiling and starts a slow and very nice tug. Meanwhile, her free hand moves across my chest and she tweaks my nipples. I remember from the last time that this seems to be a signal for me to visit her titties which I am happy to do. I find that she has no bra on (which is a little inconsistent with the conservative attire) and wonder whether she slipped it off when she slipped out of the room. Anyway, she respond well to my caresses of her admirable C-cup titties and my continued work on her gusset. As we worked to my completion she gave what could have been a little shiver and quietly pushed my hands away as she proceeded to finish her work on my cock. I had had a similar experience on my previous visit and I wondered whether the happiness of her ending had matched mine, but if so she didn't acknowledge it.

After a clean up with wet towels and a last bit of work on my shoulders, she picked up my undies, turned them right way out and dressed me, then returned with my pants, socks and tee shirt, finally putting on my shoes and tying the laces. Funny, but in a way quite intimate and nice. 

With that all done, we said our good-byes, was offered a chocolate from the bowl in the foyer and was on my way.

WIR; probably. The service is actually pretty good and the price OK. I just find all the palaver with times and entry protocol a bit annoying.

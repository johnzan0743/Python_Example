My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

It's been a while.  Toad has been crushed by life's many issue and restricted from play.  Yesterday a tiny window of opportunity saw a spare hour near this venue.  Walked in off the street wanting a good massage and hoping for a little more.  Greeted by a nice looking Caucasian blond with an unplaceable Euro accent, aged maybe late 40s.  Nominated service and was led into a standard cubicle complete with its own split system air con.

Stripped off and onto the table, and in comes a cheerful Lana.  Initial chat reveals that these two have taken over the premises 2 weeks ago and are there most days.  Late afternoon workload varies a lot - last night was quiet.  A very good massage ensued with good attention to several knots.  Somehow she managed to get my hands in a situation where they were rubbing her lower belly and there was neither objection nor overt response.  Flip time and massage continued with not a hint of interest in anything extra.  Ventured a hand onto the tail and asked if that was OK, and received a "yes".  Looking good.  Then there was some chest massage with Lara working from above my head and titties (fully covered) brushing down my face.  I commented that if she was topless, I'd be licking the nipples.  Hint not taken.  Hopes lowered.  

Then she was back at the side and things were winding up.  There had been a couple of minor swipes over Toad's Tool, so it seemed that a direct request was necessary.  The response was simple - OK but you pay extra.  How much I ask.  She replies - whatever you think is OK.  So away we go.  Sadly her tug technique is not really good - finger and thumb, and missing the sensitive spots.  But she kept at it and somehow managed to change her position slightly so that there was more stimulation where it counts and eventually a mighty blast of cream was delivered.  A quiet clean-up followed by a hot towel wash finished the job.

Given that the tug was pretty ordinary and that she was flexible on how much, handed her an extra 20 and she seemed happy with that.

Would I recommend - yes for the massage but not for the tug.  Might have to try once more if opportunity presents, to sample the blonde.

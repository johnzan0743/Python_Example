[COLOR=#333333]Was free this arvo and thought of going for a good massage! I often go to proper massage place to get a massage and this time I just wanted to have lomi lomi! I wasn't far from this one as I found on locanto, made booking and went there! Not a discreet entrance! Pretty much opposite Prahran Market! I went in there and met Angela, very good looking in a nice dress, She asked me to remove my shoes and socks before entering the room. I went i there and she asked for money. Gave her two pineapples and she said she would bring the change. she goes out and and undressing myself i jumped on the table. 10 (Yes right after 10 min) another girl comes in puts $20 on the chair and asked me if i'd like soft massage. English isn't great, and i told her i want hawaiian lomi lomi. she said ok. put towel on me give me soft massage. 15 min later i asked her to make it bit hard and use oil, she said later on. Another 10 min after she get oil. She uses one hand only and no pressure it just moves slowly slowly on my back and legs. Nothing sensual. This goes on for another 10 min. I asked if I could another therapist. She said I will have to pay another $80!! WTF!!! I said I paid for full hour and I still have sometime to go. No none else is available and that is the rule set by owner. I was ready to get dressed and I asked for owned. Not available. Anyways I asked her if she knew what lomi lomi is!! No Idea about that! She said is about feeling and she gives me the way how she feel! Anyways I asked het to give me a proper massage and medium! Another 5 min!! I am bloody done here!! I asked her to wipe me down. She get the hot towel and starts cleaning me up. good thing its was only on back as there was no flip. There were couple of under body stroked near my shoulders. That was it! She doesn't even clean me up properly so I asked her if I could clean my self up. She leaves the room, I cleaned my self up. I walked out I asked she she had done any training, nope, and said Angela doesn't have any certificate either. I have done 6 weeks Lomi Lomi course in Byron Bay when I was leaning up there! I have certificate! I told her that, and she said everybody does different. I have had many bad massages, but many times their attitude and service had been made up for but this one has been the most lethargic experience ever. If just want to waste $80 by some girl moving her one hand like a snail, this is the place. I am very close to report this one actually! [/COLOR]

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Found myself in Prahran for a meeting and ended up with a few hours to kill before dinner. 

Decided to see what was around and saw an ad for Yim Siam's sister venue in Hawthorn so thought I'd give the one on commercial road a crack. 

Walked in and was escorted to a nicely appointed and dark room. Girl was dressed in traditional thai outfit and tights, but it was a cold day. (Unfortunately I just couldn't catch her name properly and after 3 attempts was too embarrassed to ask again. Apologies gents. After ISO I'll go back and confirm her name and update the listing.) Paid upfront for an hour and settled in for a massage after stripping down. 

The massage was excellent. Firm but not hard and really worked my lower back and shoulders. We had great conversation throughout. At the 30 minute mark she asked if I was after anything additional and being my first time here asked what was on offer. She giggled a bit and turned the question back on me. I offered $50 for a NHJ and she said $100 so we negotiated to half way between. She I flipped over at the point and she stripped to reveal a luscious, tiny body with possibly the darkest nipples I've ever seen on some beautiful b-cups. She was also trimmed very short down below and was delectable to say the least. She mentioned she also works at the Hawthorn venue and there is more on offer there. YMMV.

anyway, she hopped in top of me sitting on my legs and started a very sensual massage. Slow and edging me non stop for the best part of 25 minutes. A total turn on. 

We reached the end of the session which was exquisite and then a thorough clean up.  

WIR - absolutely.

It's taken years but finally a massage shop opens up in this small block of shops, opposite the bowling complex, and not far from Chadstone shopping centre.  Was looking for an add for 1414 Malvern rd Malvern, and came across this one.  Dairy bell had to move from cnr of Murrumbeena rd and Waverley rd to make way for an apartment complex, and they moved into this block of shops about a year ago.  Go in there grab an ice cream, and then walk into this massage shop with ice cream dripping from your lips.   They are next door to each other good god.

Popped in here today.  Enter from around the back, they are indeed next door to dairy bell and it is too embarrassing.  The rear entry 87a, enter under a large concrete carport, ring the bell at the back door, there are toilets next to the back entry. Met 2 girls in shorts.  Very long walk to the 1st room.  Both girls between 20 and 30, none of them did it for me, almost begged me to stay one did.  I told them i would keep looking.  Could have been any race of asian to be honest.  I wish them all the best.

Thanks, it appears to have not been a very popular shop at all.

Person's Name :  Zara or Sara (rhymes with Lara)

Establishment : ? They advertise as "Traditional Japanese Massage"

Date of Visit : September 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :   6 Station Walk, Brighton Beach - (03) 9592 1845

Hours of Business : 11.00 am -6.30 pm

Rates : $60 per hours

Age : 23-26

Size/shape : Tall, not curvy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Taiwan

Services Provided : Massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend? : so/ so - standard rate for "vanilla" service - I would not recommend this provider

My experience/comments :
First time at this shop for me. Sister shop to 240c Huntingdale Road, so quite likely the girls at this place also work at 240c. Parking in South Road seems the best option and is plentiful. Opposite Brighton Station if that  is your mode of transport. Quite, sleepy hollow part of the world, that is why they close relatively early (6.30 pm) Zara ony lady free so tried her for an hour. Very tall for a Taiwanese lady.  Massage only so so. Back first and then just prior to the flip (she already detected I knew a couple of the staff here from me mentioning visits to 240c) she asked me if I normally also get extras. Found out the only extra she offers is hj. We negotiated HJ for $30. She grudgingly accepted, commenting that she normally charges $40 and many of her customers give her $50. I am guessing that is the normal chatter to try to guilt you into a higher payment. I  indicated that because the first time with her I will only pay $30 and if good service would pay more next time (of course I always knew for me there was not going to be a next time with her) HJ ok but nothing startling. She made it clear that hj is totally the extent of her services offered to anybody at anytime. Conversation was pleasant and her English was good and she struck me as a quite intelligent lady. Just not my cup of tea. Some guys may like her, but I prefer more petite, cuter and if possible more raunchy service. Nice venue, no hassle transport, parking etc so probably worth more visits in the hope of finding the elusive hidden gem that we all crave. Pricing competitive  So for me "yes" for the shop "no" for the lady

Person's Name : Elena

 Establishment : Traditional Japanese Massage

 Date of Visit : September 2013

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6 Station Walk, Brighton Beach - 95921845

 Hours of Business : 11:00 - 7:00 

 Rates : $60/hr

 Age : 21-25

 Size/shape : Medium

 Nationality or Ethnicity : Taiwan

 Services Provided : Massage and HJ

 Value for money/recommend? : It was OK

This place is quite easy to find, near the end of South Road, just before the railway line. As this is the sister place of the one on Huntingdale Road, there is a bit of swapping of girls. When I rang to check who was working, I didn't recognise any of the names so what-the-hell, time for a genuine punt. On arrival, Chloe the owner greeted me much to my surprise and hers as she knows I have a couple of regulars at Huntingdale. I explained I haven't been here before and wanted to check it out. It was quite amusing as there were 2 average girls out at reception who were available. Chloe must have either sensed the not-so-enthusiastic look on my face or she remembered the type of girl I like as she called out the third girl who happened to be on the toilet! She was right, I picked Elena (still not 100% sure whether that is exactly her name but sounded like it).

In the room, I handed over the $30 for "special massage" as she put it but unfortunately her English is very poor. We spent a few minutes trying to communicate whether nude was available or not. Eventually, we settled on "no, nude" but maybe if I invested enough time in her, it could be possible in the future. I told her I only wanted my lower half massaged and it was pleasant with nice "accidental" touches and build up. On the flip, she gave a pretty good tug with the occasional shy giggle which always turns me on. Much preferable to the fake moans you get from some even when you are not touching them! She allowed a bit of play with her legs which was nice.

WIR? Yes I will just to see what I can achieve next time. Unfortunately, her English is really bad so I can't see myself seeing her long term as I like to have a good chat with the girls. In any case, she is only here on a 1 year working holiday but we couldn't quite work out when that will finish. And of course, I will need to get nude!

Btw, this place has reduced it's rates so a 30 min massage is now $40 whereas it's $50 in Huntingdale.

I believe there's been quite a turnover of staff at this place lately with a few of the more experienced girls moving on.

Unfortunately, true. Most of the Viewpoint/Huntingdale girls have gone. The place is still clean and tidy but new ones are very reluctant to shed their clothes.

Person's Name : Lara

Establishment : 

Date of Visit : early November 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6 Station Walk, Brighton Beach - (03) 9592 1845

Hours of Business : 11.00 am -7 pm

Rates : $60/hour

Age : mid to late twenties

Size/shape : Tall and slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Taiwan

Services Provided : Massage only

Value for money/recommend? :  cute, but not much action

My experience/comments :  My first visit here was with a pretty chubby Taiwan girl.  She offered hj for 30 and topless for 50, but she wasn't particularly attractive so I turned it down.

I saw lala on my second visit.  She's very tall - I guess around 176cm and very slim with a nice tight bod.  Her massage was professional and she was open to a bit of light touching and cuddling.  I didn't ask (or get) a HJ, but she did tell me nude massage was "impossible".

She's a nice girl and affectionate and would probably open up a bit more on subsequent visits - pretty much have to develop a GF type relationship to get more than a basic HJ

Person's Name : Kiki

Establishment : Station Walk

Date of Visit : early November 2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6 Station Walk, Brighton

Hours of Business : 11.00 am -7 pm

Rates : $60/hour

Age : mid to late twenties

Size/shape : medium height, slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Taiwan

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : After the relaxing and GF type experience with Lala (or perhaps I should say "wife type experience - friendly and affectionate, but no sex!   ) I thought I'd also have a massage with Kiki.

Kiki is very attractive and gave a nice massage.  She really turned me on by caressing around the old fella from behind, when i was lying on my front.  

She really knew how to use her hands and gave a great HJ.  

The only weakness was she remained clothed the whole time.  A bit of touching was ok, but nothing too full-on.

Still, very relaxing and a nice experience - good value for money

Person's Name : Maggie

Establishment : Station Walk

Date of Visit : 27th May 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6 Station Walk, Brighton

Hours of Business : 10.00 am -6 pm

Rates : $60/hour + $50

Age : late twenties

Size/shape : medium height, slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : R&T + Body Slides

Value for money/recommend? : Yes/No


This place has been around for a while, its surprising how little foot traffic there is as its right on the train line. You can park in the street behind this little group of shops and even walk to the entry of the shop via vacant land right next to the shop. All the rooms in this place are upstairs and i think 3 rooms in all. One big room with 2 tables and the others are very small rooms with tiny tables. I got the big room and the table next to the window, they get a fair amount of natural light also so there is no hiding lol!

Maggie is a very friendly and very talkative girl, ive seen her a few times now. She offers a pretty professional massage every time and if you have any muscle pain she is pretty good at ironing that out. She loves to talk and if you give her the right topic i fear she would never stop! i just prefer small talk when face down..just my preference really. I had some serious hamstring pain and she really helped relieve alot of it which was great. what ever ur session time is she will normally start light teasing with around 15-10 mins left. More than likely you would never have to ask her for extras and i think most time $30 would cover a nice slow HJ. But i asked her if she could do some body slides and she agreed. This was with about 15 mins left and she started taking everything off. Her Body slides were pretty good, very slow and plenty of attention paid to the right areas. I lightly started to touch her hips and worked my way a little further to her butt which she had no issues with, she slowly started to move her body higher and higher and i moved my hands around and brushed her pussy and it was dripping. But then as i touched her back i realised she was sweating...and i mean her back was really wet. i thought at first that it must have been the oil from the slides but she never once used her back on my. it was just perspiration. Then all of sudden i copped this wave of something that just really smelt bad. it was her natural odor from all the perspiration and the dripping pussy was now just a perspiring pussy. The smell was unbreakable and i even started to wonder how she could not smell it. It totally broke me and my hands just flopped to the sides so i could wait the final slides out.

Without this occurring it would have been promising. She had a great body, not super slim just enough curve to be balanced well. Small breast but perky. She smiled alot and she even looked up to a little more. But i was broken and just needed to get out for the sea breeze which was a massive upgrade compared to what i just endured. 

Maybe im being a little harsh, it could have just been a bad day. But i have witnessed this once before with a girl at tokyo milk in st kilda but i think that girl just didn't shower or clean herself properly. Anyway id say its 50/50 i go back. if anyone wants to confirm what i experience i believe she only works on Wednesdays at this shop...good luck!

Person's Name : Coco

Establishment : Station Walk

Date of Visit : June 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 6 Station Walk, Brighton

Hours of Business : 10.00 am -6 pm

Rates : $60/hour

Age : 20s

Size/shape : size 12, massive cans

Nationality or Ethnicity : Taiwanese

Services Provided : Massage and offered more

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : So I thought I'd head down here as it sounded like it had potential and I had nothing better to do. Rocked up without a booking at 11am and the shop was just opening up which I thought might be good as it often means cleaner towels etc. Was met at the front desk by Coco who looked nice but was dressed in black jeans and a puffer jacket which was needed as the shop was absolutely freezing.

After sorting out financials, headed upstairs to a large double room where the heater was just turned on as I undressed, it must have been 5 degrees in the room! Undressed and lay down on the table and Coco soon returned. A little bit of chit chat to work out her name etc and she started a regular massage, even covering me up with a towel which was nice as I was literally shivering from the temperature.

Moved on to the legs and there was some brushing of the crack and sack and which was a good sign but then I was only offered HR. I enquired about more but she declined and said that she only does that for her boyfriend. I asked if her boyfriend enjoyed knowing she gives HR and she giggled - what an idiot... Anyway, I didn't want a freezing cold HJ anyway so I declined - a loss for both of us.

The massage was ok but nothing special and the service was poor. 

WIR - Nah - AND I was so horny after leaving I ended up heading over to Club 8 for a FS session.

My experience/comments: 

Followed the leader so I thought I'd ring this joint and spoke to mamasan to see if they were still open and how much the services were. It appears they close at 9pm and last booking has to be taken at 8. Still enough time. Oh she also said this was a professional massage and provide good service. From what I heard, it has shower facilities. I thought it a bit odd that this was known but who am I to judge. Got on my bike and parked straight out the front. 

Met two old mamasans and the front. The one I spoke to on the phone took down my name at the front counter (not my real name) and asked how long i wanted to stay. I said 1 hour and handed over eighty. The place is huge inside and has large massage rooms with walls that don't go to the ceiling. Each room has kitchen sink. Sh tells my to take off al my clothes and cover up with the towel. I do as I am asked and she leaves and turns on this horrid happy chinese music. Not something that should be played in a relaxing environment. But anyway. Quite dark in the room. I hear a knock at the door and in walks a young PRC 22yo  (if that) in short denim shorts. She grabs an electric blanket and covers my legs with it. Pretty good service at this stage. 

What eventuated was a very professional massage. Everything was given attention as you would expect in reputable joints to the highest degree. I almost fell asleep. No touching of the jatz at all. Oh well, I thought, great massage. On the flip, same continued and the last part she began to massage was the lower abdomen and old mate was peering out from underneath the sheets. A couple of brushes over the top and she lets me know its finished. I point she gets the message and an excellent completion to the massage was done to the tune of thirty. No return touch allowed.

E**** has been in Australia for about eight months. She speaks good english. Massage skills were top notch and knows her way around. recommend you go and see her. Forgot to ask when she is there though. 

Cheers,

MN11.

PS. she is easy on the eye but face has acne marks.

Have visited this place before and have had some memorable visits with Kim but she was not working today so I went with lucy. She was an extremely cute young girl but the massage was too mechanical. Felt like an eternity in the 30 minutes I was there. On the flip tried to see If there was more on offer but was only offered HJ and that too was mechanical, just felt like she was going through the motions. Will not be returning.[/COLOR][/COLOR]

I don't think this is the same Lucy as reviewed above, as that Lucy is described as "petite", whilst the Lucy I saw was about 5Ft 8in, slight tum. Quite pretty though,mid twenties and not much English.

Massage was reasonable. Applied good forearm pressure, but lost it a bit when using her hands. Didn't seem to have any sort of rhythm. Fotunately she used her forearms more than her hands. Spent plenty of time on my bum, but kept well away from the tackle. On the turnover, applied oil to my upper thighs, and automatically applied a bit of oil onto my dick. Then she negotiated, HJ plus topless for $50, to which I agreed. After taking off her top, and revealing a very perky set of B cups, she wiped my hand with a wet towel and placed it on her left tit. She then went to work. Unfortnately it was all over much to quick.

Lucy concluded the session with a nice relaxing head massage.

[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments :

This is a newly opened shop that I decided to try today as I was in the area.They have some pretty reasonable opening special offers so I tried half an hour at $35,not really expecting anything spectacular.There was no choice of masseuse and I was given the only available staff member which was a short,50 plus Thai lady that looked like someone's grandmother.Started with a cup of some sort of tea and a foot washing in the reception area and I was then taken to the massage area which is about 3 or 4 tables separated by curtains.I was told to strip and put on a pair of boxer shorts which were on the table.
The lady returned and even though she didn't say much she gave me a very good massage.At one stage she pulled the shorts down and gave me a butt massage that left me with a monster hard on and I was hoping that more might be on offer.Alas,this was not to be and all I got was a very good massage at a price that you usually only get in Sydney.Afterwards I returned to the reception area to collect my shoes and socks and was then given another cup of tea and saw the other masseuse who was a 40 something Aussie lady.
I had a good chat to the young girl who was on reception who I got the impression was the owner and she told me about some of their other special deals,the best one being $40 for an hour if you go there before 1pm.At that price it would have to be the best deal in town and I will be returning asap to take advantage of that before it ends.
I doubt extras would be on offer as there is no privacy but if you just want to relax without spending much money you would like this place.

Went to this place yesterday. Great massage but I think it's almost time for me to retire. hahaha

Masseuse was a young guy. No chance of extras for me. Great massage though.

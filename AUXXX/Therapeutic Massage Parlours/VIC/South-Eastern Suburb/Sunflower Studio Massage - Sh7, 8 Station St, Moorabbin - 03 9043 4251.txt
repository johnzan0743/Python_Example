My experience/comments: 

New place opened up down in Moorabbin, looks very clean and well presented and the rooms were curtains dividing the three cubicles. Receptionist was a Chinese girl named Emily who introduced me to a young girl named Rachel. She didn't look fully Chinese but she was available and very cute. I didn't get the feeling that this was a RnT place because of the lack of sound proofing between cubicles (just thickish curtains). Anyway they had a promo that was 10% off on massage, so was $63 after discount so decided to take a punt.

I nuded up in the cubicle and Rachel she draped a towel on my bare ass and asked me if I wanted the pressure firm, medium or soft, so I said firm/medium. The oil was good not that baby oil stuff. She used her elbows and did a very good massage. Talking to her said she was taught by a tutor from Shanghai while she was doing massage in Hong Kong. Anyway I did ask if she did extras and was responded with a firm no. I didn't mind as I don't mind paying for a quality firm massage. Chinese tea was a nice touch afterwards. 

Regardless this place is legit guys, guess it is setup for the housewifes and ye olde types of Moorabbin. Great massage though if that is what you are after.

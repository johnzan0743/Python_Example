My experience/comments : I dropped by for a 1 hour massage with no booking.  Taken upstairs to a largish room and asked to undress.  Massage table was large comfy type, with thick clean towels.  After waiting for what seemed like an eternity, ML returned and began a strong massage - more deep tissue than relaxation, but very good.  After the flip she massaged my legs, head and abdomen.  She had a very friendly personality, and knew all the right spots.  Overall I was happy enough to leave her a tip.

My experience/comments :

Finished my exams thought i deserved to relax abit, called up Jasper as their they were advertising all over locanto with a very similar style
to Express at burke street. Jasper was closer so decided to give them a visit. Called around 9 for a booking at 930, showed up and payed the 55 for 30
( very pricy imo) in came a pretty vietnamese girl named Kelly who i've seen before at Express Massage, she says management there has taken over 
this store. Moving on to the massage, very firm with good amount of strength behind it, however very little teasing. towards the end i popped the question
to which she agrees and does not mention a fee which is nice. Tug was decent with a good amount of oil and ball play. Finished, got wiped down with
hot towels and left. Overall a good punt, maybe the fact i got to save $30

I love this place because they have shower facility! You won't feel regret about the oily feeling in some AMP.

There's already a couple of threads on this shop.It used to be called Jasper Day Spa and had Vietnamese staff so it looks like it's had a change of name and direction.Same phone number though.

    Nationality or Ethnicity : Pretty sure she was Vietnamese, but she said she was thai

    Services Provided : Tug

    Value for money/recommend? : Pretty good

    My experience/comments :

    Had some free time on a saturday morning and decided to make a quick visit to Jasper, made a booking for 30mins for a Thai girl - sent a text earlier and got a reply saying " Vietnamese, Thai, Taiwanese and filo chick working today', 
     went inside and same routine as always, undress, lye down and wait for the ML to arrive. In came Emmy/Tammy, in terms of looks she's okay, not ugly but not attractive either. On to the massage part, it was real good, teasing in the right 
     places until she asks for the flip and 4 fingers, asked if 3 was okay and she agreed. Overall decent punt, nude was not offered but touching was for 50 but she didn't look worth it anyway. 

    On the way saw a real cute chick, who was the real thai girl, will probably visit again and book her.

I had the  misfortune to visit this business late last year - unfortunately I had the not read above reviews at that time - otherwise I would have been forewarned (and stayed away). Anyway, I fronted up and was greeted by a young and admittedly fairly attractive young lady. After paying the standard entry fee and haggling about the extras I paid the extra $50 with some trepidation because the vibe wasn't great. It was apparent that she was young and inexperienced - I got the feeling she was in her first week in the business. Not that it necessarily a deal-breaker. Sometimes there is nothing better than an enthusistic former amateur who still thinks she is wanking her boyfriend in the back seat. 

Anyway, it became clear that this lady had little back seat - or any other experience. To discuss her tugging performance, think of a (mild) arachnophobe to whom you are introducing your favourite Hunstman. "Just stroke it, honey. Just a little bit more around the head" . And any attempt to feel her comely young arse (albeit through 3 layers of fabric) were beaten off as if the huntsman itself were creeping up her leg. 

Now I have been around the traps for many a year and have had more tugs than most of you young bucks have had hot dinners. But is many years indeed since I have had to ask an ML to cease and desist while I applied my own DIY skills before beating a hasty retreat.

My recommendation regarding the main things to avoid (in no particular order):
- the Black Plague
- this establishment

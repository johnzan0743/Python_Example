I was driving  through the short cut to High Street Road and saw the above premises. I then remembered comments made by Brauninc in relation to the Forever Young shop in Oakleigh. This Chadstone shop must be a 'relation' to the chain that is frequented by our aforementioned friend.

The sign on the door window read 'under new management - shop renovations - sorry for the inconvenience' phone number as detailed. I dialled and no answer.

Under new management......yeah ...there was also another notice attached to the door...Proscribed Brothel, dated 3/4/17.

Ahha......Under new management " The State of Victoria"...Dan Andrews is now running a brothel....He finally found his calling......

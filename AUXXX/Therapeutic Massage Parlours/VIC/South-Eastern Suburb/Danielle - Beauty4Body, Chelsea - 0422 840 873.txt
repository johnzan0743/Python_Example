My experience/comments : Here's a review on Danielle, which I've been wanting to try and curious about since this is the only place near bayside that provide lomi-lomi massage. one of the best lomi-lomi massage I ever tried in Melbourne. First impression on Danielle, quite ok but a bit MIL. she greeted me with this cheerful voice, which is a plus point because I like friendly girl. came into the room and she straight away undress me and asked me to lye on the bed. then the massage was ok and sensual especially when she applied extra strength to massage my back and groin area. in terms of skill, she is better than any other masseurs that I have tried before. Too bad that no touching and even I offer for extra $$$, she refused to do with topless. anyhow we managed to finish the session with hand jobas I cant hold her sensual touch and strength. well this is where I lost my battle. I think I had so much fun with her and wonderful experience. will definitely go back next time to try other girl...

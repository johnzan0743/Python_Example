Rates : 75 per hr (massage only)

Age : 28

Size/shape : slim athlete 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : HJ $30

Value for money/recommend? : yep

My experience/comments : well, it's a nice clean place with solid tables as they like to walk on you a bit.. You'll get a great massage if you need one and they are happy to leave it at that. However you won't be offered anything else unless you ask which I did about 3/4 of the way through. Negotiated 30$ HJ with her fully clothed. I reckon if your her regular she'd do lingerie or naked for a bit more again. But I was a New customer for her. She was very nice and chatty. 60% spent massaging back, but not much teasing. Once you flip over its game on and she will keep going until you're done. 
HJ gets a 6/10 and her looks probably a 7.5/10.

overall a good reliable massage if you need one with added bonus at the end.

My experience/comments : I had been a couple of days earlier to a new (so far legit, but encouraging) massage place* just a few doors up. Being left with an itch needing to be scratched gave me thought to revisit the Thai shop and sample again the charms of young Kate.

The Bangkok retreat is a moderately legit-looking Thai shop - though I have since learned that Kate is not the only ML there who goes "above and beyond". I had seen her a few times a while back but she only works weekends. Kate welcomed me with a kiss hello and gave me a "Been a long time". I apologised and said it was hard for me to slip out on weekends. As she started her work, we started talking about the first time I had been there. 

On that first visit, I had booked an hour, looking for some work on my back and with the hope of something more. I had been shown to a nice private room and nuded up. Kate came in, didn't try to cover me (good sign) and hopped up on the table, apologsing that she was "overweight" and didn't want to apply too much pressure, kneeling on my back. "I think you're very nice" I replied. "Anyway, I don't like the skinny Thai girls " (Always helps to butter them up a little).

She worked through my back and glutes then started Thai massage on the legs, pulling the legs apart, feet pulled back and kneeling on the calf muscles. By now, young Bill and the boys were on full display to young Kate who was obviously not perturbed. At 35 mins, she asked me to flip and then worked up my legs applying nice pressure to the thighs and then either side of a clearly interested young Bill. "Sorry" she said, I need put pressure here. "No problems at all" I responded. We quickly negotiated $40 for "extras" and she proceeded with a very nice slow oily HJ which took about 15 minutes to reach its destination. While this was proceeding, I slid my hand up here tee shirt and into her bra, cupping a DD natural breast and large and already erect nipple. I undid her bra, released her lovely titties and started in on one, drawing her nipple into my mouth and softly biting with my lips. What followed is what you take a punt for - her hand cradling the back of my head and drawing it backwards and forward to her breast. Nothing like a girl who is enjoying her job. By the end, I was sitting on the table, she wanking me wonderfully , me sucking her titty with one finger wedged firmly up her pussy, sloshing backwards and forward and flicking her clit on the way through. I the end, her sloshy puss was becoming too noisy and we had to slow down, but by then, the sap was rising and I presented her with a decent handful of cream

On my return visits I had cut the one hour back to 45 minutes (for $60) and pretty much disposed of any pretence at therapeutic massage in favour of a more erotic approach (and also keeping within my $100 all up budget). So today, after a hug, she whipped her top off showing her impressive titties and a belly which exercise in the meantime has reduced just a little, settled in between my thighs and started an oily massage of leg, bum and, pretty quickly, Bill and the boys. Remembering her training from previous visits, she slipped a finger in and palpitated the prostate which had me pretty horny by the flip. She sat facing me with her legs under mine and started working cock and arse in a leisurely fashion that had me heading slowly towards the inevitable for the next ten minutes. Her tits are available for heavy attention but, sadly, her pussy stays off-limits. After the second visit (which had involved a rather dramatic escalation of erotic engagement) this compromise approach had been the norm. In any case, the service, as ever, is superb. I finish a quivering mess and inquire if the bed is available for a sleep-in until lunchtime. She smiles, gives me a nice clean-up with the hot towels, gives me a kiss and says, "You come back soon this time". "I'll try", I reply. I will.
* Note: another good story but I am loath to post here given the legit status of the new place.

As my first report seems to have been well received, I will give you the heads-upon our second engagement (which may have led to the later ceasefire and rules of engagement which now seem to apply). On the second visit, I had reminded young Kate of her her highly lubricated and voluble performance. This seemed to resonate with the lady who quickly joined me in a state of déshabillé on the chaise longue and was happy to assume a position which allowed, nay encouraged, me to undertake a complete gynecological investigation of the young lady using only my tongue and two fingers. This specialist treatment seemed to be highly regarded by the lady who reciprocated with an analagous (in so far as such as possible) investigation of my own organs of reproduction. It had reached the stage where I was suggesting a protein injection for the lady, to be taken orally, in multiple doses, over 8 to 10 seconds. She declined that option, but was clearly keen for more. She slid down south, rubbed her small erection against my somewhat larger one, made enthusiastic noises suggesting an approaching climactic event and, before I realised, carried out a quick slipadictomy. A few moments later we recovered our senses, withdrew to consider our options, progressed to a more conventional ending and went our various ways. I was back the next week to see if I, having now arranged precautionary measures, might be blessed with an extended version of the above. But alas, it was never to be. Sad, but in retrospect, those spur of the moment, against the rules, punts are sometimes the ones you value most.

Absolutely spot on Bill.
This one would have to rank high on the honours board.
You should publish a text book to guide junior Gynaecologists.

I have alas not retained, following my retirement, my FRANZOG standing (though I do like, as they say "to keep my hand in"). 

I am therefore unable to get published my paper provisionally entitled "Randomised clinical trials regarding routine gynaecological examination". I have, however, received an advance for publication of a re-edited version under the title "A Dummy's Guide to Pussy Fiddling"

Hilarious Bill. 
I needed Google's help to understand it, so I'll just subscribe to the Dummy's one.

Best massage ever!! i have been back to this after two years and i must admit the girls are really good and nice!! can't complain because the room was nice and cosy and warm and the girl i had (can't remember the name, but busty, dark girl) started rubbing me. she had really nice hands and when i asked for HJ, she said it will be 30$ extra and started teasing my balls and around my bum area. we had a good conversation. she was very cheeky and friendly!! then i asked to turn around because i was too excited. she grabbed my balls and my dick tightly and then gently to play with it, she let me squeeze her bum and big boobies  and i just shoot everywhere!! 

Will definitely go back next week.
70$ for 1hr massage + $30 HJ, $100 = worth my money!!!!

i will try nude massage next time for sure, that girl had nice body!!! want to see more - i think it 50$ extra with HJ. 
this place is good and that girl had good hands. will ask for the name and let you know.

rabbot how long ago was this? Reviews without the name of the provider are not much use to anyone.

HAHA, I will try it one day but have to many other places I want to try first.
Malaka think I will be heading back to Happy Day Spa today or tomorrow to see Sugar and use my $5 discount card.

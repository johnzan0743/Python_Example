[COLOR=#333333]My experience/comments : [/COLOR][COLOR=#333333]Saw this place on Gumtree and was in need of a quality massage.  Called up and got a nice girl on the phone, asked the rate and then booked for 1 hour.  I arrived and was shown into a massage room (full walls and solid door) and was told that for an oil massage that I needed to remove my clothes.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]After about 5 mins in walked Shirley.  She is small, well dressed, spoke ok English and for her age is not too bad on the eye.  She asked hard or soft to which I said Medium.  She gives a great massage.  Fairly vigorous but if all you wanted was a good massage then she ticks that box.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#333333]There was the usual rub of the tackle and butt crack and on the flip she asked if I would like the boys massaged also.  I of course said yes.  She said $30 which seems to be the standard and a fair price and off she went.  Great technique and allowed a bit of rubbing through the clothes.  After I made a mess she cleaned me up. There was no rush or demand for the $$ at the end so all in all a great experience.[/COLOR]

Went in on the weekend.
Asked for Shirley- but no Shirley.
Instead a mousy student type who gave a crap massage.Should have made a dash for it then.
As per usual the other brain won.
She asked $50 for "down there". We settled at $30 and i had a dud unerotic mechanical HJ
****note to self- if the girl is untalkative,mousy, unfriendly and novibe then the handjob will most likely be a total dud
dont ever do it again Treva !

Services Provided : massage + hj

Value for money/recommend? : massage was okay, hj was really good. she seemed to enjoy it.

My experience/comments : First time visiting Bella Life, so made a booking for a 1hr massage. Turned up late to to horrendous traffic, staff were understanding and changed my booking to only 30mins. 
Shown to a room, very dimly lit and cold.
Receptions turned on heating, but it was split system (blows more cold air than hot to get started.
Stripped down, no towel to cover myself so laid naked on bed. Masseuse comes in, asks what type of massage I would like...etc
Back and leg massage was ok, didn't pay much attention to butt cheeks or inside thigh.
Asked me to roll over, and did not cove me up. Started to massage my chest and top of legs, brushing my cock with every second leg stroke. After a couple of minutes she takes my cock in her hand and ask if I want it massaged also, and I agree. She say I tip $40, off offer $30 and she accepts.
Nice hand job action, not rushed. She lets me touch her anywhere, but only on outside of clothes.
After I cum she goes and gets a hot towel to clean up, very sloppy job of cleaning me up.
I would possibly go back, but would make sure room was warmed up beforehand, and ask if the receptionist massaged as she was very hot!

Person's Name : Lin/Lee?

Establishment : Four Seasons Massage Therapy

Date of Visit : early June

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 712 High St Armadale

Hours of Business : 10am-8pm

Rates : $80 for one hour

Age : 20s

Size/shape : petite

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Massage, HJ (sort of)

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : Decided to pop in here having only noticed it recently. With other businesses nearby charging less for massage I thought there might be extras here.  The place is very clean and the rooms are well appointed as well. The masseuse was a short and petite girl with a name starting with L...sorry, could be Lee, Lin, or something like that.  Anyway, she asked for strength of massage and I opted for medium.  The massage overall was good though a little procedural.  There are notices around the premises informing clients that no sexual services are provided.  Flipping to the front the masseuse's hands tantalisingly kept brushing against the jewels plenty enough to get the blood rushing for a half salute.  Noticing my response she asked whether I'd like 'hand relax'...but at 50 for the pop, I declined. She did offer 40, but with time almost up it didn't seem worth it for a rush job. Nothing else on offer here as far as I could tell.

This place was my backup when I was in the area and nothing else available.

Fuck me, dropped around yesterday arvo for a quick one and the place was closed ... actually, closed down! The shop interior was completely cleared, empty, even the counter was gone. 

Someone left in a hurry.

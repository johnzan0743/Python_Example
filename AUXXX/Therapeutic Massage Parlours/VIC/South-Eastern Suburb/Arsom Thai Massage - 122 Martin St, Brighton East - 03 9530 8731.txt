Value for money/recommend? : Great massage - took some convincing for the tugg and was quite amaturish.

My experience/comments : Have been in melbourne quite a bit over the last few months and took the oportunity to get a few massages. After making a phone call to this place and asking the question i was told they can not discuss this on the phone. Sounded like a goer to me so off i went to this place on the last visit where i was massaged by a verry cute young thai girl. on the flip i asked about extras with the usual hand geasture but was flat out told no. Asked again as i was hard a rock and there was no hiding it but still got a no.

Anyway left thinnking that maybe ona return visit more would be on offer.  So i didnt get the cuties name but tried my hand at this place this week when i was back in town. This time i was massaged by Joji an older lady but still not to bad looking. Massage was excelent so i thought what the hell and on the flip i asked the same qyestioon but was greeted with a no. massge continued and up to the top of my thigs and the towel on me was doing absolutly nothing. i asked again and offered $20. no was the reply. at this stage i was desperate so offered $50 and this was accepted.

Joji was very nervouse and not the best at the craft but for me it was mission acomplished.

A bit pricey for what you get but a great end to a great massage all the same.

Overall a pretty good experience.

Yeah I agree with EMP. I think Awesome Thai sounds much better!
Arsom sounds too close to Arse foam or Arse phone. 
Brown froth or greasy telephony doesn't make me want to go there!

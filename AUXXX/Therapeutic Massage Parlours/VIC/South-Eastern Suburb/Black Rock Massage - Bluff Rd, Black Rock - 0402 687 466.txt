This shop previous advertised Lomi Lomi massage on Gumtree but advert has now been taken down. Place is still open and phone number still works.

I think there might be three ladies working there - one American, one Australian, one European.

Have been there twice. First time I saw the American lady. Phoned and made a booking. Told $150 for 1 hour and bring some additional money to "make it more sensual". Given the address which is a shop front in Black Rock.

Greeted by the American lady. She is absolutely stunning. Early to mid 20s. Petite. Amazing trim body. She was dressed in black figure hugging clothes. 

Told $150 for normal service. Add an additional $50 for her in a bikini. Add another $50 for topless. I went the topless option which made it $250 all up.

She indicated I should strip off completely and lie face down on the table. 

Massage is excellent. Probably a bit harder than a normal lomi. She clearly has done massage before. 

At points of the massage whist I am lying face down she gets up on the table and sits on my legs when she is massaging my back. 

Although she does not avoid my package, she nevers touches it. All very professional.

Turnover about half way through. Everything remains very professional. I have a serious hard on so eventually I ask about extras. She says these are not offered at all. However, she will give me some "time" at the end to look after myself. 

Near the end of the massage, she leaves the room and mentions there are some tissues in the room. She then comes back 5 minutes later and does a wash down with hot towel and water.

About a week later, I thought I would try again with another lady to see if she does any extras. Book the Australian this time. She is in her 30s or maybe 40s and average looking. Had almost the same experience as the American. However, when I ask about extras she starts waffling on about breathing techniques that can be used to reach new levels of ecstasy. 

I get the impression that extras are never available at this place.

The place is in Bluff Rd. I cannot remember the name of the business. I don't recall there being any branding on the shopfront.

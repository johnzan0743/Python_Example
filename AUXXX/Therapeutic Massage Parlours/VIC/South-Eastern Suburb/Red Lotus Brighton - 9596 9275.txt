My experience: 
This is the sister shop to Cheltenham. I booked ahead blind, having not been here. Paid up at the desk. The girl called out Lisa and a tall chubby girl took me to the room. I was hoping it wasn't her and maybe I should back out. But I paid and didn't want to be rude. I quickly undressed and thought the worst thing that could happen was a good massage.

I lay down and relaxed before Lisa returned. She offered Relaxation, or Deep Tissue. I went with the Deep Tissue. Lisa has trained in massage and is still studying. Her technique was actually pretty good. The best so far from this particular shop. If anything it was a little too deep at times. 

I lay there and tried to zone out, without saying much. On rollover, I lay there naked. Her hands rubbed up and down my legs and stomach very close to my pubic area without touching. I was starting to rise slowly. She asked if I wanted a massage there. Pointing at my cock. 

She said $30. I thought it was too much since she wasn't exactly turning me on and offered 20. She said ok if I was a good boy. Not sure what that meant. Anyway I closed my eyes and thought about the hot girls at my gym.

Her HJ technique wasn't as good as her massage. I don't know what it was. The grip too light, too much oil, or concentrating too much on the sensitive head? I gave her instructions and some guidance. Soon enough the lava was flowing and it was time for a wipe down.

She finished me off with a head massage. Which again wasn't as good as her deep tissue. Bit of a chat. She works there Sunday and another day in the other shop.

All up value for money. I left her 30 for the good massage and she offered me the usual water to go.

WIR? Maybe try a different shop next time.

They are offering a discount rate on the hour. So what ever you save on the swings, you loose on the roundabouts The no touching is a downer. She asked for 30. I have had others do it for $20.

I went here yesterday, partly to relax and partly to get out of the rain!
I saw Cindy, a very pretty, young and slim student from HK.
She wore a professional uniform and was very chatty and friendly and gave a decent, but a bit soft, massage.
No hint or offer of any extras and kept the old fella under the towel the whole time.
I doubt she'd be up for much, so I didn't bother asking.
A relaxing hour and great value at $59, but I doubt I'd rush back.
I saw the other masseur - a pretty pudgy Thai that had the "don't insult me by asking for extras" look
On the plus side, the masseurs are young, but for more I'd go elsewhere

Hi Nextlife
There wasn't anything sexual, hence no review
And the Thai masseur I saw had zero sex appeal.
Cheers

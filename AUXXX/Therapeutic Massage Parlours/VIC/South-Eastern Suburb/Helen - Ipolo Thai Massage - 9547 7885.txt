My experience/comments : I work up on a Sunday really out of kilter so after getting the family stuff out of the way, I ducked into here on the way through to do some errands.  I walked in without calling ahead and was me by Helen at the front desk.  I paid for a 45 minute hard massage and was led to a room to undress and get up on the table.  Helen returns and we exchange some pleasantries before she begins a very hard massage all over my back and even climbed up on the table to exert more pressure.  On the flip she makes the tug motion and holds up 5 fingers, I reply by holding up 3 fingers unless she wanted to go topless.  So began a fairly mechanical tug which had me over the line before too long.  So a clean up with hot towels and I was on my way with a complimentary bottle of water.

WIR - the hard massage was fantastic and I walked out of there feeling like a million dollars but the tug was meeh.

Yeah if you're not counting the mechanical tug then yeah pricey bottle of water.  It was a fairly warm Sunday though so maybe she was just considerate.

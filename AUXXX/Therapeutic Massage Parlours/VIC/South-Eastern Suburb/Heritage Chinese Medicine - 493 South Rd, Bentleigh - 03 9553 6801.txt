My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Have been eyeing this place off for a while. They have been advertising in the local paper for a while and i've driven past a few times. Gave them a call and she said pop staright in for a massage. I arrived and was greeted by Linda. (I'm sure she was there all alone).
Tells me to strip and start massaging. She put towell over my butt and i thought here we go. Kept massaging with no real signs of getting anywhere no matter how hard i tried. On the flip she covered me again. I thought oh well at least it was worth a try. She then said you have 15minutes left. Is there any spots that hurt needing special attention? I told her my right groin and my chest. Still nothing. She then asked straight out. Pointed at the old fella and said $30. I bargained her down to $20. She started rubbing away and phone started ringing. She had one hand on me and with the other was talking on the phone. I grabbed her butt a bit and had a good feel and got a bit of breast. I thought i had better not get to excited first time round and she stops altogether so i let her push me over the line.

All in all. Not a bad expeirience. I'm sure there is more to offer as 2 other callers rang asking about another girl that works there. Might have to return and investigate.

This place used top be connected to the establishment of the same name in Little Collins St (http://auxxxreviews.com/forum/f139/7...2-2772-a-7417/). Does anyone know if this is still the case and if Linda works in town?

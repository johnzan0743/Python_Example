Another review from my mobile sorry, I'll try to fix the template later, this is more of a warning though.

New place advertising in the Melbourne Leader, which can be accessed via a Google search for 'leader online'.

Can't remember her name but she was the owner and would be in her late 30's, Viet

Over the phone it was described as a body scrub ending with a sensual b2b slide guaranteed ending. Sounded awesome, $70 an hour + $30 for b2b

The scrub ended up being rubbed aggressively with one of those harsh exfoliation gloves and the b2b rub was her standing next to the table with her top pulled up exposing her tits bent over rubbing me. She did have great C/D cups though. Her excuse was that the door had no lock and didn't want to go naked.

Great idea but failed in the execution, hopefully they improve in time.

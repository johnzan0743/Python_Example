Just walked up to buy the newspaper, and was gobsmacked to see this new shop, a spa type massage shop, but fairly shady looking place to be honest. Had a look on google maps it used to be a hairdressers.  So now there are 4 shops within 100 odd metre's of Murrumbeena train station, obviously these shops are catering for the hard working Boom gate removal people, who will most likely not want to be seen walking into this kind of shop.

This is now an epidemic, they are popping up at a record rate now.  http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_2...rrumbeena.html

I have taken a look the last 2 days.  have met 3 girls, all around 25 all wearing dresses that are between sultry and conservative. Looks wise 6 out of 10.  This business has retained its hairdresser style, with 5 massage chairs and the work benches still in tact.Probably have not had time to destroy the old fabric of the joint.  A partition blocks the view of the hallway out the back to the table or tables.  This Saturday there was a papasan, with glasses and long hair tied back in a ponytail.  Good english and a man who seems to know what he is doing business wise.  The 2 girls on today were both going into bookings, so they are coping with the rush at this stage.

My experience/comments : 

Was in the area and thought I would try this place out. Dark reception area where the hairdresser used to be. At reception was Elissa. Average looking lady but very cheerful and welcoming. Unsure of her nationality as she has a unique look about her and I didn't ask. I thought she was just reception but she was the one doing the massage too. Wearing a short floral dress.  Owner with the ponytail was lurking around too and said hello.

Rooms were nice, ex-beauty therapy rooms so good size with a small basin in it. Has a "no sex" sign but other signs like tissues and cheap oil meant I could safely ignore that. Elissa walks in a minute after I'm laying down. Very friendly with lots of talking and asking me what I would like. Her English is perfect, to the extent I think she's actually born here. She only works here part time as she has another full time job but she makes as much money here in 2 days as she does in her full time job lol.

Massage was nice and relaxing which I asked for. I almost fell asleep a couple of times. Lots and lots of teasing before the flip. Little bot was ready to go in a very short period of time. Girl knows how to maximise her extras bonus payment.

Flip comes around and she asks for $30 tug. I couldn't argue so I agree. Slow sensual tug started up with lots of oil. I go around for a reach of her legs but she pulls away. I think it's off limits but no it's time for the upsell, another $20 for a topless tug which I agree. She takes off her dress and bra but leaves her black panties on and goes back to the tug. Lots of eye contact like she's enjoying it with a few moans when I play with her nipples. After a few minutes she starts a jackhammer though and gets me to cum pretty quickly. 

Cleans me up, kiss on the cheek and walks me out. Very nice girl but nothing overly special. She only works Fridays and Sundays.

On the way out there was a young but very chubby girl at reception so another miss there.

Just walked up to the shops and noticed this shop appears to be done.  No neon light flashing and the model picture on the window appears to be partly ripped.

They did offer extras. The extras were pricey and the women were average, but extras could be had...

Seems every group of shops in melbs now has a few very budget pop-up shops that only last six months before they close again...

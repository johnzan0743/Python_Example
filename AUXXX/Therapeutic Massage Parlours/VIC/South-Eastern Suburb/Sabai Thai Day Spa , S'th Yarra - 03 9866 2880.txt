Very tired and busy at work so decided to give this place a go. Made a call and she told me I could just go there whenever.
Very cold day, and as I entered it was nice and warm. The lady took me the room and asked me to get ready! I usually leave undies on! Nancy came in, not much of a chatter but friendly enough to ask how you were and about your day and stuff! Then she covered my body with cloth and gave it a gentle massage! After 10 min or so she started giving me oil massage. She left undies on and would only take that piece of cloth from area she was massaging. Her massage skills are excellent. I asked her if she had some training in Thailand and she said she started working as a massage lady in Australia only! Her massage skills are very good but also very professional! Really keep distance and nothing sensual/teasing/accidental touching etc.

After 40 min, she asked me to flip. Upon flip she again put cloth on me to cover and gave me a good leg massage. About 10 min to go and absolutely no sign of anything else on offer, I asked the question if she could massage there! (@!@) She was quite for a few seconds, then she said $50. I had no money that evening and said only have $20. Then she said $30. I said had only $20. She kept massaging me and after couple of min I asked again, not for $20, I would come back!
She asked me to keep quite as she might get in trouble is someone overhears something! Then she gave me slow HJ. She stood at distance so- no touching!! Overall- good massage, good HJ! Not too pricey, for south yarra!

G'day folks, was driving down behind Moorabbin Train station, near the Safeway, in a little side street called Tuck street and noticed a new "Massage" place had opened up... Wondering if anyone had been in yet? If I get the chance I'll wonder in and see what the dealio is.

Made an appointment after NYE for double massage! Went in there and only 2 girls were working! The girl at reception said they were busy so won't be able to do 4 hands!
Went into massage room where there is a sing says 'Leave you underwear on'! So I did! And then the girl walks in ask if I would like to take it off! (A nickle for every time that happens!) 

She was very quite! Not much talking! Her massage was very average! Medium pressure with no teasing or any sensual signs! Usually on events like this; I just let it pass by because tugs become very mechanical and you they they wont be enthusiastic and will put good effort into it! That's exactly what happened after I asked for it! $20 extra for HJ and absolutely no touching!

WIR: not bad experience but not great either!

Went for standard massage, nice clean place and girls are helpful. 

Girl met me at door, she was under 5 foot tall and very cute. Went for the 1 hour massage. 

I Stripped off and she gave a nice massage, but noticed that most of the massage focused on top of my legs, bottom of my back and ass. There was not too much of a full body massage. She did not speak much english, but eventually I flipped over and asked for more of a full massage and for her to give the R&T, she had no problem, $20 for R&T and extra $10 for touching her, but she only allowed the top off, but happy to have tits sucked and licked. She appear to enjoy and the R&T took ages and she kept stopping and taking her time...nice.

Will go back, other girls were there, but did not see them.

Visited 8 / 3 Tuck St Moorabbin this morning. Place is ok - not the worst not the best. room solid walls to roof but a simple curtain for door.
$60 for 45 mins.
Got sweet looking young girl (Kelly I think but could be nellie or something else). Massage was very ordinary - all elbows and uneven pressure basically no idea. Avoided the never region like I'd never washed whilst on tummy and same on the flip. Asked the question and got a stern NO as if I'd asked to fuck her up the arse.
Anyway will not return. There were other girls there so maybe someone else has a better time of it.

Cheers

very ordinary massage there this morning. nice enough looking young asian but got that feeling from the outset knowing good was going to come of this. took 45mins for $60. rooms are fine but with a curtain not door. can hear other rooms - and had to smile as the other bloke also getting no joy. asked the question but knew the answer.
her massage was all elbows and forearms. thought ordinary at the time but as I type this I feel pretty good - or was that the great RnT I got at Nepean on way home

I wonder if these places offer a few hand-jobs to get punters excited and tell their mates? Then resort to basic crap massage when business gets busier!

Person's Name : Gina / Gianzhou

Establishment : 8/3 Tuck St Moorabbin

Date of Visit : 22/04/13

Address: 8/3 Tuck St, Moorabbin
Contact Details: Ph:9532 3760

Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm

Rates : 30mins / $75 massage / 50 for the massage +25 for the tug

Age : 20..ish

Size/shape : 8 ... petite 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Said Japanese but my bullshit detector says Chinese (I could be wrong though)

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Value for money: just      Recommended: yes

My experience/comments : Been a long time between drinks when it comes to visiting an AMP for a R&T.
Had never visited this place before so turned up unannounced not knowing if it was a legit place or the kind of place I was looking for.
As soon as I entered I knew I was most likely in the right place.

Was asked how long I wanted to stay and was given prices.
Paid my 50 for a half hour and was shown to the room by a plump Chinese lass and told to undress and jump on the table.

The plump Chinese girl disappeared and the attractive and petite Gina entered. Suddenly I was feeling pretty good about things.
She asked if I would like it firm, medium or soft for my massage. 
Once I gave my answer as soft she must have known what I was there for as 75% of the massage that followed concentrated on my inner thighs, lower back, arse crack and ball sack.

After turning and getting my first really good look at Gina I saw she has a cute face, wonderfully shaped ass and small well shaped titties .
She had no complaints about my hand running over that ass of hers.
Gina asked if I would like to have my cock tugged. Silly question really. Does anyone say 'no thanks' to that question?

Paid her 25 for the extra and she got to work on my erection as my hand worked its way inside her top to play with two lovely firm breasts.
Happy days indeed as I reached completion.
Nice banter during the clean up and I left with a smile on the dial and a spring in my step.

Gina works mainly weekends plus Monday & Tuesday.

Person's Name : Alice

Establishment : 3/8 Tuck Street Moorabbin

Date of Visit : 6th June 2013 (Thursday)

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 3/8 Tuck Street

Hours of Business : 10-8.30 Mon-Fri, 10-7.30 Sat

Rates : $50 half hour massage, $30 happy ending

Age : Approx 20-24

Size/shape : 5'5 hard to say about body because of baggy clothing but body was ok 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Taiwanese

Services Provided : r&t

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : I read a short review about this place which mentioned a "hot young Thai girl". As I was in the area I decided to drop and check it. Despite all of the advertisement regarding rates for shoulders, legs back etc all the girl asked me was how long I wanted to stay for. She wasn't the most welcoming girl and proceeded to take my $50 and show me to a small but tidy room. Once undressed she returned to the room to commence a very light massage which was very uninspiring and lasted for 12 minutes. Once on my back she massaged my legs very quickly and then offered hand relief for $30. I asked her to remove her all covering jumper but she flatly declined and touching was off limits. Overall I won't bother returning, I had higher expectations. I can find better places to do $80 in 25 minutes.

Went in there yesterday in fact... $50 for half an hour. No other questions asked. Terrible massage...Actually it was kinda non existent as when she started she stood over my head and was just running her fingernails over me, so i put my hands up her dress and it was on after that.. She got nude.. Good tug... Bit of finger banging. Bit of an old duck, but it's what the doc ordered.

MelbDude, who did you see? Without a name your comments are not much use to punters as some have had good experiences so obviously varies with the girl.

See, all it takes is a bit of kindness and you're off to the races.

Now if you'd only filled in the blanks in the review template, everyone would be cheering.

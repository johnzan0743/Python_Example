Found an ad on Locanto for a full body massage in Dandenong done by 38 year old asian lady, so made a booking yesterday arvo.Lady's name is Katie and she looks more like 48 with just an average looking face & body. Massage was pretty average too, although cheap at $60 per hour. Offered a Linford Christie at end of massage for an extra $20, which I declined.WIR? Doubt it.

Rates :
$60/hour; $30/30minutes

Age : Late 30's

Size/shape : Ok, a little pudgy, nice breasts

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : RT, topless

Value for money/recommend? : Not bad

I came here a month ago and got an older (as in 50+!) Chinese lady who gave me a nice deep tissue massage, but nothing else. I caught a glimpse of Katie and thought she looked pretty good for a Chinese milf, so thought I'd visit her on another day.

Txted her last week and made appointment, rocked up (It's up the stairs in Vanity Plaza off Thomas St Dandenong, paid and laid naked on the bed. Katie comes back and gives me a decent rub down, good pressure, and with 30min to go flipped me over. Was offered topless HJ for $30; she took her top off and I kinda regretted it - she has large breasts but a bit of tummy, plus I'm a CFNM fan so probably better her top stayed on. She begins a nice sensual HJ, lots of variety in pressure and speed, even try to finger my date but I wasn't in the mood. She does get into it a bit - a bit of bad acting on her part but better then a cold distant bitch. Deed done, wiped me up and left with a smile. She did mention that she works alone on Mon and Wed and that I can get as "noisy" as I want on those days. Not sure if there's more on offer, might find out next time I'm in the area.

All in all a better then avg punt. WIR? If I'm in the area and need a cheap tug, why not? But Helen at Tennyson Ave in Clayton is much hotter.

Value for money/recommend? : Was something different, OK if you like older lady.

My experience/comments : Ok, well i had bit of time on hands and was in the area, so decided to go check this out after seeing ad on GT and here with little info in hand, First of this place is hard to find, make sure you read the GT ad to get full details of where to go, Nothing is signed, no Open light out front, just a door and a bell.  I would advise that you call before hand, but on the upper level of building, outside the place is bit of dump, but she has spent some money to make the room look ok, Nice heating and electric blanket on massage table, Very nice lady to talk too, but is older, Massage was pretty good but little bit too much finger nails used at times (for me anyway). She asked on flip anywhere i didnt want touched, i said no all over is fine, which she replied extra 30 for the little guy. Hands can wonder, but i think i caught her at the wrong time of month to find out if anything more on offer, so just settle for the HJ.  she liked to tackle that with both hands ;-), Ad said shower is provided but i just settled for more of a rub down with hot towel. All in all Ok exp, out of area for return trip.  She said she other girl working there, but because it quite she said for her to have day off.  If anyone to comment on her let the team know.  Enjoy. ....

Ok - after a little trip overseas and some time off I decided to go for a rub.  Massage was average at best - not terrible but I've had plenty better.  HJ once again was ok but nothing magnificent.  Plenty of better opportunities out there although it was cheap.

What type of massage was it? what was her technique like?

What does Katie look like? I mean other than her size 10 body shape?

Simple, so other punters can know more information as they might want to give her a go.

After all, just cos 1 punter didn't like the massage, doesn't mean everyone else wont also. Each punter is different.

Well if that is your aim and you wish to apply "some balance" why don't you go and see the provider and make a full Review (but without any explicit indication of unlicenced activities) instead of just asking questions.

Person's Name : kayo

Establishment : shop 33 vanity court Dandenong 

Date of Visit : 7/1/15

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : locanto

Hours of Business : 10-8

Rates : $40-30 mins + extras

Age : 32

Size/shape : 5ft2" size 8-10

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

Services Provided : massage hj

Value for money/recommend? : yes

My experience/comments : 
After a dud punt at nature care in narre warren that left me a bit toey, I did a search on locanto hoping to find somewhere close that would relieve me of some build up. This place had a few ads there with their address so I decided to call in off the street and try my luck.

The shop is located in a shopping mall type of place, fairly easy to find in Thomas st Dandenong. Now outside this place is pretty shabby, there's no signs just a door bell to press in arrival, which I did.
The door is opened by a gorgeous looking asian girl who asks me if I'd like a massage, yes of course. Now I'm  really hoping it's her that'll be doing the massage, I'm shown to the room and asked to strip.

The room was pretty dirty, carpets filthy but the towel on the table appeared to be fresh and kayo did place a fresh disposable paper around the face hole and one in the middle when the tackle will rest. It was a 37c day and there's was no AC, just a fan blowing warm air around which wasn't ideal, but it wasn't too uncomfortable. I nude up and lie down waiting. In comes the gorgeous girl and I'm in luck, she's my masseuse. 

Kayo was a very pleasant and cheerful ml from japan, she is advertised as being 26 but told me that she's actually 32, I found this hard to believe as she looked around 22 to me, beautiful toned body and very nice face, looked like c cup tits but they stayed covered so hard to tell.

I asked for a firm massage and received a vary good one at that, there was no touching of the goods though, she left the room and came back with a hot wash tub, wiped my back with a nice hot towel and asked me to flip. I glanced at the clock and it had been 25mins out if my 30 so I asked about extras. She said hj for 30, I responded with $50 to removed the kit as I was very keen to get a look at what she looked like under her shorts and blouse, but she said no, $30 it was then. She oiled me up and started a very nice slow rub, I asked her if it was ok to touch her, she said a little bit was ok. I rubbed her arse and back, couldn't reach her tits so didn't try. By now she had me hard, working me up with two hands, balls getting attention too, she seemed to be enjoying herself too as she had a smile on her face. I went under her shorts and continued rubbing her arse, on top of her satin panties, reached a bit further under for some pussy but she told me not there. I didn't push it and went back to enjoying her full and toned rear end. She got me over the line soon after, probably stop a little too quick but it was still a very nice hj.

She cleaned me up with great detail, and as I was getting dressed, asked me to return again.

WIR: Yes for sure, kayo was a pleasure to be with and look at and gave a decent massage too

Person's Name : Katie.

Establishment : My Space massage, Suite 33 / 200 Thomas St. Dandenong

Date of Visit : 2nd Jan 2015

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Various ads. Hes'a a locanto one: http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_3...Dandenong.html

Hours of Business : 9:30am to 7pm Monday to Saturday; 10am to 6pm Sunday

Rates : $70/hour; $50/45minutes; $40/30minutes

Age : 40+

Size/shape : 10 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Full Body Massage + HJ ($30 Extra)

Value for money/recommend? : No, below average value.

Gave this place a try last week. Called first and makde sure there was a spot available. Katie was there - one of the other girls didn't show up so she was doing the massage. I booked 30 mins. Vanity Court is a dive of a place, her room is right up the top floor (up the ramp and then up the stairs). Leads you to a corridor with a bunch of numbered rooms, no signs. I knocked on door 33 and Katie ushered me in. She's definitely more than the advertised 40 on Locanto. Pleasant enough looking but not enough to get you over the line if that sort of thing is important to you.

She ushers me into the massage room which is not too bad. At least it was painted and the towels looked fresh. I hand her the cash and she then starts with the 20 questions about how I found her. Told her a friend recommended her and made up a name. The massage wasn't great.. Not enough pressure even after I asked her to step it up. Plus she was trying to locate the girl that didn't turn up and kept getting SMS's throughout. I think she was distracted by this - but honestly I don't think it would have mattered.

Came the flip and asked if I wanted a whole body massage, and did my friend tell me what the costs were. Yep no problem, go for it.

The tug was pretty bad for someone with as much experience as her. She was like a hammer drill. Cleanup wasn't great either. She wanted $30 foe the extras.

There are 3 other girls working for her though, so might be worth checking them out. She also said she's expanding into the room next door too, so things must be going ok for her. I may give it another go to see another girl at some point, but I would not go back for a massage with her.

Hours of Business : 

Rates : $70 Per hour

Age : 25 ish

Size/shape : Fit

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

Services Provided : Massage, hj

Value for money/recommend? : Ok


 This venue advertises fairly extensively on Locanto, and is located in a heritage listed building in Dandenong. Which nowadays looks pretty seedy.

Only one ML available and that was Yui, from Japan, mid twenties, attractive and with long red hair. (Not natural I'm guessing).

Yui has reasonable English, and we had a good old chat. Her massage skills are good too. Good coverage of my back, shoulders and legs. On the flip, I asked about extras, and she didn't say no straight away, but seemed reluctant to say yes. In the end she agreed to a hj for $30, and with reasonable skills got me over the edge pretty quickly. She kept out of groping range, but in all these things YMMV.

Will I return. Not for Yui, as she told me she is moving on soon....don't know where to though, but, if in the area again, probably would to see who else is available.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Japanese

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 
I had finished work local to My Space on a particular stressful afternoon where I felt the need to destress so called on 0431156192 where it rang out but the call was immediately returned.  Inquired about a massage and was told to turn up in 15 minutes, I arrived at the agreed time and ringing the bell was let in by mamasan who inquired if I had been there before and leading me to a sitting area behind a screen.  I initially had booked for 60 minutes but she was adamant the only ML on could only do 45 minutes.  So whatever, paid her and met by Misha who I can describe as quite attractive in skin tight white jeans and a typical females top and led next door to the other suite and into a massage room.  She left me to disrobe and lay on the towel covered table before returning a couple of minutes later.  She showed genuine interest to look over my extensive body art before draping me with a hot towel, her english is not extensive and I found I had to repeat myself a bit.  She begins quite a good massage on the back, arms, legs and butt.  My only criticism was I requested a firm massage and her firm would be what I call a medium pressure.  It was quite good however so doesn't detract from the experience. just before the flip she wipes me down with a hot towel and I inquire about extras.   She states she only does tugs but allows some touching and holds up 3 fingers.  After oiling me over my chest and legs, she commences a slow oily tug with one hand while fondling the balls with the other.  She was fine with touching her butt under the jeans which was an effort to get a hand into and some light rubbing of the cat through her G and her jeans but seemed to shy away from touching her rack.  She got me over the edge and kept the motion going so that the significant load I'd blown rolled down my waist and on to the towel.  After a clean up with tissues, she finishes off with a massage on the legs until the end of time where again she wipes me down with a hot towel and I dress and bid her farewell.

WIR - Maybe, I wouldn't mind trying someone else though I would book with Misha again.

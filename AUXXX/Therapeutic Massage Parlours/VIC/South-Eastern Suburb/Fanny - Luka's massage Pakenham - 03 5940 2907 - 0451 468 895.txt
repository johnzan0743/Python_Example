My experience/comments : 
I came across this place accidentally, Luka's is very close to where I live and I have walked past it many times before, I've also done a Google search on it and found it to be totally legit. 
I went there this day because my back had been killing me and I wanted a quality massage, extras weren't even on my mind. I walk in and am greeted by an older Asian lady, she asked how long , 30 mins I said, explaining that I had a bad back. Was shown to a small but clean room. Now I wasn't sure if I was meant to go nude for a legit massage or not, so I just went with what I know and nuded up. I never even looked if tissues were visible or not.
So in comes Fanny, she was a different girl to the first, she was wearing a nice cotton top with thick black leggings , appeared to have a nice shape. She starts the massage, I fill her in about my back issue and she concentrates on there. Now this was a first rate firm massage, exactly what I was after, she rubbed the neck a bit too and also my legs, all the while we had a nice conversation, her English was quite good. So after around 20 mins had past, I felt her graze my sac, thinking did I just imagine that? Then she did a few more times, ok definitely not an accident. I was shocked because like I said this place checked out as full legitimate. She kept going and Jnr  had started to show some excitement, then fanny left the room to go and get a hot towel, I figured that might be it, had a look around, noted the lock on the door and the tissues. 
Fanny came back and gave my a wipe down with the hottest towel of all time! Then asked me to flip, starts to rub my legs but before long she points to my cock and asks if I want? Yep ok let's do it, I was told $30, I never asked for anything else so I'm not sure how far she would go. Fanny was a very nice lady but sadly when she started the tug, it appeared that this was part of the job was something she didn't enjoy, she went all serious and mechanical, made no eye contact, just stared at the wall. Her tug was actually pretty good though, two hands and rubbed the balls as well, I didn't push the limits, only rubbing her arse on the outside of her pants. It took her a while but she finished me off, a bit over time too. She cleaned me up and I was on my way.

WIR: The massage was fantastic, but I probably won't go back, mainly because it's too close to home for me, although I doubt too many locals know it's an r&t shop.

I live in SouthGippsland and often use Luka's as a "pit stop" if I'm on the way home from the city. I've never come across (pun intendid) Fanny but have often enjoyed the services of Jes. A nice little chinese milf that does a passable massage and a jack hammer hand job but she's very liberal with her body dfk hand up the pussy stuff like that. Like a lot of these people though when I've suggested nude or fs she suddenly seems not to understand english so well. Another one is Leesa though not sure if she is still there but she would do nude body slides for 40 bucks.But no kissing. Great place for a small country town.

Services Provided : Massage, hj, pussy play

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : I haven't had a lot of time to punt of late, but this day I had a window of opportunity. I just needed something easy and quick, so I headed to this place as it's close to home.
I walk in and am met by an older Asian woman, guessing in her 40's, not a glamour but pleasent at the same time. I have her $50 for 30 mins , she showed me to the room while she went to get some change. 
So Jess returned and asked me if I wanted hard medium or soft, I wasn't interested in a "massage ", so I chose soft. I think Jess knew exactly what I was looking for.
So with quite a lot of oil, she starts on my back, but within 2 minutes she was rubbing my arse and sac with each stroke. I showed her my approval by giving her more access. There wasn't a lot of chat, even though her English was quite good, I was just loving the way she continued to tease me. 
Time came to flip, there had been no conversation about extras, no mention of $$. Jess oiled up my hardon and began a really good two handed hj, Jess was wearing a short skirt, so I rubbed her bum before pushing my luck and rubbing her covered pussy. There was no objection from her, in fact she seemed to like it, so I then went under the panties, found her button and some moisture, put the two together and Jess was very happy. 
After that it didn't take long for me to explode with a big load. 
Jess gave me a great clean up with a hot towel before I got dressed. I have her a tip which made her happy and after a kiss and a cuddle, I left.

WIR: Yes, I think return visits with this lady could be very beneficial. She works Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at this shop, but mentioned that they now have another shop across the road, in Trelor Ln which she works at on Thursday and Friday

 TL : DR - Engaging throughout the whole session and happy to tease-play with a great massage to start and then finish 

Had a casual meeting with a client in the morning in the area and decided to fire up the reviews to see what was around. Kudos to Tripod for the update and wanted to check out their other venue.

But there are two choices on Treloar Lane. One was the pink-emblazoned shopfront in the lane itself and the other was in the arcade, linking Treloar Lane and Main Street. Ended up at Luka's for a sure bet and the lady who greeted me was asking if I was there for the haircut or a massage? 

It turns out that the sister shop is in the arcade (JC Massage, 0481 266081 Shop 3, 156 Main St, Pakenham) with the green signage. Opted for the half-hour massage and the lady mentioned that her name was JC and that shop was hers, running things at Luka's today. I think this is the older lady that was described in the previous review but it suited me just fine, with a tight black lace/t-shirt top and grey pleated miniskirt.

Latch-door-lock and box of tissues as described with financials to be settled later, nuded up and on the table. Asked for a soft massage, which she replied coyly "of course" with lots of oil that was quite sensual with ball-caresses (met with raised hips and spread legs for her to better access). 

After asking, my hands found their way on her smooth legs, then testing the boundaries as they wandered beyond the hem of her skirt. She parted slightly for better access, to allow me to rub her through her underwear, before being encouraged to pull aside and starting to tease her with my fingers.

I could only flip for a great two-hand HJ, varying with speed and twists from a skilled operator who looked me in the eyes to make sure I was enjoying it, occasionally closing them with a gasp with my attentions as well. A well-shot load, with her leaving her hands as I subsided and a "good boy, that was good" for encouragement before a hot towel clean and two glasses of chilled water.

But we weren't done yet. With 15 minutes on the clock, I was down for a more professional back/shoulder/leg deep tissue massage, which was excellent.

All the oil was cleaned with three hot towels, which was the only time that she left the room. Settled afterwards with a quick hug and peck on the cheek before I was sent into the lunchtime rush of Main Street. It's a bit of a hike out to Pakenham for me, but something to keep in mind should I ever find my way out there once more.

Melchior, Jess told me the new shop was the pink building in trelor lane. Jc is a different shop as far as I know. It's all a bit confusing, I hope to check out the pink shop soon so I'll post the results

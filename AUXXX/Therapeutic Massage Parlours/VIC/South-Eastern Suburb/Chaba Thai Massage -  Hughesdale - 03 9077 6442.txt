My experience/comments : Had walked past this place a few times going to station. Business looks legitimate but thought I'd try it out to see what happens.

Walked in and place looked very clean. Was greeted at front counter by young thai girl asking what I"d like. I said I'd like 1 hour oil massage and was told to wait. After 5 minutes, was told to come through to room and take off all clothes but leave underpants on. I had a fair idea straight away that not much would be offered here.

Laid down on table and put towel over myself. After 5 or so minutes a young thai girl came in. I must admit, probably one of the prettiest massage therapists I've had. I asked her name and we had some small talk.

She started massaging my feet which was nice and then moved on to back using oil. Massage was excellent - a lot softer than what I"m used to but very very relaxing and enjoyable. She climbed on bed and performed excellent massage for around 15 minutes, before working legs. Never any hint of anything else.

She then asked me to flip over and kept towel strategically in place. Again great massage over top half of body and legs. i didn't want to ask for anything else as there was never any hint of anything, business was clean and legitimate and I didn't want to embarass myself.

Overall i was really happy with massage. It's a pity she didn't offer anything else as she was very pretty and I probably would have blown my load in a couple of minutes! Would definitely recomment this place (and this girl in particular) if you're just after a nice massage.

Chaba is very legit and the undies are nearly aways on. When a girl trusts you she will pull them down only to get the elbows and forearms on your bum for a legit rub.

Boss Natasha is very strict with the girls.

Been there as well. No hint of any extras. Great massage, nice facilities but nothing else on offer. There is another one a little further down next to the pizza shop on the corner. Been there and had success numerous times. Not the best looking girls but who is to complain.

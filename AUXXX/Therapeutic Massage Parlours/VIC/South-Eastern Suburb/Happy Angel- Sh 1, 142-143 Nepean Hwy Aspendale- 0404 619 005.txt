First time I have visited this shop, and met at the door by Judy. She looked very striking in her tight leather trousers and bright yellow top. Booked for 30 minutes and was shown into a room, stripped and got onto the table.

Judy, returned and proceeded to give quite a good massage. I think she is a relative beginner, but is doing everything right, and with a bit more experience will be very good masseuse. Her English isn't too bad either. Unfortunately she was keeping well out of groping range, and her hands went no where near my naughty bits. Just prior to the flip, however, she started getting a bit more adventurous, and I was now thinking "game on". On the turnover, with my old fella standing proudly to attention, I popped the question and Judy indicated HJ for $50. Sorry fellow punters, I know I should have negotiated, but I did like Judy, and felt like rewarding her amply so I agreed. Can't comment much about her skills here, as I had a weeks load on board, and came very quickly. Bugger....should have negotiated a lower price.

Will I return, and is more on offer? I would definitely like to return, as Judy is a very attractive and pleasant young lady. I doubt if more is on offer, but who knows, YMMV.

[Pulls out local paper] Not sure, but guessing address is wrong. More likely Koh Feel Wellbeing massage shop - what are the chances of there being two massage shops in Oakleigh both with a street number of 14? Plus George St isn't near the station. Perhaps move it to that thread there unless OP can confirm otherwise.

It's a mystery and golferrob hasn't tried to clarify his post.
14 George St is a private house
14a Atherton Rd is Koh Feel Thai Massage
14 Station St is a hairdresser
Well, in any case golferrob got as much
as he gave to this post ( nothing)

He says it's a shop front in the original post so probably not George St if George is a house.

I wonder how $75/45 minutes without apparently even a tug could be good value!

I'm confused now different sites give different names and phone numbers but it was 79a Herbert st. Same operator must have a few sites . I know Heatherton rd is non sexual if you can get a booking...it's all part of the punt,bit of research

I wonder if it's the same place on Heatherton road we are talking about. A house with a hall way that runs the length of the house with about 8 private rooms?  Parking out front and out back. I saw an Alicia there once, nothing but a massage unfortunately.

I visited this place (Herbert st) this afternoon. I went in the door and greeted by the main lady told be to wait in the room and asked what type of massage I was after.
I told her relaxation. She sent Chloe in to massage me. When Chloe arrived I was still getting changed and she said to make sure I have the towel covering my privates. 
:-( Maybe I was in the wrong place...I noticed that she gave me a few brushes on the tackle when she was doing my legs...so when it came time to flip over I asked if she did any extra's. She replied with a firm "No". :-(
She then went on to tell me that the police had been by to ask them they were offering hand relief and that there was no way she was going to risk it. :-(

Has anyone been there recently? Maybe I should ask for a different girl....or maybe they have gone legit.

Thanks,
Pjur.

I went and saw Chloe yesterday afternoon. But when I asked for extra's she replied with a firm No. Has anyone else had any luck?

Pretty sure this place is legit. Visited as I was in the area, got naked and laid on the table. Nancy came in and gave me a sensual relaxation massage. A lot of sensual massaging of thighs/inner thighs but no where near the boys. She's a hot euro/latina milf but unfortunately when I asked for extras she said no. She's the owner and says everything here is strictly legit (well, not Chloe...at least for a while) as she is going for "long term".

Nice massage but no dice. Boo.

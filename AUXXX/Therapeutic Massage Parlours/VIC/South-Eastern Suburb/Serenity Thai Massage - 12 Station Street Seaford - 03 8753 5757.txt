Person's Name : Zsuzsa (Suzi)

Establishment : Serenity Thai Massage - 12 Station Street Seaford - direct phone to ML 0402818944

Date of Visit : May 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : https://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_...i-Massage.html.

Rates : $80/h

Age : 37

Size/shape : Very nice womanly shape (~size 12, D cup natural)

Nationality or Ethnicity : Aussie (Hungarian)

Services Provided : Lomi Lomi / Bodyslide ($70 extra)

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

As I noted there, Suzi (Zsuzsa) advertises privately on Locanto https://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_...i-Massage.html. When I contacted her (following a tip from another punter) she replied that she actually worked at the Serenity shops at Seaford (Friday) and Heatherton (Mon - Wed) but specifically asked that I book direct through her on her mobile.

Zsuzsa uses a large piece of heavy vinyl over the standard shop table and uses quite a lot of oil (thankfully water-based so it cleans off quite well). I upgraded from the standard Lomi Lomi to a near nude (small G-string) body slide and found it was very worth the extra investment. If you do spend a session with her, expect to be "under direction" to some extent; "move your arms to the side of the table", "move left" legs apart" etc, so that the potential too much free range hunting is somewhat restricted. (YMMV, but in my case her directions turned rather more advantageous as the session proceeded). 

As she slid sensually across my back, she nuzzled my neck in a very pleasant fashion and this, combined with some delightful under-carriage work put me in an excellent mood for the flip which proceeded to a very satisfactory conclusion.

At the conclusion, she brings hot water and towels for a thorough wash and towel down, first on the table and then standing on a towel and turning as asked (a little like the school nurse giving you a physical but nevertheless, very nice).

As a caveat, I would strongly suggest that you take the time to contact and establish a relationship with the lady prior to the booking in order to maximise your mileage. I could imagine that an unscheduled request at the shop may result in a standard clothed Lomi Lomi only being offered.  All up, I feel this lady is a real find, especially if (or once) you find the "right wavelength".

Thanks Jassyhub for providing the correct links (and if you Google ZsuZsa massage you will find this and another one on Gumtree). She seems to work 4 days a week at the two shops - under this name (but is perhaps known in the shop by the Anglicized version - Suzi).

Bill would one of those shops be a very legit appearing salon aimed at Female Clientelle? Shape your body clinic?

The Gumtree ad link would be great if it's still current thanks.

I went back for a second course of La Zsuzsa and I must say it was exquisite. If any of you good gentlemen had the fortune to sample Ms Lauren in Cheltenham a few years back, this is a younger, prettier version with similar performance. Well worth a try.

A quick heads up. To use a good tradie expression, Zsuzsa is "going off the tools" at the end of September. She is taking a job as manager of a new legit Japanese massage shop in North Rd Ormond. So for those of you who have already enjoyed her exquisite skills (and those who would like to) you have three weeks to get yourself down to Seaford (where La Zsuzsa is working Mon to Fri). Suggest you text her directly on 0402818944.

Contacted her last week and she indicated she was now offering legit Lomi Lomi (and will be managing a legit shop from next month). Sad news after 3 of the best sessions in my punting career

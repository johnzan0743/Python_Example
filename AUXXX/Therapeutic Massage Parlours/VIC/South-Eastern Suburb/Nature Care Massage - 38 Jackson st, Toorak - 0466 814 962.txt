[COLOR=#333333]Saw ad on gumtree first so decided to visit on Wed evening. Called them and they said ok come in, but after 20 min when I got there, the lady at reception asked me to come back in half hour as they were busy. I said I called before and was told ok to walk in for 4 hands massage, now she says for 4 hands come back in hour. I said i would book some other time. Next day texted to make booking for Fri. Went there Fri, I think Vivian runs business and usually on the front desk answering calls etc. She took me to the room near to the entrance. Its just curtain around, no wall, so you can hear everything that is going around. Shortly after my massage started Vivian left to answer call.

he came back shortly after and apologized. Anyways, the massage was good, not too soft or hard, just medium and little sensual but not obvious hints etc. I never had 4 hands massage before. It was very relaxing. After 40 min was flip. After sometime she asked me if I was looking for something more, and if I wanted massage 'there'. I asked for extra $$ and she said $30 each. Went for single therapist HJ. Tina gave me really good hj, slow and soft. No touching any of them, after a bit job done. Cleaned me with hot towel wipe down. I don't think they were very clean or dry enough before they used them on me, but anyways, had good massage and left relaxed. WIR=yes.[/COLOR]

Good review Kenchan.

Mods, phone number in the title doesn't work and is different to the one in Locanto ad. should be 841 not 814. So correct number is 0466 841 962.

So texted again for booking and got prompt reply. I went in there. The shop is tiny and have done some renovation. They used to have curtain only but now there are tiny rooms. I guess there are 3 massage rooms. Seems to be clean, they use disposable sheets on massage table. 

Vivian is Chinese, in 30s, with average body size (not fat but not skinny either) and not bad looking either. She same in and kept asking me if I wanted other massage girl, and other girls seems to be very young in 20s with bit of an attitude, whilst Vivian seems friendly.

Hopped on the massage table and she started the massage. Felt a bit rushed and the strokes were fast, after 35 min, was asked to flip. It wasn't much of sensual teasing etc. Upon flips, she asked if I wanted extra, she quoted $30 for HJ. Took HJ option, she gave me HJ. Was OK HJ, she grabbed on too tight and bit fast, asked her to make it slow and relaxed, she did for a 30 seconds and then back to how it was. Job done!! WIR =  Maybe.

My experience/comments :I went to have a look at this place today. I had been once before 12 months or so ago.
It is small and neat 2 or 3 rooms floor to ceiling walls 
( used to be curtain walls. ). Door opened by a slender Chinese lady in her early 30s,  no great looker but ok.
She was working on her own ,showed me to a room "massage ,how long?"There was something about her that I thought she may be worth a go.
I took 1 hr at $70. She was finishing another punter ; so I undressed and waited .There was no cover towel (a good sign). 
It was about 10 minutes before she returned . I lay down , no jocks and she went to table head and proceeded with a fairly basic massage of my shoulders . I had my hands over the table top and she lightly pushed her crotch into them as she went , so I started to stroke her legs and butt outside the dress. I could feel she was wearing a g string.

She finally got off the shoulders after too long and mediocre quality, pushing and poking .

I tried to start up some conversation but realized she understood almost no English.

She started to brush the crack ,a god sign and on the legs pushed the side of her hands up in the sac as she progressed.

On the flip her hands went straight to cover junior and she held up 3 fingers to indicate a price.

I indicated BJ ,and the answer was a negative shake of the head. I indicated clothes off and 5 fingers was the response.
So $50'for nude HJ and away she went.
 When her flimsy dress came off it showed a nice neat figure , medium boobs and firm neat arse smooth skin.
She let me run my hands over her boobs and arse and down over a trimmed bush and stroking the outside lips .

She was a bit jack hammer at first until I told her to slow down her double handed strokes .She lifted one knee up on the table to access the puss and settled into a nice varied pace. Soon over the line , a wash down and all good.

She only works Saturday.I don't think there is anything extra other than what she gave me 

She was very keen to get me back, so I guess business is quiet here.

It was a moderate punt and no real complaints but nothing memorable either.it was "ok".

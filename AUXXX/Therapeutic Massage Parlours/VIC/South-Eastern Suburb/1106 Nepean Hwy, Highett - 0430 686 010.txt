My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)
After missing out at Station st and running out of time, i thought i would try 1106 Nepean Hwy. I walked in and was greeted by a fairly nice looking Asian bird. She asked if i wanted massage and if i had been here before. I said yes of course and she told me to wait 10 minutes. By now i was getting edgy as i was on a tight schedule.
She took me through and asked me to pay up front. I gave her $50.00 and she said she told me to get undressed and she would be back. (I didn't bother asking for change)

She started massaging my shoulders and neck and i could hear her moaning and rubbing her pussy on my head. I knew now i was in business from the word go. She then started massaging my legs, inner thigh and crack. She started reaching for my balls so i arched my back and gave her more room. 

She had a bit of a play and asked me to turn over. She went to work on me and i got a grab of her arse and tried to grab her pussy. Tehre was no resistance except when i tried to get inside she said she had her period. I dropped her top, sucked her nipples a bit. She kept playing so i thought, stuff it why resist. I let go and dropped cream on her hand. She had no tissues in the room which was funny. She came back and cleaned me up a little and walked back out. I got dressed and got the hell out of there.

"Didn't ask or get told"? Why not ask if you knew you were going to do a review?

A review without a name has limited value. All it tells me is that there is a PRC girl at 1106 Nepean who gives a tug so if I go there, I am still taking pot luck as other girls may not do it.

As I said it was all rather rushed. She was doing something in the other room and told me to wait 10 minutes. Didn't have any chit chat at all. Just straight into it with no questions asked.

Nobody is forcing you to go there just sharing my punt.

It was weird as. Hardly massaged at all. Worked well for me as I was in a real rush as I posted earlier because was on a tight schedule. Went to station st and wasted time there visiting two places there with no luck. That's when I went to  nepean. Massage was probably only 5 minutes worth so can't really judge. As I said she started massaging my legs, grabbed my balls and started reaching for my rod. Flipped me over and once again massaged a little around my groin then started stroking me again. I sat up and grabbed her arse and she did not budge. So I reached under her dress and she was wearing granny jocks and she said I have my period. So I pulled her top off and sucked her nipples. She was getting quite excited. I had to be somewhere else and I couldn't be late so I thought what the hell and gave in. She cleaned me up and walked out. I thought what the fuck no point in hanging around so I got dressed and left. 

To be honest it worked for me. I was on a tight schedule. Needed to clear the pipes. She went straight into it. Hj was good but no real massage to talk about. It was unreal to be honest. Like an old girlfriend. Go in do your business and see ya later.

I have been here before a couple of times around 12 months ago and massage was okay. I had only started punting but was to scared to ask for extras so didn't get anything.

worth a punt guys. There is extras on offer. They always advertise in the leader.

That's the one. I walked up and they were shut after getting rejected from the Chinese place. That's when i went to Nepean Hwy instead. (getting desperate) She sounded kind of nice on the phone. Will have to try.

There is another Thai place on Poath Rd Hughesdale which i have tried before. Had sucess once before and bombed out twice as i was to embarassed to ask. I am positive they offer as the 3rd time the girl was very good looking and massage was shit. She even hugged me and gave me a kiss on the cheek in the end. I was kicking myself i never asked. Oh well. Next time.

If you get horny enough and your cock is pointing to the ceiling. Sometimes you don't have to ask. If they cover you with a towel, most likely you won't get far. Aka Holiday Calm!

Person's Name :Tracy

Establishment : 1106 Nepean Hwy Highett Full body masage

Date of Visit : 18/03/2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0430686010

Hours of Business : 10am-8pm

Rates : $40 1/2 hour, $70 1 hour, including HJ

Age : mid 30's

Size/shape : size 10-12 

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : RNT

Value for money: Yeah, great soft massage including tug, possibly more on offer

Based on the reviews above thought I would check this place out. 

I ventured in without calling. Knocking on the door I was greeted by a youngish, average looking PRC ( short and rather stocky) and was escorted through to a room at the rear of the house.

After a few minutes Tracy ( a different girl) came into the room. I guess she's mid 30s, had a bubbly, friendly personality. Her English is quite good she asked the normal questions... how long.. soft or hard.. been here before etc.. etc.. etc.

Decided on a soft massage for 1 hour...Tracy took the $70 and left the room while I got changed,she returned about 5mins later.

When she returned I was face down on the table, at that point I thought my nightmares were going to turn to reality.. I felt the dreaded towel being draped over my ass so started to pray that I'd at least get my moneys worth from the the massage.

Tracy moved to the head of the table and began a slow massage  of my shoulders.. neck.. and back...using plenty of oil. I could feel her boobs (Not overly large) rubbing against the back of my head as she reached down my back...

Moving to the side of the table to massage my lower back, with each stroke of her hands the towel felt as though it was getting brushed lower and lower as she started to massage my buttocks... eventually it was whipped off altogether...and she began to work on my legs.

I have to say her hands felt good as she worked away on my lower back...butt cheeks and legs. This girl knew where to use a little more pressure and where it was required. Spending time on both sides, eventually sliding her hands between legs to massage my inner thighs, occassionally reaching under to stroke the "tackle" asking for confirmation that she was doing a good job...and hell yeah she was.

This went for about 45mins but the time passed quickly... after a long day at work.. laying on the table her massage had taken me to that place of semi awareness. She left the room and returned with a warm towel to wipe off the excess oil and it was time for the flip.

On the flip she gave a quick but nice massage of my chest and legs... running her hands up and down my inner thighs... brushing my tackle... caressing my balls until she had me pointing to the ceiling...asking as she stroked with both hands "you want"... hell yeah.. of course I wanted... more oil... she took me with both hands... using a great technique to get me to shoot....then the clean up with a warm towel...

After Tracy had left the room, while I was getting dressed, mamasan came in to ask how the massage was... friendly lady.. telling me Tracy only worked there on Mondays...saying with a smile to come again and next time I would be looked after...I would be taking that to mean that there is more on offer at this place.

Would I go f/s with Tracy... hmmm... probably not... but I'd sure as hell see her again for a massage and tug...she's not unattractive.. but not really my type. 

While I was there I didn't see the other girls.. but there sounded to be a lot of girl chat going on in one of the other rooms...this place is worth checking out! Great 1 hour massage and tug for $70.. nothing else was asked for.

Went last Saturday for a quick release and massage. What a HJ. Grabbed my tackle from behind and then flipped me over and got every last drop out. Didn't ask for a name again nor did i care. This place is real comfortable. She started the massage standing in front of me and reaching over so i went straight for the grab of her arse to let her know not to stuff around. Definately more on offer. Girls were everywhere. Sleeping in the other rooms. Not sure what's the story but who cares.

Sorry buddy. I tried 1/2 an hour at Mali Traditional Thai Massage in Station st and didn't get anything other than a fantastic massage and blue balls, (more to offer i am sure and might try it this week end) so went to Nepean where i was sure something would happen. I was a little toey as you could imagine and did not waste anytime with formalities. Just wanted to get in and out. I will make time and go back for a 1 hour massage and complete a full review soon. Once again my apologies but i do recommend this place.

agree with Malaka. went to Tuck st and got very ordinary massage and that was it. New nepean would be able to help out so dropped in for a quick 30 mins. $50 and thats it - no more questions or haggling. Kelly was her name - mid 30's - nice body and in loose dress - hot arse and silky nickers that she doesn't mind you enjoying. her style is relaxed and experienced. She had me on edge for the last ten mins and knows her stuff. Talked about how she likes massage and well maybe next time - always next time. All in all forget Tuck and go where you know

Have been here a few times. Place is ok (bit tired). At least private rooms with proper doors. prices are as above but if you also hand them the extra 10 they know what your about and you don't have to chat anymore (unless you wish or would like to organise a few more treats). I got Kelly this morning. She is quite good looking with size 10 and sexy body. Nice tits - firm as so good chance not hers). Her massage is very sensual and handles the crack and sack with gifted hands. Flip and she starts the teasing all again. She really is good. Allows touching and I didn't push for anything more as happy with how it was going and couldn't be fucked really. She finishes you off nicely and ends with an enjoyable head massage. All in all a pleasant 45 mins. I recommend it and her. enjoy.

[COLOR=#333333]WIR. Yes I will - cheap quick relief - and nice girls[/COLOR]

I've been to this place twice in the last month, and if your looking for young blood you probably won't find it here. Both times I had visited the ladies where 30's-40's but for an extra $10 you can't beat it for value. 
 I have had Cici before and she was fit as for a older bird. Probably mid 30's but she had a fine ass and decent rack. Looks like kelly is a go-er as well. Would love to know if there are any 20's girls that work here. Help a brother out.

Been off the 'punt' for a little while but couldnt help myself reading the above reviews. was a great teasing and hands everywhere experience. only downer was that apparently the boss was away and there was a new girl who struggled so my bird had to keep answering door and then ended up kicking me out after 30 minutes (booked for an hour) as they were too busy. wasnt that fussed as it was good to have an r&t again after a while, but obviously wasnt ideal either. 
will probably give them another go sooner or later

Thanks fellas.

Info above is correct, is now Ho's Massage, I couldn't stop laughing.
Had a massage with a young girl from HK, 23yo Joy who had just started.

Friendly and lovely girl, but not even a hint of anything, asked to leave undies on prior etc.

Good massage, nice experience, no extras.

Folks, it would be good to have a review of the service at the new address, whether the signage be "Ho's Massage" or otherwise.

A Search for the current thread phone number ("0430 686 010") dredge up classifieds or articles from 2012, so as Wicked suggests, this business and the phone number have parted company.

Do Tracy and Kelly still work there ?

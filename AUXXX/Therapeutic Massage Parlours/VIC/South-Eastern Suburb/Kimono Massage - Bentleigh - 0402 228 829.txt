My experience/comments : 

I was feeling a bit toey in the afternoon so I decided to check this place out.  Just walked in and the lady behind the desk was also the masseuse for the day.  It would appear Japanese class clothing consists of tshirt and jeans if anybody is wondering.  She was ok.  Not to my taste, athletic body and nice rack.  Her Engrish was fine but had an accent which I struggled with.  Massage was good - even nearly go so far to say above average.  Discussion came around to extras and wow....  Started with $30 for a HJ (ok - I can live with that) then $60 for tshirt (but not bra ) off and then $100 for full nude.  ummm yeah - I just went for the HJ and that was that.

My experience/comments : Drove past and saw beauty for body and thought I'd give it a go. Decided to get an hour massage with Danielle who is the owner.

When I arrived she asked me to get ready (no draping) and I thought I might be in for something good. She returns and starts some light chit chat. Her massage was quite good and she was a fan of standing at the head end and letting her hair and breasts press agains the back of my head. On the flip, again with no draping, she continued to stand at the head end and push her breasts into my face. She also enjoyed using her nails in a sensual way. 

Turns out she is an ex model who is now a single mother. Blah blah blah. In any case she also does this whole healing thing where she says what she thinks is wrong or right with you...but of a turn off, it was basically like a form of kinesiology...which I don't believe in.

Anyway, she's quite happily massaging me around my erection and says she has to wash me for "what is coming up next" - I thought this sounds promising but once again I was disappointed. After my wash, which served to make me cold as the heater was broken, she continued to massage for the rest of the hour. And that was it! VERY disappointed in the end and the only up side is she thinks I'm VERY healthy...

WIR - Not unless someone else has a better experience they want to share?!

Has anyone been to this place?

It advertises a "Spanish sensual massage", but that could mean anything.

Thanks for the information.

I don't live in Melbourne, but occasionally visit, and was interested in finding a place where I could get a good massage and HJ from an Australian or European lady.  This forum has been a real eye-opener for me; it seems that all the Caucasian masseuses specialise in getting their customers turned on, and then leaving them hanging.

Is that something to do with the Victorian legal system?

Pity , she was very nice.

Danielle can be seen in action as a personal trainer at Cochranes Gym $35 for 30 minutes. Not sure about massage?  Don't mess with her I was working out there the other day to try the gym (old equipment needs a massive update) and this guy who is 210cm and about 150kg is throwing 160kg bars around like they were matchsticks talking to her about baby sitting girls etc. He is either the baby sitter or her partner!

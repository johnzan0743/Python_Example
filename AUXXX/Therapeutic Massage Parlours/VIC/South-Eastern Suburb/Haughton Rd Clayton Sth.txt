No idea but a search on the internet shows Miracle 19 Thai Massage
Maybe you can make a visit, have a session and make a full Review?

International Sex Guide (the Vic forum has the most posts of all capital cities), Australia

Haughton St/Angela are mentioned here, Melbourne - Page 23

<OT>
Members interested in protecting massage businesses may like to check the level of detail
posters choose to include on ISG.

There seems to be no interest in hiding extra services or using code.
</OT>

Back on topic, I am none the wiser about the contact details for this business.

Anyone that does know, please post a review (ie on the template) and I will fix the title.

This is not a review but I heard that this place got turned inside out by council inspectors during the week looking for any evidence of extra services being offered.Apparently doors of occupied rooms were opened without warning and even the tissue boxes got searched for items other than tissues.
Not sure whether this was as a result of any complaints or whether they just did it because they can.

Pretty strange as councils ( local government) were relieved of this 
duty by parliament and the responsibility handed to Victoria Police late last year.
Where did you get that bit of info from?

It clearly is nonsense as Councils never carried out their inspections in this manner ( knowing the workings of Monash City Council quite well, they do not operate this way) and as mentioned it is not in their charter anymore.
So, sir say you have a clear case of bullshit there.

Gents, my quick reading of the legislation indicates that Councils still have the ability to inspect places from a planning compliance perspective. Part 4 of the Sex Work Act (current as of 01/01/2012) deals with the planning controls on brothels. Section 78 Powers of Entry (page 152) says:





			
				Section 134(1) of the Planning and 
Environment Act 1987 (what must be done 
before entry) does not apply to an entry of land 
that an authorised person believes on reasonable 
grounds is being used for the purposes of the 
operation of a brothel.
			
		

Section 134(1) of the Planning and Environment Act deals with requirements to give notice and obtain a Warrant (page 234)
Section 133 of the Planning and Environment Act defines the "Authorised Persons"





			
				The following persons are authorised to enter any 
land at any reasonable time to carry out and 
enforce this Act, the regulations, a planning 
scheme, a permit condition, an enforcement order 
or an agreement under section 173 or, if the 
person has a reasonable suspicion, to find out 
whether any of them has been or is being 
contravenedâ€” 
 (a) any authorised officer of the Department; 
 (b) any authorised officer of the responsible 
authority; 
 (c) any other person whom the Minister 
authorises to assist an authorised officer of 
the Ministry or authority.
			
		

And the following sections detail what can be done during these searches/inspections.

I imagine the "Responsible Authority" for planning approval is the local council. This would appear to indicate that the local council can turn up and search without notice - whether they do or not probably depends on the individual council.

Thanks for bringing it to our attention toomuchtime. And thanks for the useful info re the law Evil Genius. So in short even though police powers have been increased local council still have the power to investigate as well. Let's hope this is just a one off and everyone remains as inactive as they have in the past.

 Cloverleaf Chadstone Review
				
Post Content: 
The place is still operating. I saw it advertised in the leader. Called up the number to check the prices and was cut off with a thank you before I could ask any questions. The girl seemed nice enough on the phone spoke good English. Decided to give it a try as $80 for a decent one hour massage is good value. I asked for an hour and a girl popped her head around the corner almost immediately and took me through to one of the rooms. 

Very nice set up. The room and table were all clean and fresh. Some music was playing through a speaker in the ceiling. Overall a fairly professional looking set up. Kelly asked me to take everything off before she left the room. While I was waiting for her to return I read the signs. One in particular said Non Sexual Service. On return Kelly started on the massage standing in front of my head. I could feel her legs brushing up against my hands as she started on my upper back. She rubbed her hands all the way down my back and bum and asked if I like it like that, or harder? Nice feeling! I asked for a firm massage and that's what I got for most of the session. 

There wasn't much conversation and I just wanted to relax and get my mind off other things which was fine by me. Her massage technique was actually very good. As the massage continued her hands did get in between my legs, bum, round the sides, under my body and touching my balls quite a few times. That was enough to get me hard and as it progressed towards the end it started to get more sensual with softer touches. I was getting really horny and on roll over I was rock hard and she stood behind me and bent her body down almost putting her breast in my mouth. She continued the massage all around my body until she asked me if I would like some attention down there, as an extra. I said ok to $30 and asked her to take it slow. She allowed me to explore her body (through her clothes) and touch her breasts as she continued concentrating on my sensitive areas. A little blowing from her mouth and it wasn't too long before I had a fairly intense finish. There must have been a fairly decent load as it was dripping down the side of my body as she got the tissues to wipe me down.

She left the room to get some hot towels and gave me a wipe down, then used a clean towel to dry me off with a little bit more massage. I lost track of time but if felt like I got well over an hour and she offered me a bottle of water on exit, which was nice!

Overall a fairly good massage!

Was there a couple of weeks ago. Name: Joy Price: $70 one hr massage +$30 HJ.  Overall, the massage was very good (firm) but the finish was just passable.  No touching at all which was pretty crapt.
Not much ball action & slightly rushed.  Wasn't sure if they offered extras, so i left maybe too late to ask.  No fuss at all with the extras, she said yes before i even
finished asking.  WIR? Not to see her but i give it one more cracj with some1 else.

Sorry I was annoyed at the whole experience last nite. The girl's name was Cristina, or Christian, 25yo, student, nothing special. Arrived without booking and was shown to the room. One hour of below average massage and no interaction. Looked she is not confident with English. No blue balls, absolutely nothing at all, not even a decent massage. There, said it. Yes, I know, a bad punt, Lets move on.

Prices: $70 + 30 (1 hour)

Age: 20s

Size/shape: Slim, attractive

Services: Massage & HJ

Value for money/recommend ? Yes, varying results

My experience: I have been to this place a few times over the past year. The first couple of times there was nothing else on offer other than the massage, which seemed strange as they never cover you up with a towel. But on return visits I was lucky enough to see both Olivia and Kelly who provided good massages that became quite sensual. The place is in a group of shops and is quite nice inside. They always give you a bottle of water when you leave which is a nice touch.

Date of Visit : 27/09/11

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 9807 3999

Hours of Business : 10am until... not sure

Rates : 45mins / $65, HJ $20

Age : No idea - looked young and I didn't ask

Size/shape : Slim PRC type with small cups size - smelled good! looked cute

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : R&T - sometimes..

Value for money/recommend? : No - over this place too hit and miss
My experience/comments:

On this occasion my experience was ok - but See existing thread in the S.E. section Vic.. I find this place more miss, then hit and its getting expensive!! My last visit (not this review) was at 10.45 am and the masseuse hadnt even arrived yet.. opens at 10.. so I moved on.

But anyway - I have been to this place about 4 times now and really dont find it good value for money. On this occasion, Amy was cute (which always sucks me in).. and her massage skills were not too bad - although I have had way better elsewhere. I always prefer a hard massage and this was ok but on the soft side.

Comes time for the flip and I get the golden question - I say yes.. she confirms that I will "tip" her - I say yes sure - $20.
She proceeds to perform a very mechanical HJ - almost amateurish really.. Maybe I am too practiced (LOL) but really how hard can it be? To cut a long story short, I eventually got there but I may as well have been getting the deed done by Robbie the Robot (if you know what I mean).. I tried connecting with this girl, talking, lightening the mood - which usually I have no issue with, but there was nothing there. 

So, that's it for me and this place.. Might give it a miss for a while... there are better establishments for me (but more on this later..)

I have been reading that some punters are getting hit and miss at this place. I have had Toni a few times and she has offered Tug service each time. I think it is a case of being identified as a regular and then it's offered. Anyway I enjoy this girl, she has the right balance of innocent looks without acting like an airhead. She gives a great hard massage too - uses the elbows to really get into the muscles which I like. I even find I leave feeling great from the massage as well as the happy ending.

Hey guys,

I haven't been to this shop in a couple months, probably back in July 2012. Anybody been here recently? Last time I would see Kelly, but there was another girl there I never tried, Tall, skinny, mid to late 20's PRC? 
I never got around to booking her as I was on a good thing with Kelly. Would like to hear* some more recent reports. Looks like most of us just stuck with Toni, and Kelly.

Cheers!

Hey all, this is my first review as i'm new to the punting game. Been reading the forum here for about month trying to get up to speed on punting etiquette & tips.
Had to pick up the old man from epworth hospital friday after work, so whatever punt i was going to take had to be quick and not to far off course to Richmond. Did a quick scan through the usual online classifieds and decided on the Colverleaf mainly due to it's location. I was desperate and it was only hours away from the world ending according to the Mayans.
Parked out front and went inside. Wow, this place is very nice. I'm now thinking legit, but i still wanted to nude up and be rubbed by a young asian and time was running out. Asked about pricing  and availabliity from the cute asian receptionist and told 2 bricks for 30min but no one is available currently. Kelly who was in the hallway next to receptionist had a booking at 5pm so "no can do". Told them I was just after a quick shoulder and calf massage and would return another time. As I was about the walk through the door i hear them talk in their native tongue then call out "Can do 20 min if u like? Tirty dollar?". Sold...to the man with blue balls.
Was quickly ushered into the first room which was small but very clean and nicely decorated. Kelly asked me to remove my shirt and just roll up my pants to the knee to perfrom the calf massage. WTF!!! Suddenly my hamstrings begin to ache, I advised her of this and she said "ok, off with the pants, but leave underwear on". Jumped on the table with my jocks on and the massage began. The shoulder and leg massage was quite soft as i'm used to rigorous physio massage. There was none of the flybys i was hoping to experience. Due to my request of a quick shoulder/calf/hamstring massage the whole thing took place with me lying on my stomach. A very amateurish mistake on my part. As the massage was coming to an end, i thought "what the hell, nothing to lose here". I asked "K" if she did special massage (while giving the univerally recognised tug hand jesture to avoid anything being lost in translation). She quickly replied back with "for him, yes" (while pointing to my groin area). Extra was a brick & bluebird. I said great and asked about nude for an extra brick, but she declined saying she doesn't do it. Finally, asked to flip and off come the jocks. K oils him up and gets to work. Was allowed touching under shorts and shirt, which seemed to be sown together at the waist. From my position on my back i could feel her bare arse through the leg hole of the shorts. She is quite shy and very polite, but had great tehnique and I lasted all of 30sec. Probably the easiest money she's every made. In saying that, after a week of no release she would've made me blow by hand swatting flys off my member. She was genuinely suprised when I popped. I'm not sure if was because of how quick it took or the thick 6 roper I shot onto her arm and my stomach. She then cleaned me up with tissues, warm towles and I exited with a complimentary chilled bottle of water. Overall experience was excellant for a firt time punt. She looked after me very well and I found her very attractive. I was also happy with the 3 brick total damage as I was prepared to park with 2 pineapples to get the first punt out of the way.

Had originally made a booking for Kelly for a Friday lunchtime, but due to a work appointment had to move it forward a day. Spoke to the young mamassan on the phone and tried to reschedule my booking for Kelly but she was fully booked that day. Thought about leaving it till the next week, but my balls had other ideas and requested a booked on my behalf with whoever was available sight unseen. Made the lunch dash from work up the M1 and pulled up 2 minutes before the booking. Raced in and handed the receptionist a pineapple and was shown to a different room to my first 2 massages. Ilena is already in the room and we make our introductions. She is a attractive tiny Taiwanese with a great vibe and I am happy to get her. She leaves the room and I strip off and jump on the table face down. It seems like I waited 5 min or so for her to return. I am anxious as i'm required back at work shortly and haven't allowed for any delays such as waiting around, traffic, etc... Massage begins and it's not bad. Found a few knots around my back/neck region. She was quite chatty and we talked about what she has done in the few years she's been in Oz. Her "engrish" wasn't the best so I had to repeat myself a few times for her to understand. Requested deep tissue treament of my calves and she had no idea what I was talking about.  I instead tried to explain by saying "hard massage here" and pointing to my calves. The calf massage was nothing to write home about so I initiated the flip myself as time was of the essense. She began massaging my chest/stomach/thighs and the old fella rose to the occasion as she teased around him. I let her know that I was really enjoying the massage and she went straight to work on the old boy without negotiation. The tug was very similar to Kelly's and made me wonder if they hold group training nights for the girls at this place to teach them the ancient technique passed down the generations. If so, i'd like to volunteer for them to practice on. Anyway...i'm getting off topic here. I asked Ilena if anything else was on the menu and was told no, but I could touch on top of clothes. She had a tiny firm ass and nice breasts for her size and I let her know that I loved her body. She replied that I also have a nice body and she likes touching it (probably standard response). The climax came and she mentioned there was a lot to clean up. Little did she know that Mrs Palmer had taken care of me about an hour before the massage to extend the duration of the tug. Chatted while she wiped me down with warm towels and mentioned that she only works at this shop 1 or 2 days a week with the other 4 being at another shop. I then tipped her the standard brick & bluebird, chucked on my work clothes and raced back down the M1 and back at my desk with a few minutes to spare. Getting good at this racing around stuff, but looking forward to getting an hour somewhere when I'm not in a hurry and can fully relax. Unfortunately circumstances don't allow that very often.

Value for money/recommend? : Maybe!! 

My experience/comments : 
My second vist to this AMC place (first time was with a hilarious outcome, I'll hold it for another review) which is located on a strip of shops right next to a train station. Place looks very legit and has a "professional" looking website and does gift vouchers etc. 

Walked in without a booking and the place still looks clean and nice inside. Paid $75 to the receptionist and was allocated the first room on the right. Very small room with a massage table and enough room for the massage lady to walk around the table. Small table in the corner with the oil and box of tissues (things looking up).

Stripped down to the birthday suit and lay on table. Was getting impatient as it took Helen almost 10 minutes to come into the room. She comes in, dims the lights and starts sensually running her fingers down my body which gave me goose bumps! This went on for about 5 minutes and then she started a very mediocre oil massage. The next 15 minutes was very quiet and my quest to start a conversation was unsuccessful, I had the distinct impression her english skills was not too great.  

Suggested that I flip and asked for extras, quoted $30 for JH and no other extras was on offer. Accept the offer and Helen started quite a good  HJ using Sorbolene cream rather than oil which was a first for me. HJ was pretty much using both hands in a cork screw fashion. Tried to touch her legs and she kind of moved away and out of respect I did not try any further.  Erupted and was cleaned up with tissues.

Finished the massage with a face massage and a wet towel wipedown and was handed a bottle of water (nice touch) and I was on my way.

Will I return, not for a while.

Overall the massage was good, relieved the tense muscles from long drives. Had bits of chat here & there. Asked what services ppl usually get and said R&T. She asked for $30, so I said "OK". Unusual experience from here as she  makes the R&T feel like she's doing her BF or something. She pushed her boobs on my arm few times, she did let me feel bit, but I didn't try anything deep. Overall it was OK. Something to give a try.

Value for money/recommend? : Possibly, see below

My experience/comments : I went to Viewpoint but since there was a delay of 45 minutes, 
decided to give Cloverleaf a go. Parked in front of Cloverleaf and entered the premise. 
There seemed to be no one there except for Love. She asked what I wanted, since this 
was my first time, I told her I'd like to try 30 mins and see how we go. She ushered 
me to a room heated by a reverse cycle AC which was quite loud however, I undressed 
and go onto the table. Love comes back and we strike up a good conversation on the 
weather and how the AC sounds like a hurricane. She asked what kind of massage and I 
opted for a medium. She gave me a good massage, just on the back for the entire period 
but gave me full indication of what was on offer by teasing little brother and the sac. 
I didn't respond much at this stage. At the end of 30mins, she said she was going to 
get some wet towels to rub down. When she returned, I asked her if HJ was on offer and 
she said, yes, she can do that for $30. I agreed and after the rub down, flipped. 
She oiled him nicely and started slow. She had no problems with me fondling her D cups 
but wouldn't take off her clothes. She seemed to be a bit distracted when I started 
massaging her pussy from underneath and said not today maybe next time but I persisted 
and could see her breathing pattern change (maybe something there) With both my hands 
busy, I didn't realise when I came. She wiped me down taking full care and made me a 
happy man. I changed and she was waiting outside, paid her the $30 and she handed me 
a bottle of water and said she looked forward to seeing me again. All in all, a very 
happy experience.

Will I return? Well, the punter in me says explore but maybe I'll return someday.

Some more experiences to post....

i saw love who i regulary see at korean style in northcote. i saw her here as its close to my residence.  The shop from the outside looks fairly bland,and its a very quiet strip with no cars in the parking areas out the front. inside the shop looks very professional. the receptionist was reading an ipad when i arrived and she put me in a room to wait for love. i booked her the day before. love told me they  record how many men the girls see, then they can see how in demand a girl is. anyways i received a very hard massage from love and i didnt request any extras much to her dissapointment.  love told me she makes 2$ less per job here compared with korean style but she gets more bookings here. When i left love handed me a bottle of water as is there tradition. i then went home and poured the water over my head for my baptism lol.

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Dropped by to see what other massage ladies were like. Got Ellen, an attractive girl wearing dark stocking and 1piece dress. Undress but left jocks on. Started massage with oil and gave a decent massage. I was also getting cold since she forgot to turn heater on. Don't complain much as not the fussy and outspoken type. She's rubbing my ass etc etc.. so i go she might as well rip the jocks off and she ripped them off. after a while i got the flip... shaking from cold and she didn't noticed, so i polite ask for heater and she turns it on... ooh the relief. Anyways she massage away and trying to get me alive. Her tummy was rumbling and she say she's hungry and hasn't eat as they were busy. I was imaging she has lots to eat in room if she looked for it, but that's another story. Anyway I was wide awake now that she's rubbing around the area in front of me and got nothing to cover. I got a bit of roam of her ass and she moves away as you touch her skin. Took a while and she was asking why, I told her I wanted more time to roam as she had a nice butt. She replies, "I know, I look pretty and many guys want me.". Hell no replies from me until all done and she gives me a warm towel rub down. All done and she gives me a bottle of water to go.

275 Huntingdale Rd, Chadstone. Open 7 days to about 8 pm. Advertises on Locanto: Cloverleaf Massage, chadstone - Health Melbourne.

Went to this place three or four times during 2013. 

Commercial premises. Shopfront facing Huntingdale Rd. Fitout is simiar to a place like Kung Fu Massage - legitimate looking but somewhat run down reception area. Handful of small massage rooms.

All Asian therapists.

Each time I went there I recieved a very good and strong Chinese massage. All massuses are young - 20s or 30s. Not particuilar attrative but not unattractive either. Clearly they have been hired for their massage skills rather than looks alone. 

Only once did I receive an extras. It was a bit of suprise as I was not expecting this. I cannot recall the name of the girl. She saw my erect dick and asked me if I needed any help with it. She gave me a good HJ. I was allowed to touch her but only over her clothes. I tipped her $50.

I have been to this place twice now and both times with extras.  30 for a HJ.    Last time was only last week, had a massage from a taiwanese girl called Coco.  i rate it as pretty average compared to other places I have tried.

First time i went the girl asked me, second time i asked while i was still on my front but I am sure on the flip she would have suggested it anyway.  There was far too much sensual touching going on for her not to ask.

I have also been to this place and HJ is on offer from the girls I have had. I have always had to ask. Will have to go back in 2014 to see if things are still the same.

Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm

Age : Late 20s/Early 30s

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Nude HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments :
Apologies to the mods for my inactivity on this forum, hoping my next two reviews will get me back in the good books.

Saw Sugar on a Friday night after calling up and making a booking with Nicole who ended up seeing another gentlemen, although I was not disappointed with seeing Sugar.

It is clear from the start of the massage that she knows what she is doing as she knows how to position herself and where to place etc to get a client's attention.

The massage itself is strong, overall solid back massage, the lower body portion not so much as she spent a good 20 mins on my back before wiping me down with tissues in the room and going into sensual mode on the legs  before asking me to flip.

Question is popped straight away and she quotes me $30 for a standard HJ, $50 for topless and $70 for nude, I went with the nude option and I was not disappointed, she has an excellent body and her overall looks match her name, she is someone that you could definitely call your sugar baby, she starts with nipple sucking before some ball licking and then going in with the HJ which wasn't a great technique but it got the job done and I felt that she went beyond what most girls will do for $70. 

Keen to try the rest of the talent at this establishment but would not be disappointed if I am booked with Sugar again.

Person's Name : Nicole

Establishment : Cloverleaf

Date of Visit : 10/07/17

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As above

Hours of Business : 10am - 8pm

Rates : $55 for 30 mins

Age : Mid 30s

Size/shape : Solid 

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : HJ

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments :

Positive reviews of this place thought I would check it out. Booked over the phone with the guy. Rocked up and he took my money for 30 mins and showed me to the room.  Old school rnt rooms; dirty, dim lit and old.

Nicole enters in soon after I nude up. My run of bad luck continues. Shes a average looking, solid but not fat lady. Massage is ok, flowing strokes but no tease on the flip. 

Flip over and she continues the massage but again no tease. She asks the question and I agree even though I wasn't in the mood anymore since I was there for relief. Tug was shocking, straight into a mega jackhammer. I've never seen hands move that fast. I ask her to slow down which she does for a bit before hammering again. Again it's unenjoyable so I ask her to slow down which she does but says I need to hurry up even though I've got more than 5 minutes left on the clock. She keeps looking the clock and putting no effort in. She says again i need to hurry up and I tell her to stop.

She goes to get a towel to clean me up but I say don't bother. She knows I'm pissed. I put $10 on the table and she doesn't argue.  I walk out and ask the owner for my $5 change since he didn't return it from the $60 I gave him. Usually I wouldn't bother but after a shit experience I wouldn't give this place a cent.

Won't be back. Avoid Nicole.

This shop has had some reviews on a rival site, and the girls are young and hot, even the receptionist are hot, the girls wear skimpy outfits, and ask 100 for nude with bodyslide, but there is a slight problem as i found out today.  They still have a policy off, you cannot meet a girl and decide who u see, they chose a girl for you.  There is a way around this, just wait outside before the open and hope u are attracted to a girl who walks in, and hope they wear a sexy outfit to the front door, and keep it on inside the shop. What a pathetic policy.

Emily the girl i have reviewed at 8 Market st Nunawading and the massage shop next to kfc on North rd in Ormond, works here on Tues.  Financial constraints have dictated a 3rd day for her to work in the massage game.

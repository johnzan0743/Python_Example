My experience/comments :

Had some golf lessons at the 'Heath' and was driving home along Heatherton Road when I remembered that there was an AMP in the block of shops not far away. Drove in that direction and saw a new Thai AMP at the same address. (When doing this review I looked back and found that the old place had closed a while ago)

Entered and was met by an older Thai woman who introduced herself as Pukky. I was given a business card with all the details as above and I also noticed a typed sign stating no sexual services...yeah! Took the 30 min option and was shown to a room, told to undress and she will be back.

She returned and said that as her girls had not arrived, she would give me the massage. A conversation ensued where she told me she was the mamasan, and had 6 girls working there. I was covered by a towel when she commenced a solid massage. She knew her stuff and the massage was what you would like after physical exertion....but no TT or anything resembling sexual.

Told to flip, and again was covered. I looked at her and pointed to l'ill Wol and she shook her head! No! She then positioned herself above my head and concentrated on my chest, neck and head. Then she got a towel, ran it under the hot water tap and cleaned me up, front and back.

Said finished and helped me to sit up, where she added the chop chop to the back of the neck. Got dressed and left as one of her girls arrived. I said hi and she smiled at me. Might return.?

All good, and for once, the sign at reception was honest. Good massage but it was my turn to TOFTT.

Happy Punting ......Wol...as usual ....out

My experience/comments : Hi guys. driving along kingston rd and a flashing sign caught my eye which i decided to call in this massage place  on my way back from Moorabbin. So i call in and was greeted by Annie and we settled for 1/2 hr, $40. Shown to room no 2 and it was ok. reasonably clean and the towels on the table were new as i was the first customer this morning. I decided to remain strong willed and would accept massage without trying to touch her or mention other services and see where that would lead. Annie did ask if it was the first time and i dont know why but i said yes it was.

Annie places a towel over my bum area, and im thinking this is not looking good but im still determined to go with the flow. She commences a strong massage which wasnt bad but for the next 20 mins my back and shoulders got a good going over. The last 10 mins or so she massage my legs. there was no hint of anything and that was ok by me. During the massage we engaged in small talk and she tells me that this place has been open for 9 years. On completion we said our goodbyes and i got dressed and said au revoir.

wir. No. not because i didnt get a hj, but because the ladies i saw in there were to old. If there was a hottie then maybe i would try again. By the way there is not doubt in my mind that extras are available.

cheers

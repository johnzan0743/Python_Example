First post here 

I've been an infrequent punter over many years, from prolific bursts, to several months at a stretch without a punt.  A few years back I started to find it all a bit empty and decided that was a good sign to give it a rest for a while.  During my self imposed lay off I have been going to Koh Feel and usually book in for a two hour Thai massage.  The Asian girls are mostly attractive student types and give great massage.  While there is often some incidental touching and "repositioning" no extras have been offered, nor have I asked.  But, I see one girl semi regularly and last time there was a bit more incidental touching of the old fella than usual because of where he was positioned when she massaged my inner thigh.  Again, nothing extra offered or requested.  But she paused for a moment when she realised the back of her hand was rubbing my erect member and then just continued as normal.  Nothing was said and the curtain dividers preclude any real privacy for such a discussion.

This has kinda spolit a place that has been real good to me.  Now I am in a toey head space when i go there, rather than being able to just relax and enjoy a massage i am wondering about the chance of extras.

Anyone had extras here? Should I push my luck?  

Or, can you recommend a clean, professional Thai place where the rub is as good as the tug?

My experience/comments : Hadnt tried this venue before but went in lookin for a good massage and r&t. 'jane' (very much doubt that was her real name) slightly plump and older but gave a ripping massage. Kept rolling her hands over the nether-regions and then checking my reactions. I encouraged with a smile and other obvious reactions! Nearing the end of the massage she asked me if i liked her service. i moved the towel away and told her she missed a spot. She poked her head out of the room, saw the coast was clear and proceeded to finish me off. Was very surprised she didnt mention price/cash but i gave her a 20 after cleanup and she seemed happy. End result for me was the same but wouldve definitely preferred a younger slimmer hotter girl!

I went here the other day and saw Pam. Lovely Thai girl late 20s early 30s. Ok body about size 8 - 10.
Not sure of boobs cause of outfit.
Had a 1 hour session. Shown the room stripped off and she came back in and started massage. No towel over naked arse and nutsack hanging down. She was very pleasant not much conversation except to ask how hard . I said start hard and finish soft. She proceeded to give a ripping massage. Very careful to miss the tackle . Very thorough and good technique so far as to say it made me very relaxed and far from aroused. Come the flip and carefully arranged towel over tackle and adjusted to get full access to one leg at a time. I didn't ask if any extras and none were offered or even hinted at. She finished me off with a hot towel cleanup etc and waited outside for me to get dressed.
Very professional and when I got down stairs a hot tea and fresh fruit were waiting for me. 
Go here for a great massage and then 325 around the corner to get the tug .

Do you mean Cloverleaf in Huntingdale rd?
Went there when it first opened, paid for an
hour. After the lamest one handed stroke of my
back for ten minutes, I got up, changed and got
my money back. Must have better staff now.

Sounds like Cloverleaf is a waste of time. If you get no joy at 
Koh Feel, why not try KiKi at Forever Young, which actually is around
the corner in Station St ( see the reviews)

I did try that and got a girl with a different description that claimed to be Kiki but no glasses, left me with blue balls and left . Nothing else happening. I think massage etiquette should be if she rubs you up (not down ) should be obliged to finish what they started !!!! Only fair from my point of view .

I don't think the 325 is Cloverleaf.I'm pretty sure it's a private house on Huntingdale Rd in the other direction (Huntingdale?) on the other side of North Rd.I remember seeing a review about it somewhere previously but don't know where they advertise.

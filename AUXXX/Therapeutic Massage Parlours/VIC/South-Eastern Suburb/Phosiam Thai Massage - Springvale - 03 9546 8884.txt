This review is of a legit massage business. I debated whether I should post the review as this forum's focus is on the non-legit venues that we have come to love and admire. But decided to post a brief review so a punter in the area, but looking solely for RnT can save his money.

Since visiting Springvale recently and having a successful punt. I have become a regular visitor to the shopping centre. Best meat and vegies at the best prices. On a recent visit I spotted an absolutely stunning young lady entering this establishment, so I knew I had to check it out asap. Which I have now duly done.

To cut a long story short, things weren't looking good when Mamasan handed me a baggy pair of shorts for me to wear. I was lucky though that the stunner I had spotted earlier was to be my ML.

Her name is Jan, and she is a very skilled practitioner. Far and away the best massage I have had for a long time. 

So for anyone after an excellent, authentic Thai massage (albeit legit.....though YMMV) I thoroughly recommend Jan at Phosiam Thai.

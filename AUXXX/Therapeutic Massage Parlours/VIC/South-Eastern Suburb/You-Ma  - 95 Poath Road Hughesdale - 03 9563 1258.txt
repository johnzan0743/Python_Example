Having seen this lady reviewed elsewhere, I felt it might be too good to be true, but this lady's a gem. She has a friendly personality and surprisingly good English given her recent arrival. The legit massage is a pretty good remedial standard. Prior to the flip she gave a bit of a tickle, but on the flip it really warms up. She started with a slow oily tug and then nonchalantly leant over and gave a first rate BBJ. All no questions asked! Extras were "what you want to pay?" I offered plus $40 for $100 all up and she was happy (though I fear others will offer much more and upset the market).  




My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

I visited this lady again yesterday. A few observations:

- When I saw at reception, I realised that she is really tiny - under 150 cm (somehow you don't notice that when you are horizontal on the massage table) and not really that good looking (mamasan June is better looking in a MILFy way). 
- Despite that she provides a very good service and, when she is in the mood, something approaching a GFE.
- Unfortunately, yesterday, she wasn't in the mood, so it was a little more mechanical
- Nevertheless she is a virtuoso at the HJ / BBJ and leaves you with a smile on the face even if, yesterday, she struggled to crack one herself.

Thanks Bill, I've tried her a few times and she said her name was "You". I agree with your review details. She told me she works seven days 10am till 9:00pm,  so that might explain why she's not always a barrel of laughs. Sweet person though.

If you have seen her a few times a review might be in order? With her prices and reported good service she's probably of interest to quite a few members.

Yes, she said she was You, but she wrote down "You Ma" on the card she handled me and the mamasan calls her "Ma You". Better than ringing up and asking "Is You there" to get the reply "Sure, I is here honey, where you think I is?"

Yer probably, but these days I feel uncomfortable being the first to review a R&T as a few people I really liked had some very hard times with Mr Plod. So I'm generally much more cautious in what I say about erotic massage now. 

If it helps, I'm fairly explicit and detailed when I write reviews about the licensed workers or the various Private Escorts that are flooding the Internet with their advertising â€“ as I judge that they have already decided to publicly identify as a sex worker.

Checked today with Mamasan June and Ma You is gone home for good. I enquired whether June (who I found quite attractive in a MILFy way) might turn her hand to my needs, but it seems, like many tradies who have moved into management, she has "got off the tools". 

"Two new girls, they very good, same as Ma You, they work in Korea" she says, but I passed up the offer and will continue my search for a quality replacement elsewhere.

Person's Name : Mayoo

Rates : $60/hr, $100/90

Age : 49

Size/shape : Short, size 6, a cup boobs

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Fantastic massage, HJ / $30, BBBJ / $40, Nude BBBJ/face fucking / $70

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

I kept an eye out for Mayoo after seeing Billabong Bill's review.  Thanks mate.   She was working in September, then had a few weeks off, and has now returned to work.   She gives a great massage and is very strong for such a tiny person.   I have seen her three times.  The first time after the massage was over she oiled me up and executed a passable HJ but had a tendency to jackhammer and return to jackhammering after being told to slow down.  She very professsionaly resisted my attempts to sit up and change things around.   Knowing there was more on offer, I returned a second time and got the BBBJ without asking, but still found her very controlling and wanting me lying on my back, which I despise.   Third time was a charm, she was in a playful mood, and consented to nuding up, kneeling BBBJ (yeah baby!) and finshing up with an epic facefucking with her lying on the table and me standing over her and going hard while also fingering her.   A much better experience when she isn't being so single minded on how she wants to finish up.   A lovely lady with a gentle personality.  Very much YMMV I think.

Popped in there a couple of days ago......Ma-You/You-Ma is no longer working there, apparently left a week or so ago. Asked where she went, was told a place in Mentone, but didn't know which place it was. Can't say I know the Mentone area well so can't give any recommendations!

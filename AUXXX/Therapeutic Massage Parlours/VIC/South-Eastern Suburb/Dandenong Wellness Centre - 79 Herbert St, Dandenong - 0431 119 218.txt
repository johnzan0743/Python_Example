Comments: New place in Dandenong. Operating from premises which look like they were previously a medical centre. Place is clean and tidy but not particularly modern.

Called and booked with the person who answered the phone. Did not catch her name but thought it was Jade or Jane. She is young and average looking. Body is ok. 

She greated me at the door and showed me to the room and told me to change. I laid on table fully naked. When she came back she did not cover me and started the massage. The massage was reasonably good. It was quite firm. She seemed to know what she was doing but was definitely not an expert.

Turn over with about 10 mins to go. I asked about extras. She initially said that they don't do it hear but after I asked a couple more times she said ok. Also did topless but that took some convicing. All up $70 for extras.

Her breasts are nothing special - largish but not in particularly great shape.

Tug was poor. Very harsh. She didn't really seem to know what she was doing.

I might return but would try and see someone else.

 No Address Provided - Malvern - No Contact Number Provided
				
Post Content: 
Person's Name: Not sure

Establishment: No name on front of shop

Contact Details/Address: 434 (I think) Corner of Malvern & Wattletree Road, Malvern

Hours of Business: Not sure

Prices: $50 for 20 mins

Age: 30's

Size/shape: 12

Nationality or Ethnicity: Chinese

Services: RnT

Value for money/recommend?: OK for the price

My experience/comments: Well, after getting nothing from holiday calm, I drove to this establishment knowing what they do. I did not call as I don't have the number. If I pass through there, I grab the phone number and the actual shop number. Coming back to my experience here, well she told me what service I want. I think they even do FS. I opt for the short session of $50 for 20 mins as that was what I wanted. I was then led to a room with everything in sight and a poster saying "NO Sexual Services". Stripped down and face down and waited. Few minutes, the same girl, around in her 30's quite nice looking and proceeded doing the normal strokes and after about 5 minutes, was told to flip over. Touching is OK and the hands got wondering about to all places but she said "no there, please". The oil was spread and as usual in these places, they try to quickly finish you off as quickly as possible. But as I choose the 20 min session, I cannot really complain. Deed done and dressed up and left. Place was quite clean.here might be another girl working as I heard things moving from another room. 
Will get back to this with actual address and phone numbers soon.

Anybody been there might have the numbers.

This is quite possibly the most dodgy 'review' ive ever seen. No phone number, no shop name, no girls/masseuse name, even changed the address... $50 for 20 minutes for a supposed shop/legit place?!?! Pretty sketchy story pal.

kim, I drove past the cnr of Waverley rd and Malvern rd today and I didn't see anything that might have been an RnT.

Could you provide more details please, i.e. exact address and/or phone number?

If you look at the website for 432 it isn't Chinese! There is one advertised here. 4/150 Wattletree Rd, Malvern 9500 9870 MAA Not sure if it's the same place, as it's not near the corner of Malvern Rd. There was a place at Suite 6, 436 Malvern Rd. Not sure if it's still open.

Is this where Annu used to work out of? Hairdresser downstairs and massage rooms upstairs?
Went there some time ago when it was a Thai massage business (no tug, no go back)

Jogged past the cnr of Waverley & Malvern today, it's close to home. No sign of any place resembling the review. There is one legit place further up the road but that has signage all over. There are businesses at 432 and 434.

Conclusion: The above is either a "fantasy" review or kim has the location all screwed up. I hope to be proved wrong!

Yes there is but that's a long way from the cnr of waverley and malvern to which the review refers to.

Strange that our reviewer hasn't responded to clarify the location or provide a number ...

Only one of his reviews has a phone number apart from, Holiday Calm which has no names, just African/Australian. The majority of girls there are Asian. To score an African//Aussie would be an achievement in any shop.

Visited 109 Waverley Rd last night. First time so didn't expect much. In fact was looking for a good massage primarily. Arrived at entered from the rear which looked dodgy, went upstairs and was greeted by 4 girls. Paid by C/c and was shown to a room. Large room, candlelit with a bed and a massage table. Polly entered as I was getting undressed. Young, small, pretty. I asked if I should leave undies on and she said yes. Massage was fantastic. Best I've had. She really knew what she was doing. Towel was on me even though I had undies on. She just removed part of it to massage that area. She didn't talk, didn't go too close to the boys. Basically a good legit Thai deep tissue massage. But the place definitely looks and feels like there could be more. I'll be going back, that's for sure. AB

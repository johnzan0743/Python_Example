There are four places on or close to Poath.

Chaba Thai Massage  good quality massage but you will need to leave your undies on always!
A beauty Salon - very near the train station that does Lomi Lomi and regular rubs. I think the staff are Korean
Belter Oriental Therapy  used to be a Chinese Acupuncture practice
Baan Thai Massage - near the service station

Had rub and tugs here before but a little hit and miss. Great massage though. Baan Thai Massage - near the service station gives R N T. Been once and received on first visit.

It's in the Shopping Centre, 27 Enterprise Way, Mitcham - went few years ago and got a hj from the older lady
she wore a latex glove while she did it - I didn't go back as it was fairly average for massage and the hj
was called 'Octopus Massage' 

All old intel unfortunately

Person's Name : Alice

Establishment : Bright Crystal Thai massage

Date of Visit : 18/09/2014

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 160 Poath Rd, Hughsdale

Hours of Business : 

Rates : $50/30mins 

Age :20s

Size/shape : Slim, great breasts

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : massage

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, for massage only

My experience/comments : Had seen reviews for this address before, seems there has been a name change. Thought i would give it a try, rather local. Place is nice, big rooms. Booked 30 mins and Alice took me to the room, very cute, great body but poor english. Having not been there before decided to keep the jocks on. Alice returned and i asked if i should take them on or off......keep on please was the answer, not looking good. Massage was great, jocks remained on the whole time and she put a towel over me as well. Oh well, just enjoy the massage. On the flip managed to get a hard on, her elbow brushed past it a couple of times but no reaction at all. Seems this is a legit place. All in all a great massage but no extras to be had. Probably will not return.

Person's Name : Dara

    Establishment : Bright Crystal Thai massage

    Date of Visit : 09/2014

    Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 160 Poath Rd, Hughsdale

    Hours of Business :

    Rates : $65/45mins

    Age :20s

    Size/shape : Slimish, great breasts

    Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

    Services Provided : massage plus Handy

    Value for money/recommend? : Yes, for this visit

    My experience/comments :

Heads up for this place. If you not a REG or know the girls I think getting extras is off the table. 1. they boss has now taken all the doors down and put curtains up. The girls all have to wear shop t-shirts. I had a chat to my ML she told me the place has gone legit. She told me the boss made these changes 2 weeks ago. 

I know Dara quite well so i still got the special service but she was very quiet and wouldn't go past just a tug incase someone put their hear through the curtain which i think could happen. also the boss wasn't there while i was in. think if she was it wouldn't have happened. imo the girls  there atm don't give a massage that competes with many of the legit thai places that are around. if i wanted a real thai massage place in oakleigh is the go. will be interesting to see how they go now. 

Dara, cute size 8 i think... nice rack nice ass beautiful eyes, really seductive. very nice motion. but unlike other times. was very straight, no inside clothes no top off just a HJ. lots of teasing during the massge... and the whole time i had a towel on my. but her hands went nice and deep.

They don't do the $50 promotion any more. I have been there for a couple of times. First time I was charged for $65 and 2nd time I was charged for $50. And the I paid $60 for the rest of visits. I have never asked for anything more than massage. Most of Masseuses in this place are  40years+. I don't bother to ask extra. Massage is really good. I heard a rumor about the Korean run A beauty Salon is on the market. She is selling the business.

It would help when you make such statements that you provide a proper Review with the name of the provider even if it was bad experience. Just making a statement like that is not sufficient and members may take your comments more seriously.

My apologies. I can not remember her name. (some made up name of course) She was just so painful that I have tried to erase it as a bad experience. She kept talking about a sister shop in Carnegie and what I had been offered there

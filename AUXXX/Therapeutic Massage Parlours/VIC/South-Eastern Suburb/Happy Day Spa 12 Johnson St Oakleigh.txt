Sorry. I still go for r&t but not with the same obsession I had a few years ago. I rarely review r&t lately - with the police raids going on etc...

The good moderator pointed this out to me in a PM yesterday. I had no idea it had been around that long. I must have been living in a cave! It doesn't sound like a place worth visiting anyway.

as pointed out by Munch this place been around for a while now.

Had a few sessions there. 

Owner has three shops i was told. 

Hit and miss depends on the girl. all the girls are youngish 20s students from what i could see and 30 for RNT 50 for RNT with touching. 

Chick called Cara was fantastic but i have never seen her there again. others imo just ok but i have not been back for three months.

I called in here last week. Was met by an early 20's Chinese girl in jeans with a surly attitude. She was slim, but not particularly attractive. Nevertheless, I was still curious to see what she looked like nude. Unfortunately, she refused to remove her gear, so I had to settle for a fully clothed Linford Christie.

If you want bj or fs why dont you go to a brothel? Thats what they're for......and you can get an intro with the girls too, and they probably wont be wearing jeans.

Person's Name : Tiffany 

Establishment : Massage Parlor

Date of Visit : 8/9/14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Happy Day Spa 12 Johnson St Oakleigh

Hours of Business : Open 7 days from 10.00am to 8.00pm

Rates : $65 60min +$50 HJ

Age : early 30's

Size/shape : 8 Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Chinese

Services Provided : Massage Only 

Value for money/recommend? : good massage

My experience/comments : 

Dropped in to the Happy Day Spa today in Oakleigh, there are quite a few massage shops in the area but I thought I would try this one out for a change
The shop is jointly owned with the shop in Station st Oakleigh – Forever Young Massage
On walking inside there is a large waiting room in the front with a reception desk
Handed over $65 for 1 hour and was shown the room by Tiffany. The room was nice enough with clean towels and the heater going.
Tiffany left the room to let me undress, and I laid out naked on the table.
Tiffany returns and asks what type of massage I would like, so I asked for deep tissue.
All in all she gave a very good massage, no ball scrapes or anything but did get close….
On the flip, she massaged my upper legs when I asked for a HJ. This would be extra she says, I said no problem pointing to the $35 change on the chair with my clothes. 
Tiffany wants $50 and wasn’t going to budge. I was in a relaxed mood and didn’t worry me either way. But I thought $50 for a fully clothed HJ was too much. After a few mins thinking about her $50 proposition, I offered her $50 for a fully naked massage, to which she declined.
I went on to mention to her that $100 an hr was my limit for a massage with a HJ
She went on telling me that she thought she was better than the other girls on offer. 
At the end of the day, if I was really into her I would have handed over the extra $15. It was more the principal of it. I did feel like I was being shaken down a little….
One thing I didn’t like too much about this shop is that it is in a very quiet row of shops with a bus terminal across the road. So if you were to go during peak hour, you may have up to 4 bus loads of passengers watching you walk in. During the day tho the traffic is much lighter of course…

Anthony great disciplined showing, and members will be pleased you didn't hand over 50$ for a clothed hj.  30$ seems to be the going rate for this service, well done.

I agree braininc but even $30 is a bit more than what it should be for a lot of places still do it for $20 or are even included in the massage as I have posted in my reviews

Person's name: Cici
Establishment: Happy Day Spa
Date of visit: 12/7/2016
Address: 12 Johnson st Oakleigh 
Hours of business: 10am to 8pm, 7 days
Age: Mid 30's
Size: 10
Rates: $70 p/h + $70 (semi) nude hj & exchange massage
Nationality: Chinese
My experience: Great service

Although I knew this lady is expensive for what she offers, she's good at what she does & I felt like a treat. 

After fricken Google maps sending me on a wild goose chase, I was greeted by Cici, wearing a sexy grey dress & a stylish white top. Paid $70 for the hour & plonkes $70 next to the oil as I undressed.

Cici begins the light teasing massage at the head of the table, my hands cupping her shapely butt & her bobs rubbing against my head as she reaches towards my tackle. After 15 minutes of this I was on fire,asking to swap places so I could massage her. She declined at first, not wanting to get oiled but accepted on dry. Turns out my $70 extra wasn't enough to get full nude but took all off except panties & kept her boots on per my request.

I did a bit of medium strength massage on her back & legs yet focused on her butt & cat over her expensive & sexy panties. Turned her over, hopped on the table to dine on her fine perfectly perky b cups abd nuzzle on her neck. Dfk not available, though a previous experience both Dfk & Bbbj were available for more cash while FS was not. 

Finally I say my turn, and after a bit of Spanish commences the tug in 69 position while I grope her butt and cat over her panties. A thorough wipe up after the enjoyable inevitable & I was on me way. 

Too expensive (& far out) to be a weekly visit but I certainly did enjoy myself

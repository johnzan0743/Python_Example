Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

I had walked past this place a few times without going in, but saw some intel which indicated (limited) fun was to be had here. So, with my back playing up and needing some work, I headed down the highway to this establishment, near the South Rd junction. They charge a very reasonable $60 an hour for what turned out to be a pretty good quality deep tissue massage, with a quite competent handy also on the menu. No price was discussed for the extras, but I followed the precedent from my informants and offered a $20 tip which seemed to be right on the mark. 

Natalie is a very pleasant young lady. Not gorgeous and with a bit of a belly, but quite good company. I tried for nude but was told "we don't do that here". I wouldn't mind throwing another $20 on the table to have her curves displayed. Maybe next time. Anyway, at $80 for the hour, this is a very good service, particularly when compared with some of the rip-off shops around in this part of town.

Fair comment Chalkie. Prices in Melbourne's north and west are pretty competitive but we in the the leafy suburbs of the east and southeast seem to pay a premium unless we shop around and put in the required legwork (all three). Or else pack a cut lucnh and journey to the other side of town.

Date of Visit : 13th April 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 892 Nepean Hwy VIC, 0402 638 639

Hours of Business : 10AM - 9PM

Rates : $60 per hr plus $20 for HJ

The front half of the shop has cubicles with Â¾ height walls, while at the back of the shop they have fully enclosed rooms -nicely furnished and with shower! I'm not sure if this is the way they do it, but they could run 2 businesses, with legit remedial massage at the front and the dodgy stuff at the back.

I was met by the young papasan and announced that I had booked with Emily (based on a good referral). He directed to the "waiting room" tucked away behind a screen. After a few minutes, Emily appeared, took my hand, and led me to one of the private rooms. She is a nice looking young lady who looked just lovely in her tight black skirt and T-shirt. She proceeded to give me a very good quality massage (especially at the $59.99/h price). On the flip, she proceeded up the legs to meet young Bill, who was by then staring her straight in the eye, and gave him a very nicely paced tug. Contact with Emily was limited, although I was able to get a sneaky hand inside her skirt before getting over the line.

Based on my previous advice, I proffered the standard extra for the shop of a mere $230 and was happily on my way. All told, excellent VFM.

Yes thanks Panch. It was only $20 (twenty dollars) but that amount is so conspicuously below the standard low price of a tug of $30 (thirty dollars) that I still couldn't quite compute the ide as I typed the amount. That and a deliberate typo to ensure the loyallty and attention of my readers. Well done!

Right, seems a new place has popped up. Across from the new Woolworths/Appartments on Highett Rd, next to the station. Was still open at like 6.30 last night (Sunday) which struck me as odd/encouraging. Can't find anything on the net about it. I'll suss out the name and exact addy, but not sure when I can get in there. 

Just thought Id give peeps a heads up.

Been once - same old ladies as the sandy massage - same owner. can get your RnT $70 for hour and at least $30 for ending - didnt enjoy as these older girls like to haggle and dont like to give up the change. Also very average inside and tiny rooms - stick to the highway

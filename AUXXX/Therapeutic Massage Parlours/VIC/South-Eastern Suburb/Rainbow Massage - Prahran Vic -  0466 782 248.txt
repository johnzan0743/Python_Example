My experience/comments : 

It was about 7pm and I had sometime to kill. I actually wanted a decent massage but True Thai on chapel couldn't fit me in. Given that this place was the only one open I thought why not.

Was shown the first room up the stairs on the right. To be honest the room wasn't very clean which was off putting. Kim came in and started the massage. It wasn't of a good standard. We had some small talk. She seemed nice enough but she didn't like what she was doing. She said that and it came through in the massage. Before the flip some light fingers up and down my legs and bum. No sack action. On the flip she asked $50 for HJ. I thought Massage was so shit I'm not even going to counter. Save my cash. In summary, avoid. Crap rooms / massage. I'm sure something better would be on offer nearby.

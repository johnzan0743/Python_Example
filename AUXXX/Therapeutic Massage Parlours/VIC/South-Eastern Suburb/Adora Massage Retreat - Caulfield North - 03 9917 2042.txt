Adora Massage retreat has moved in to the building previously occupied by Heavenly Healing.

Heavenly Healing was a lomi massage site which offered two styles - standard lomi and "Hawaiian" lomi. The latter was the same as first by the massuse was topless. Often the ladies working there were stunning but, in spite of the topless offering, they were very strict about extras and these were never provided.

I thought I would give it a go when the place changed to Adora. However, the place has now become even more legit. It is now a day spa targeting women. Fitout is very modern - the type you would find in a proper beauty salon.

I tried a lomi and it was completely professional - all my parts were covered at all times and the massuse went know where near my genital area.

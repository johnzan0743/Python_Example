Value for money/recommend?: Nice massage, pretty okay rub.

My experience/comments: 
This is the second time I've been here. First time nothing happened, but there were indications.

I always go full commando in massages, and the first time around she put a towel loosely around me. It was a great massage - not as good as some that you get in say Holiday Calm, but it was awesome. They heat up the oil - which is awesome!

This chick had a massive rack - I'd say 36-38 F/G? 

One of the best feelings ever is when boobs hang over your head, and slowly caress over them as the masseuse's hands go down your back... 

Anyway - fast track, the last fifteen minutes of the massage, she asked me to turn over - with the towel hanging very loosely over my waist. Let's just say that I felt the breeze over my balls 

I was obviously hard as a rock - and her fingers was tingling all over.

I asked her if anything was up on offer - she said maybe next time, and walked off to get a hot towel.



Anyway, second time coming - I asked for her, and lo and behold - there she was.

She remembered me, and asked me to lie face down (well and truly knowing what will happen).

Awesome massage again - and got a few accidental brushes on my little brother. 

By the way - I had no towel on this time around.

She motioned for me to keep quiet, and boy - the warm oil was awesome.

$30 in tips.

**I am Asian, by the way - and I speak mandarin. All of the conversations transpired in mandarin - but her english is halfway decent.

There's an unattractive larger PRC gal in there called Maytay? I thought I'd lucked out getting her and this was confirmed when she advised she didn't provide extras. Massage was pretty good and for $60 bucks I couldn't complain too much. My blue balls will have to wait for another day.

Person's Name: Cindy

Establishment: Red Lotus

Date of Visit: June 2013
Contact Details/Address/Weblink: Red Lotus Cheltenham 

Hours of Business: 10-8pm daily

Rates: $60/60 minutes opening special

Age: 29

Size/shape: slim

Nationality or Ethnicity: Taiwanese

Services Provided: Tug

Value for money/recommend?: Very good

My experience/comments: 

Thought I'd check out this new place as I had a few hours to kill before catching up with some mates for pizza and footy on a Friday night. Had spotted a fairly suggestive advert online, and had also checked out their website which looked very professional. Maybe they are catering to both the legit and r'n't market?? Their online ad sounded like it was written by a punter and mentioned that this place does not time cheat, clock watch, answer phones during massage, re-use towels from the previous punter and they use odourless massage oils no one will ever know you had a massage.

Rolled up around 5pm , did an initial drive by and parked round the corner in the side street, then waited for the foot traffic from the arriving train to clear. Walked in and the place looks immaculate. The multi story building is maybe a year old with floor to ceiling frosted store front with professional decals which actually looks very legit. All staff are wearing a uniform of black shirts with the business logo on them. Greeted by cute young asian receptionist who is chatting to a female customer enquiring about a massage. At this point I think maybe all I'll get here is a legit massage as there are no signs anything else going on.other than the clues in their online ad. Anyway, they have an opening special at the moment, so I was happy to go through with it to satisfy my curiosity. I suddenly spot the familiar face of Momo at the reception desk, and she says hi and says business is going well so far. I let the receptionist know that I'd made a booking for 5pm and she tells me Cindy will be looking after me. Momo takes me to the first room. It's quite spacious, extremely well lit (maybe not a good sign) with the biggest and sturdiest massage table I've come across in my travels so far. She leaves me to strip off and tells me Cindy will be in shortly. Cindy enters and I'm impressed. She's wearing the standard issue uniform shirt but with cut off denim shorts and thongs on this very cold Melbourne day. She's quite cute with a fit slim body and pleasant looking face with black rimmed glasses. Her English is great but she has a bit of trouble understanding mine. She mentioned that she used to work at the "eternally juvenile" massage chain for a while before coming to this new shop where Momo has trained all the girls. The massage was quite good and she was very thorough in making sure nothing was missed. On the flip, she turned out the bright lights and put on a mood light in the corner of the room. She then proceeded to massage my chest, legs and feet. I guess Cindy had been worded up on what kind of massage I usually get from Momoas she concluded the massage by going straight into the tug without discussion. I ask if anything else was on offer but not on this occasion. Her technique was experienced as she used one hand on my shaft and the other probing under my sack. She then spent a good 10 minutes cleaning the oil off my body, then provided a complimentary bottle of water on exit. I tipped her a brick+bluebird and she told me I was generous. Overall, the experience with Cindy was quite good. She's a happy, cheeky girl and the place is very nice and clean. The receptionist asked how I enjoyed myself as I left and asked if I'll be coming back, to which I replied "yes".

My experience/comments : 

This place is local for me have been past plenty of times and have seen the adds on Locanto too so popped in to seee what was on offer

Place is ultra clean the girls are all pretty even the nerdy girl on reception. Took the half hour option $50 and was shown to the room which has all the essentials clean towels, music going etc....only problem you can hear the punter next door to but this place caters for female and male massage with female punters there too

Lydia provided an excellent massage with some slight touching before the flip to let me know what was on offer - before the flip sheperformed that nice light touching were you just have to lift that little bit more so she can grap a little bit more 

Straight asked $30 for HJ and accepted $20 - here skills were excellent allowed touching under clothes (C Cups) and that was all that was on offer.

In summary excellent massage nice rooms clean place and $70 seems to be the going rate all around Melbourne

My experience/comments : 

Rolled up to Red Lotus as i was in the area... thought would give this place a try. Shop is very clean and well fitted out. with a what seems a dedicated reception girl. 

I had to wait 15 min for a ML so parked on a chair and starred at a wall till i was called into a room. room's are nice clean and warm. My ML was Taiwanese slim easy to talk with despite her average English skills. she gave a good massage with lots a pressure. but did not give any hints. on the flip after a little while i popped the Q and was told she didn't do that. Trouble i thought.... then she told me she could get another girl to do that.. Sweet but the worry set in to the appearance of the finisher. 

Missed her name and nationality as well. Asain looked Chinese 23-25YO. she was very cute a little chubby but very nice... she asked for 30 and i said i would tip 40, great technique single to double and didn't mind my hands touching and rubbing all her assets. first time so didn't try to go inside her pants but got them inside her top nice firm perky tities. she got me over the line and used warm towel to clean up the oil.

I would return for her but i can't bloody remember her name...

My experience/comments : 

Found ad on Locanto, had a look on here to see if there were any reviews but couldn't find anything.
Rolled the dice and TOFTT, if anything I was going to get a much needed massage.
Made a booking, got there and it was all quiet professionally set up... started to think this is all legit.
Got introduced to my ML and she wasn't to bad to look at, dressed in those legging that look like jeans and a black singlet top.
Shown to the room (right next to recption) she dimmed the lights and then left the room.
I stripped off, and got comfy......Keely returns with her oil bottle floating in a jug of hot water (i love warm oils) She runs a hand from my calf to my shoulder, I think to test the water as her fingers went real close to the crack.
Massage begings, and it's pretty decent good pressure and does work at some of the tight spots. She altinates between propper massage and teasing with a bit of attention of the bum cheeks and crack.... this feels great. Next she makes her way down to the legs, and she really gets in to all areas (great bum massage and even gives decent attention to the perineum) Now by this time she has really got me going.
The flip comes and she starts on the legs with plenty of groin action and a few acidental brushes of the old fella, then the question comes. I play dumb and say I've never had one before, do you do that kind of thing here  she was like "sure"! I go okay then, that'll be nice and she holds up 3 fingers, I respond with 2 and she looks a little deflated but doesn't challenge it and gets to work. I grab her on her squishy ass and then go for some boob action, but get blocked in the process. I think if I had more cash I could have got more.
She gets me over the line, followed by a quick clean up with tissues.... still 15mins of massage left so she goes back to massaging my legs and keeps grabbing my cock and balls and giving them more massage, never really had a ML do that before. Usually once I'm done and they have cleand me up they wont touch again, was a nice change.
Less than 10 minutes to go and she trots off to get the hot towles for a pretty decent clean up.
All in all a pretty good hour, be good to see what the other girls here are like, only got to see reciptionist and Keely. (reciptionist was a little on the chubby side) 
Happy punting guys.

Hours of Business: 10-8pm daily

Rates: $55/60 minutes

Age: early 20s

Size/shape: petite and slim

Nationality or Ethnicity: Asian. 

Services Provided: Anna - massage, Angela - tug

Value for money/recommend?: Nice massage, nice tug.

My experience/comments: 

Came here to take advantage of the boxing day special. was escorted into a room by a cute young lady. Her name was Anna, and she is new. only been in the country and at the place for 1 month. Her massage skills reflected it, wasn't the best massage, but for someone only 1 month in, she's a fast learner. She has a nice personality and a good level of social chit chat, but started to annoy me when she kept asking me if the massage was ok every 5 minutes. I tried to be polite and complimented her each time, occasionally asking for a bit more pressure.

Came the flip, mast was well down, and throughout she stayed well clear from junior. Time was running out and so I popped the question. She giggled all shy and stuff and said that she isn't ready for it, I joked around how she could practice on me and I could teach her, but she giggled more and said maybe next time she will be ready. She did offer to bring someone else in to do it, to which I accepted. Angela came in, and she was a real cutie! She knew what she came in for and she had that cheeky smile on her face that was turning me on. She had freezing hands, and we joked about it for a bit, took a few minutes for her hands to warm up and for junior to feel like he can gear up. All this time, Anna decided to massage my head and shoulders whilst watching, and this was a big turn on. Never had two people in the same room. I asked Anna if she wanted to join in the tug, Angela was also trying encourage Anna to come join in the fun. Anna still giggled very shy and declined. 

Soon after, Angela brought me over the line, left and told me to pay the tip to Anna. Anna then wiped me down with hot towels and session was over. I'm keen to come back for Angela, as she seemed very playful and wouldn't mind finding out how far she would go!

Value for money/recommend?: Good massage, nice tug

My experience: 
Took advantage of the winter special calling up to book. Haven't been here for a while and didn't ask for anyone in particular.

The receptionist has a sweet voice on the phone, but not one I would want to see in the room. I was escorted in by a cute petite Vietnamese girl.

She was chatting a lot at the start, getting to know me. I usually don't like to talk during a massage because they get distracted. But she continued a fairly decent massage. The only annoying part was she kept asking if it was ok.

The massage started off hard and then turned to sensual. Rubbing the insides of my legs, then very close to my sensitive zones on the flip side. She asked if I wanted any extras and held up 3 fingers. 

Her technique was excellent and she had me flowing in her fingers in no time at all. She blocked any touching above her waist, but happy for me to have a feel of her bum cheeks however.

All up value for $

Will return 7/10

Value for money/recommend?: Relaxing massage, great tug

My experience: 
Took advantage of the latest offer calling up to book. Didn't ask for anyone in particular and went in blind.

Paid up at the desk. Same receptionist as the last couple of times. I was lead in by a young tall Chinese girl who called herself Ivy. 

She didn't say much and seemed to have a bit of an attitude. I got the impression she didn't like me. I didn't bother to try to warm her cold attitude and almost fell asleep during the massage. 

The massage started off soft without asking at all what I like. Then on rollover there was no towel and straight away she asked if I wanted extra for $30. I asked if touching was included. She said yes. 

Her technique was awesome and she let me touch her all over. I felt her breasts lifting her bra. Then asked her to undo it for me. She put her nipples in my mouth and the excitement was too much as she jerked me off to victory. I think more maybe on offer for the right $. 

All up value for money. Although time seemed to be cut short. Offered me a water and left her a tip. 

Will return...

Value for money/recommend?: Excellent massage, nice tug, not so friendly 

My experience: 

Been to this shop a few times now. Good prices when they have a discount. Booked ahead not asking for anyone in particular. They have a new door bitch. I'm 100% sure I have had her at Holiday Blue Calm several times. She looks really cute, but a smile would help.

In the room usual routine. Strip off wait for a few minutes. Olivia walks in soon enough. She looks barely legal. Very tiny and skinny. If she went to a night club would definitely be asked for ID. 

He massage was fairly decent considering her small size. On the roll over she started rubbing me in all the right spots, but avoiding the obvious then ask If I wanted any thing extra. =

She asked for $30 which is standard deal here! Her HJ technique was actually pretty good like her massage. The only down side was she moved away from hands reach and I was barely able to touch her arm.

She cleaned me up and finished me off with a head massage. Bit of a chat. She works there a couple of day per week.
All up not bad value for money.She offered me the usual water to go.

WIR? Wouldn't mind trying the door bitch

Value for money/recommend?: Very poor massage, nice tug, friendly 

My experience: 

Ok I got sucked in by the Winter Special of $55. Very disappointed when I got there and she pointed at the price list and said $55 was relaxation only and if I paid $75 I could have deep tissue. WTF? I should have gone to Holiday Blue Balls! Normally the receptionist doesn't take the booking so I was more than surprised when she followed me into the room! She said it had been quiet there with all the competition. Probably more so that two massage shops in the area have been closed down I would think.

This is one of those sessions I really wished I hadn't. Every time I talked Jasmine would stop massaging. I got the impression she didn't like to work. Even then she claimed this shop did better massages than Brighton. This would have to be one of the worst massages I have ever had. Very soft, she kept yawning and more interested in talking. I had some sort of attraction to her not sure why. She reminded me of a girl I used to see, who I ended up doing BB a few times. I doubt she would go that far. On rollover she kept massaging me around my stomach, legs and close to my balls. Pointed to mister serious and asked if I wanted any massage there. Sure how much? Standard $30 here, or $50 with a clothed touch, which she dropped to $40.

Jack hammer approach and I had to show her how to slow down. No touching under her bra which was a shame as it felt like she had some fairly decent sized puppies hiding under there. Finished me off, then kept looking at the time saying how the clock was slow.... wiped me down and I left her a tip which made her very happy. Complimentary water on exit.

5/10 massage

WIR? NO!

As I walked out there was a couple waiting for a massage and I saw a very cute looking girl waiting outside the room. Just my luck I was thinking!

Rnt's can seduce even the hardest critic of them, being both of us lol.  But this is the only one you usually submit too, so hats off to you for that.

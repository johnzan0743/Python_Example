My experience/comments : This place has not long been open, it's near work so I thought I'd stick my head in and see what the go was.
Promising sign when I was greeted buy a pretty young thing in a very tight mini dress.
Asked to follow her up stairs, very nice decked out establishment. But it smelt of cooked rice down stairs, upstairs was more pleasant smelling.
Paid my $40, was asked to strip and she would be back.
Massage was okay, more of a firm rubbing than a massage. Next was the flip, was asked if I wanted extra. I played dumb and replied with "you do that sort of thing?"
She said yes, and asked again would I like. I asked how much, she said $30 but I got her to agree for $20. Asked if she did topless or nude and she giggly said no!(wish she did though, she had a great figure) Not sure what other girls are like as they were either busy or hidden away.
Job done, cleaned up with a hot towel and was left to vacate the premise all on my own.
Not sure if I will go back, maybe just a little to close to work for my liking.

Value for money/recommend? : Ok

It has been a little quiet for me on the punting front but actually needed a massage this week. Having had my eye on a new place that has opened up, I decided to give them a ring and got a booking. 

The place was fairly nice and had a legit feel about the place. My masseuse, Eva was friendly in greeting and directed me to follow her which was a nice thing as she was in a pretty red dress that enhanced her tits and showed off her curves. She had a brief chat with another girl (couldn't see her but meant there were others) before leading me upstairs to the massage room. Eva laid out the towels at that point (fresh!) and left me to get ready. 

Coming in, a towel was laid over my legs but didn't really cover much. The massage was decent, I requested a hard massage as I was in need of some work on my back. Reasonable massage but lots of oil applied. Lots of focus on the legs and she was definitely not shy with the butt massage and brushing of the tackle. On the flip, the towel was put on again which was confusing. The massage at this point had changed to sensual rubbing of the chest and stomach. Once more, she moved to the legs and the towel was slowly removed. The "accidental" brushes kept going on.

Eva had not chatted much at all to this point which didn't bother me. Even with my hard on, she didn't actually say anything or offered the extra. Giving up on the pretense, I asked for extras and was told $40. Did my best to negotiate $20, then $30 but she just kept smiling and rubbing the legs without budging (massage was $60 for the hour). Gave in eventually and went with the $40. Her HJ technique though I must say is excellent. Two handed action, a good amount of ball playing mixed in with sensual touching of the rest of the body. No nude option was available to me and while she was happy for me to touch her around the ass, her breasts were obvious no goes as she kept moving away everytime I got close. 

Got the massage i need from a pretty girl with a good quality HJ to end. Guess I can't complain. WIR.....probably as it is so damn convenient

Damn wish I had Jenny, she greeted me at front in that so short mini and loved the view up the stairs following her, then she left saying enjoy in a very seductive way.  In came an older girl nice tits but just straight massage with occasional brush of it but no offer of extras

My experience/comments: great girl, not great English but was very open and honest. We spoke thru massage and was a delight to be with. Allowed lots of touching, felt regular customer would get a lot more action.

Jenny was fully clothed but had a beautiful tight bum I was allowed to grab. Initially she did a little brush of my friendlies.

She was very nice and friendly.

When it came to the flip, she was pretty quick to oil up my member.

Was not rushed at all, she was actually one of the better younger ladies I have seen.

They also had a shower facility that was nice.

Did hear noise like full service in other room. Place is beautifully clean. Worth the visit. A little expensive but great experience.

No They don't...AFAIK.

I've been with 2 girls there. One was Ruby (I think) - more of a chubby, mature Viet lady. It was so so, HJ provided, paid about $30 for extra.

Also stayed with Cindy(?) I think...she's a girl from Taiwan, FOTB with realllly little English, spent most of the session trying to understand each other. Also received HJ for $30 (although she tried to hit me for $50!!). 

Haven't gone back due to how exposed the front entrance is, but tempted to try Jenny...

Have heard about stuff going on in the carpark out back from local business owners....... This place might not last to long if the authorities get wind of it.

What could possibly be going on in the car park that couldn't happen inside the shop?
Burnouts?
Illegal parking?
Dogs left in cars on hot days?
Do tell please.

Agree, the front of this place is way too exposed.

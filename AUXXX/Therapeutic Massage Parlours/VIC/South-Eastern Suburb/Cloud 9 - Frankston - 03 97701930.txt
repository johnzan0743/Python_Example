My experience/comments : new shop on hwy at frankston went the other day and paid for an hour but girl never showed up so got my money back and promise of discount next time. Saw Anna very pretty girl in shorts and blouse ,told me to leave underwear on ,bad sign when she came in she put 3 more towels over me another bad sign. It was her first day there but gave me an excellent legit massage but nowhere near any sensual parts,mainly neck,back and lower legs. Got full 45 mins but no flip and no hint of extras . Nice new shop well set up ,haven't got many girls working yet ,even gave a receipt,first time ever.

Age 25 ish

Size/shape : Slim 6, Sexy!

Nationality or Ethnicity : Columbian  

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : good massage, that was all.

I thought I would check this place out. The girls are very sexy and do a good massage but as far as I could see they do not offer anything extra.
Nice new building. All the massage rooms, the walls don't reach the roof. So you can hear what the people outside and in the other room are saying. Was that you in the next room huggy? haha.
Good massage and sexy girls I might return if they get different girls. All in all a fun experience but not a good place if someone was looking for a punt.

Pjur.

Is that the ad that said they're looking for someone to just walk in, take the business and lease over? Geez, they only just opened. 
Just goes to show that there are now too many of these places in the area.

My good friend Alice who i catch up with up at Box hill terminus, works at Jade massage on Thurs. So i popped into say hi, but she was not there. Was told she was working over the road at this new place.  Took a look, very small shop front in a small block of factories.  Alice asked me if i was staying and i told her no. Just wanted to check how she was doing, long open passageway, nice enough rooms, very open shop with lots of room.  Basically on the left as u head towards Burwood highway before Mountain gate shopping centre.  Got Alice's number and she told me she works in Mentone Fridays.  This is the Alice who has worked in Clayton, 733 Mt highway Bayswater, and 18a Boronia rd Vermont.  The tall cuddly one who has provided full service, mid 20's she is.

My experience/comments : It was pissing down and I wanted to relax so driving wasn't an option and I remembered this place from a review somewhere and thought that while in the area I would try it.

I have a penchant for Lomi Lomi and recalling that they did it here I thought that I would give it a try. Parted with $100 for 60 minutes and shown the room. Quick shower then asked to lay down by Angela. Now she is nice, real nice when you factor in her sense of humour which was sweet. Great English and a cheeky disposition. 

However the Lomi was crap. Lots of oil and gentle strokes over a quarter of the body at a time with no under body strokes. Wasted $20 because I could've had just a relaxation massage which is $80.

On the flip offered $50 for HJ and $80 topless or $100 nude. Fuck me NO. Especially given that there was only 15 minutes to go. 

I did manage to get her at $50 topless and happy with that as she has a beautiful set of C-D cups that stand up to close examination and I would gladly pay that again if it was for the whole hour. 
The HJ was sensual enough to get me over the line. 

I would return ....in fact I will to try and get a better deal. I suspect she may for repeat customers.

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

I'm a decent looking younger fella and I go to these things for a relaxing and all about me time.   Massage was fairly plain and nothing to write home about to be honest... we kept making eyes after the flip to eventually i asked what extras does she offer. With a bit of attitude she asks what I want, and I told her i wanted her to look after me.   She started to slowly play with my member and tease me. I grabbed her breasts at which point she took her top off with no hesitation. I said you obviously like me and i think youre hot how about you suck me as well. She asked for me for more money and I said I wasn't going to pay that and remained at the 50 for the HJ.  She remained topless and there was mutual touching. Eventually after plenty of teasing she gave me a BBBJ. Although I couldnt come in her mouth which I thought was fine. I gave her an extra tip of $20 for the topless and BBBJ and have since returned and asked for the same service at the same price. Average massage but great service at the end. So i guess it comes down to what you're after. I wouldn't recommend an hour massage.

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Sabai Massage - COBURG - Massage in Coburg, Massage, Hijama

Phone : 9044 1655

Hours of Business : 10am - 10pm

Rates : 80ph

Age : mid 20s

Size/shape : slim and curvy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Brazilian

Services Provided : Massage body slide spanish tug

Value for money/recommend? : yes

My experience/comments : I was working up this way and found myself with an hour to kill so thought why not find somewhere to occupy my time.  This place wasn't my first choice but glad I chose to stay here.  I was met by Pamela where I settled the financials and was lead to a room and left to strip off and hop on the table.  She returns and begins a very decent massage.  She does engage in conversation but isn't too chatty.  She worked out a few spots in my back which required attention and before I know it, I was asked to flip.  Now I have to point out, my initial impression of Pamela was pretty enough but as she was dressed in a flowy formless cotton dress which gave nothing away thought her frumpy.  As I just wanted to kill my hour to spare and still wanted a massage I went with it.  I was asked if I wanted any extras and inquired what was available.  I stupidly decided with my little fella and went with a bodyslide, with spanish and a tug for 100$.  When she disrobed, I was floored at how stunning Pamela actually was.  She's slim, maybe a size 10/12 but with curves in all the right places.  Now she knows how to move over you in a body slide and to use those curves of hers.  She began a slow tug whilst draped over me and when sensing I was close used her decent rack to finish me over the line.  I took the pro-offer shower and once done, returned back to work an hour and 20 later.

WIR: although expensive yes if I was in the area.

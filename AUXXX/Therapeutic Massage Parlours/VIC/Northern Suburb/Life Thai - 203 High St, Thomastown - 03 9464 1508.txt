My experience/comments : Had noticed this place for some time, right next to train station, went in and booked for half hour. Jessie is young looking, is a uni student and gave a half decent massage. It felt a bit too much routine-like, very much like she was just going through the paces. She was not very talkative and my towel was kept on at all times and I was fairly certain that there was nothing additional here. The back got a good work out and then (about 25 mins later) it was over. Was going to ask about the additional 5 mins and then decided it was hardly worth it. Would I be back? Um, no.

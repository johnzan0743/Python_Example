Services Provided : Massage with option for HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Not for me

My experience/comments : Saw their ad in the Leader and was in the area. Went up, clean, newish, and went into a reception area greeted by Chinese Mamasan. I decided on a 30 min. massage, and was presented by a masseur in her early 50's (bummer). Taken to a large massage room that looks too big with draw curtains for partitions.
Stripped down to underwear... That's all I was going for with grandma today. As I surveyed the surrounds, it appeared to have many Thai style accessories mixed with Ikea, and just a sprinkling of countryside Chinese "we'll use that corner for storage" decor.
The curtains were sheer as having nothing at all, so, not knowing the outcome, I just went for the therapeutic option.
The lady was pleasant, but was not a real masseur (or one that isn't very good). When she started on my legs, she dragged off my underwear, and continued. Light nail touches of my scrotum indicated other things lurked. Eventually, flip time. I have a towel over my mid-region, then grand pads my package and says "you want?", my responses was quick and to the point; "no". Surprised as she was, she continued with the massage. She remained clothes throughout. She did try and get a rise, but she could of put a gun to my little head, and nothing would of emerged.
Finally finished, I got up and changed.
As I was leaving, I noted a chubby youth with way too much makeup going off to do a massage.
I suspect there is a little on offer, but they don't have the staff that inspires me.

To anyone else, good luck.

I was going here the other day but they were closed at 5pm.  So i think they open and close during the day if it's not busy.  

Their ad says "young girls".  50 is quite a stretch.

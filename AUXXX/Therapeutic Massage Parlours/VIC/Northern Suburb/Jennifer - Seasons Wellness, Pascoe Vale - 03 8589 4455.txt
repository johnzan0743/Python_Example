After a bit of driving around and visiting some dives on Victoria St, Abbotsford with none to my liking, I thought I would try this one in Pascoe Vale on Gaffney St.

Arrived and the front door is locked with a sign to go around the back. Walked around with a building site on the opposite corner, getting around not noticed. I rang the bell and the door was opened by Jennifer whom I asked on their availability. There was her and a Korean girl that was busy.
The place is a mess and is asking top dollar where others offer more pleasurable surrounding. There must be more on offer here.

The massage was ok and then came the question..Would I like extras? $50 hj, Nude $100, BS and touching allowed $150..She was dreaming..I laughed.. Massage continued with an average wipe down...

There must be punters willing to pay the price...

I have been spoilt with my haunt in Station St and Preston.

Indeed, who are these fools they must be out there. Thanks for the review elfang, one for me to avoid.

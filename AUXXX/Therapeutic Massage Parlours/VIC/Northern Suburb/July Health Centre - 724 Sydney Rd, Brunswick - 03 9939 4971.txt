Person's Name : Linda

Establishment : July Health Centre

Date of Visit : 28/12/2012

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :724 Sydney Rd Brunswick VIC 03 9939 4971 ( also advertised in the Moreland Leader as July Therapy - Moreland Leader can be found online )

Hours of Business : 10 AM till 8 PM

Rates : $60 / hr + $20 extras

Age : 33-35 ( I might be wrong. I really am very bad at estimating the age of people from an Asian background)

Size/shape : Probably 10

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Full body massage + a mind blowing HJ

Value for money/recommend? : YES! A great massage  with an out of the world HJ experience

My experience/comments : Really wanted a nice massage and was heading towards Reborn therapies (with return discount voucher) in North Melbourne when I saw this place on Sydney Rd. As I was feeling lazy to drive I thought I might give this place a go. Upon arrival I was greeted by an old Chinese lady ( probably 90 years old - she looked really old) and then, Linda came out of hiding and ushered me into one of the massage rooms. I paid $60 for an hour and requested for a firm massage. Her technique was good and pressure was adequate. She spoke English quite well. We had a little conversation while she massaged. Her massage almost put me to sleep. It was an amazing massage. Finally the flip and then she asked if I wanted a HJ to which I replied Yes and she said $20 extra to which i readily agreed. She took her top off and she let me fondle her nice cute tits. She also let me rub her down there and she was responding! She went on with my fella for a good 10 mins while she massaged my perineum and fingered my back end. That really felt amazing and I wanted to enjoy that sensation for a tad bit longer but couldn't control myself and blew a HUGE wad. Phew!!! Had an awesome body shaking orgasm. It was one of the best ones I've had till date. Then the remaining 20 mins she gave me a super-relaxing head massage and this time I dozed off. She woke me after the time was up and cleaned up the oil. Got dressed and while I was leaving she winked at me n said " I'm sure you'll return". I left the place relaxed and with a BIG smile on my face.  
Hell yeah I'll return. Hoping to get something more the next time around I see Linda. Will keep you posted guys.

Cheers

On the off chance, I went there yesterday to see what the punt was all about. Being Sunday it was quiet, to be greeted by and older Chinese lady with glasses in her 60s I guess.
I asked if there was anyone there doing massage and said she was and to try... Well I said goodbye and thank you ..Will try another time ..
Happy Punting

I reckon you were lucky.  I've tried this place during daylight hours on weekends and also on several weeknights with no hint of joy, despite asking.  Thanks for the report.  Good to know.

Thought I would check out this place (and Linda)...here's my review


Person's Name :   Linda

Establishment :  July Health Centre

Date of Visit : 11/10/2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink :   724 Sydney Road, Brunswick

Hours of Business : 10.00am to 10.00pm

Rates : $40/half hour clothed massage

Age : 35-40

Size/shape : size 8, 

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided :  Massage (clothed) + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Not bad

My experience/comments : Based on the positive reviews here, went and paid a visit. An Aussie girl with tatts greeted me at the door. I asked if Linda was working and she said yes, take a seat for a few minutes. After 5 minutes Linda came out and asked if I wanted massage. Bit older than I thought would be...led me to a curtained booth, very small with just walls separating and open at the top - not your ideal punting environment! Stripped off and lay down;  Linda returned and asked what type of massage I wanted. Went for firm and she proceeded to give a pretty decent massage. Linda was pleasant enough and after about 15 minutes or so asked me to turn over and I asked the question about extras and she said "happy ending only" and after more questioning found out that there was definitely no more on offer...no gear was coming off either despite some playful hints that Linda laughed at but would not budge. Not private enough anyway here IMO. HJ was $20 extra and was pretty good. Overall a pretty good experience but nothing special that would make me return in a hurry.

I have tried the girl with tatts - Christie. Her massage is average and HJ is an extra $20. I am happy that I can pay $20 for a tug without having to haggle

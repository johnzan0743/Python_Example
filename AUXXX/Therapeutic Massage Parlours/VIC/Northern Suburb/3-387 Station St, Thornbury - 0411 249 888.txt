So I'm feeling like a massage and some fun so I go along to see leanne and her girls, apon entering I'm greeted by Ming/Mig? the usual fair at this place pretty, nice short skirt and stockings, takes me to the room and leaves, now this is where it all goes down hill, in the background the Papasan yells somthing out and in enters Emily now she was sweet and pretty but that's it, for some reason she was dressed in a skirt that was below her knees and way to big for her, not a good start, we greet and she tells me she is new and has been working for 2 weeks or so, she ask's soft or medium to which I reply medium, my shoulder was a bit sore today, so she starts to massage if that is what you would call her technique, is was lousy hardly any presure at all, funny thing was I kept telling her, shoulder sore please massage there and because of her limited english she thought I was saying not so hard on my shoulder It's sore, anyhow I'm laying there getting a rub which is really her hands moving all over my body and It's not even sensual and for the first time in a punt I can't wait for it to finish, all along as she massages she keeps asking is massage good do you like this and so on, I lie and tell her it's ok, before the flip she gets a towel to wipe me down "COLD" the fucking towel is cold, now I don't know about you punters but that's a deal breaker for me, she wipe me down and ask's me to flip so I'm laying there and no way was I hard the cold towel killed that anyway she gives me the tug sign I say yes, bad bad mistake she says $20 dollars for tug I tell her I know and that I've only been here a zillion times but she tells me again $20, poor girl just didn't understand, ok I say, now I've had some tugs in my life but not like this rip snorter she gets me hard (It took ages) she grabs me and stars to tug but not just tug but! how can I say this just like a v8's car piston just after you've floored it, full speed up and down a million miles an hr my dick was getting red raw, shocking for my poor old dick, at this speed or pace there was no way she was going to get me over the line so I tell her how I like it, a bit like this and a bit like that but still she can't get me over the line, I tell her to leave it and not to worry about it, by this stage poor girl was sweating like she had run a marathon she had 2 hands going and all sorts of variations to her technique trying to rub my ass and balls but today they just weren't working, 10/10 for enthusiasm but I tell her to stop and wipe me down!!! yep you guessed it the towel "COLD" as she wipe me down she tells me in her best english how she had given 5 massages today and only 2 got over the line and 3 went beging not surprising, as she is cleaning up, Ming walks in (damn I say) she is hot, I tell her I want to book her for a massage she smiles and says yes, I pay Emily and of I go thinking about Ming.

P.s Emily declined to take the extra $20 because "not finished" which was fair enough, in case you're wandering she had no tits at all or very small she did let me have a look and touch and her ass seemed nice and small under that big dress, she might improve with time and practice.

p.s.s Has any body seen Ming? please review or pm me that would be fantastic.

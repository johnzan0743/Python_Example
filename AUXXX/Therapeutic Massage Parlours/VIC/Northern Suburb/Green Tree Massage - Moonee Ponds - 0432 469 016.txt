My experience/comments :

Well in Melbourne again for a few days staying in the general vicinity. Was here last year and only place I found was the chinese joint at 219 Ascot Vale Road, thought there would have to be better options.
After a bit of research had 5 places in and around Moonee Ponds so set off on foot to check them out.
Chose Green Tree Massage and entered to be greated by Amy. Shown to a room, full height walls and locking door, a good start!
Stripped and lay on the table, Amy returned and started a very nice relaxing massage, firm and sensual. After about 40 minutes she asked me to turn over and if i'd like extras, I suggested she take her clothes off which she duly did.
Tried to progress, offered her a massage but did not get far, eventually lay back down for a very pleasurable tug, she obviously knows her way around and perhaps with time will offer more.....
She got another $50 for the nude and HJ.
Certainly a very attractive girl, nice conversation and some fun!

My experience/comments :

I have been a regular in this place and mostly with Selena. I think she works there almost everyday and we had a pretty good rapport. She would escort me to the room, lock the door and immediately both of us strip off 
She has a very responsive body and to my fabulous fingering ehehehe and we would do almost everythign apart from FS and BJ (she doesn't seem to like BJ ah well..) .. I am most certain her orgasm is not faked and welcomed me to come on her breast. We would just play around in the massage table, kissing, mutual HJ so this girl is a star! Keep in mind YMMV and as I said before I am a regular.

Started with a mediocre massage - far far too many of those around these days and about 1/2 way in I asked about extras and she offered hj for $50.  We ended up setting on a nude hj which was quite good.  Afterwards we had about 15 min to go and she massaged my head and back some more and the standard improved no end.  She went for the full hour which was also a nice change over most of these places

My experience/comments : This was my second time there and I was greeted with a girl with a flowery tattoo on her shoulder..She was lightly dressed, which was a good sign. I went for the half hour and tipped $50. Massage commenced and she had great hands...ten mins into the massage I started touching her and she did not complain.
I asked for more..hj and nude..she said that she would not take off her clothes but I could feel.
Feel I did, exposed those magnificent breasts and sucking, feeling her wet pussy that got wetter by the moment to the point she could not concentrate at the job at hand..I turned over and she gave a magnificent milking whilst I fingered her...lovely
Rolled over and the massage progressed...I would recommend .
Shame there is no shower facility.

My experience/comments : 

Rocked up mid afternoon and was greeted by a lady who said she was 35. Got into the room and she said she was very busy at the moment and that I'd have to wait a bit for massage. Waited 10 mins and laid on table with no towel. She does a light massage, a bit of ass play but no oil, was a alright. Then she said flip over and motioned with hand if i wanted a tug, she wasn't bad. She got oil ready and started pulling me, then the door bell rang and she left to greet a lady (from the street, it looks like a legit place). She came back and finished me off. She was wearing jeans (I always prefer leggings with girls) and got to play with her pussy outside her pants. Then she increased speed and I erupted. Cleaned me up with tissues. Paid 40 for hand relief. Overall $80, not bad. She said that since its holidays, there are no younger girls working. I want to go back and try and young girl. Overall 6/10.

Been here a few times. Older lady (Angie) who I have had before was there and greeted me and said Selena was available and will be done in about 5 mins. Waited in the lobby for few seconds and Selena came out. Tattoo on her shoulder and was wearing black leggings with white top exposing her jugs. Massage commenced and she gives a decent massage.  She started on the back with a bit of ass play and then asked for the flip. I asked if she did extras and said HJ for $40. Flipped and she let me feel her through the leggings as she was milking me. Got to feel her nice camel toe, she was slowly jerking it which was good. She let me pull her leggings to her knees and finger her. I finished and she let me finger her until she squirted. Not the hottest girl but great body. She loved getting fingered. Cleaned up with tissues and off I went.

Value for money/recommend? : Perhaps

My experience/comments : 

I have walked past this place quite a few times, generally in the evening and the door has always been locked.  Today was different, Saturday morning and they had just opened.  Walked in and my immediate impression was a "classic" Chinese RnT shop.  Mamasan greeted me with a huge smile, and as soon as I agreed I would like a massage and paid my $70, grabbed my arm in a vice like grip so I couldn't escape and dragged me straight into one of the rooms which Monica was just setting up.   Mamasan said "Monica will massage you", pushed me into the room and exited stage left.  Now this was a somewhat interesting experience as Monica was dressed in pretty scruffy looking clothing, had her hair up in plastic curlers  and her immediate response appeared to be one of shock and dismay - I never did find out which.  Monica appeared to be i her late 20's, very plump, short with large breasts and a rather plain face.  I considered bailing, however, in the spirit of TOFTT i decided to stay, particularly as experience tells me some of the less attractive women can in fact provide a better service.  

Monica and I had a bit of a chat while she finished setting up up the room and she seemed to settle down and got quite chatty.  She left the room while I got undressed and came back minus hair curlers and in cleaner and neater clothing.  Monica offered nude RnT for $30 extra to which I agreed.

Having sorted out extras, I settled down on the table while Monica removed her clothes with the exception of panties.  For the price, I wasn't going to argue re the panties, I was more interested in the massage and tug standard.  Now, it was a cold morning in Moonee Ponds and Monica was using cold oil so the initial experience was not good, however once the oil was applied Monica actually had quite a good massage technique.  Smooth, sensual and the right sort of pressure.  Quite early on she introduced plenty of reach through TT mixed with crack attention.  Generally quite good - had plenty worse in my time.

At the half way mark, Monica gets me to turn over and does a pretty good front massage legs, chest and stomach with increasing attention to little Ant building up to a quite good HJ.  Monica said I could touch her anywhere but quite frankly I wasn't all that interested.

Clean up was a little problematic as the shop only seemed to have small hand towels and Monica was hopeless at oil clean up. I had the send Monica back several times for more towels before I had got most of the oil off.  Out the door on the 70 min mark with a big  smile and thank you from Mamasan.

Monica works Tue/Sat/Sun BTW.

Summary
"Cheap and cheerful" Chinese RnT.
$100 for a 60 min Nude (almost) RnT is a good price.
Very public entrance.  Hall St can be quite busy during the day.
Interior is somewhat run down and heating not up to the mark.
WIR? Possibly if I was short on time or $.  Or just wanted to try one of the other ML's.  I don't think I would return for Monica

Hours of Business : 10am Â– 8:30pm. Monday to Sunday

Rates : $70/hr plus $30 tip

Age : Early 20's I reckon

Size/shape : Slim size 6 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided :  Clothed RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Yup

My experience/comments :

Thought I would try this place again.  Walked in without appointment, young Asian girl behind counter (Jessie) who took my $100 (70+30) and escorted me to the back room.  I noted this room was larger and in better condition than the front room I was in for my previous visit.  Jessie left me to get undressed and when she returned she had my $30 change which I left on the table telling her this was a tip for her.  Jessie seemed quite pleased by this and we settled into a pretty good massage.  I asked for medium/firm and Jessie did a very good job WRT the therapeutic side of the massage.  While I was on my stomach, Jessie delivered a pretty standard general massage from neck to feet. increasingly she ran her hands between my thighs and provided some light TT, however at no stage did she reach through or massage little ant at this stage.  Despite this, I found the first half of her massage very enjoyable, sensual and good value.

On the flip, Jessie gave a really nice flowing leg massage which moved up to my stomach and chest via little ant.  She kept this up for some time going from my legs to top half and back down again with a gradual increase in the time spent lingering on little ant, which I found really nice and sensual.  Eventually all good thing have to end and Jessie now focused on delivering a pretty good unrushed HJ.  

Clean up with wipes followed by a hot towel and out the door right on the hour.

Summary
Jessie is a sweet little thing, somewhat reserved, may warm up with familiarity.As I was leaving, Mamasan checked with me that I was happy with the service.Re other extras - I asked Jessie and nothing other than clothed HJ was available from her.Jessie generally works after 4 pm weekdays and all day Saturday.WIR for Jessie? - yes.As always YMMV

Hi Ant,

You beat me to the review.  I had a session with Jessie last Thursday.  I agree with you basic outline on her, but can give more details.  She works only Thursday and Friday after 4pm and all day Saturday.
She has a very warm personality which sensationally matches her firm large C's or standard D's.  No gravitational pull on these babies yet.  She has inverted nipples that take a little coaxing out, but worth the effort.  I will return soon to take up an offer for some DATY time and report back.

I do however agree - Jessie is a great girl; maybe a little shy at first.  Uses a little too much oil, but is willing to learn the ways for her craft.

Services Provided : Nude RnT - left panties on

Value for money/recommend? : I guess so

My experience/comments :

Was in the area and walked in without appointment, Mamasan came out, recognised me said hello and escorted me to the front room.  Mamasan confirmed I wanted 1 hour took my $ and left me to get undressed.  As I was undressing, who should walk in but ....... Jessie with my $30 change.  We said hello and I asked upfront re extras and with a bit of hesitation Jessie agreed to nude for a $50 tip and I could pay her at the end.   Like last time, Jessie gave me a pretty good massage. I asked for medium/firm and Jessie did a very good job WRT the therapeutic side of the massage. While I was on my stomach, Jessie delivered a pretty standard general massage from neck to feet. increasingly she ran her hands between my thighs and provided some light TT, however at no stage did she reach through or massage little ant at this stage. Despite this, I found the first half of her massage very enjoyable, sensual and good value.

On the flip, Jessie gave a really nice flowing leg massage which moved up to my stomach and chest via little ant. I reminded her re nude and she removed her top and slacks then resumed massaging me.  I suggested removing her bra which she hesitatingly removed and returned to the massage - I gave up on getting her to remove her panties .  I reckon Air Travel must have had a different Jessie as this one has B cups with lovely puffy nipples which she is NOT interested in having touched.  I noted Jessie seemed somewhat ill at ease with most of her clothes off so I kept my hands to myself, complemented her on her body and let her on with it.  Her HJ was OK  but not as good as last time as she seemed less interested and it was more mechanical.  

Like last time, I found Jessie somewhat reserved throughout the session and not really interested in having a conversation.

Clean up with wipes followed by a hot towel and out the door right on the hour.

Summary

Jessie is a sweet little thing, somewhat reserved, not comfortable with nude.Re other extras - I asked Jessie and nothing other than clothed/nude HJ was available from her.WIR for Jessie? - maybe but I wouldn't bother with the nude option next time.

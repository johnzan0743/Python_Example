Person's Name : Sarah

Establishment : Thai Hand from Heaven

Date of Visit : 20/9/14

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 223 St Georges Rd, Northcote - 03 9486 8726 - :: Thai Hand From Heaven ::

Hours of Business : 10 am - 9:30pm

Rates : $80/ 60 min massage + tip.

Age : 20s

Size/shape : slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage+

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

Had some time and was in the area, recalled someone posting an enquiry about this place, so decided to investigate. It looked legit from the outside, and I am having some back trouble, so I thought it was probably worth a shot regardless. Went in, the decor was strange. It was more like what you would find in one of those tea shops out Olinda way. There was an Aussie guy behind the counter, and I booked half an hour. He said that Sarah would be with me soon, and bring the change. He showed me into a room, with more of the odd decor (if you know that scene at the end of 2001 where he goes into the obelisk, and ends up in the room eating dinner, that's what I was reminded of in the room). Sarah then arrives, extremely pretty young Thai lady. Bit of a mix up on the room and the length (at least in her mind), nips out, all sorted, good, no mistake, in she comes, no change, no worries I'll sort it later. 

I ask her for a medium Thai massage on my back, pointing out where it's all a bit sore. She starts on the back, and -- this is the thing -- it was a really good Thai massage. Really getting into the spots on the back. I check the time and realize that 20 minutes has passed, so I ask Sarah to extend for an hour. This is all good. When she comes back in, I say that I would like her to finish off what she is doing, and then provide me with a 30 minute relaxation massage. This is all good, and understood.

She finishes her work on my back, and switches to a nice easy flowing style. Really good, very relaxing, I nearly dropped off. After a good 15-20 minutes of this, Sarah asked me to flip, and started work on my thighs. I asked about HE, but she said no she doesn't do it. That was fine, it had been a great massage anyway. I was then surprised right towards the end, when the massage went elsewhere, and matters concluded satisfactorily. We had run over by 5-10 minutes, so no clock watching here at this place. I left Sarah a $40 tip, as suggested by her, and then went and paid the chap outside an extra $30 for the extra half hour. (I realized later that it's $75/60 mins there, but as we ran over, I was none too fussed).

All good, and will return, even if the decor is a bit odd.

Cheers,
Dean

The forum tries to be fair, honest and reliable so we expect reviews to let members know whether it's a good prospect or not.

The situation in Victoria is different.

All members should be aware of the authorities enforcing the law regarding the provision of sexual services. 

Members posting reviews of services at Massage Parlours should be discrete in their reviews.

cl-dean's conclusion is a good model.

If there's any doubt members can ask via PMs.

No Victorian member should posting stuff like 



			
				 Any FS here boys ?
			
		

 and they shouldn't be answered in the forum.

So if this was a fruit shop, are we able to see and feel the melons on display? Also regarding the banana, are they only touched to see if they are firm or do they get sampled at all?

Person's Name : Jenny

Establishment : Thai Hand from Heaven

Date of Visit : 21/4/15

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 223 St Georges Rd, Northcote - 03 9486 8726 - :: Thai Hand From Heaven ::

Hours of Business : 10 am - 9:30pm

Rates : $60/ 45 min massage + tip.

Age : 30s? Unsure

Size/shape : Chunky would be the best descriptor. She's not fat, and has good tone, but not slim either

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage+

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : 

I had some time in the area, and knowing what a good time I had here 6-odd months ago with Sarah thought I'd give it another go. I went in and met Jenny, a 30-something I think (although afterwards I revised that down to maybe 20s based on skin elasticity), and got a 45 minute Thai massage. As with Sarah all that time ago, the massage was excellent, first class. A couple of good cracks on the back, and some deep tissue work led to me being in a nice blissful state. The massage itself went on for I worked out later somewhere in the 35-40 minute region. The only disconcerting bit was when Jenny popped out and took a long time come back with a bucket of hot water and towels to wipe me down. But a top notch Thai massage.

Upon the flip, and Jenny and I had a bit of a chat, and again a good conclusion was reached. Following on from johnnydtf's approach, I was able to exchange two pineapples for full access to a couple of melons and viewing o the seafood display. They were in prime condition, fully ripe, hence my elasticity comment earlier. Appreciate that's a lot for what was on offer but it was fun; if anyone wants more details please PM me. 

Cheers,
Dean

Person's Name : Bella

Establishment : Thai Hand from Heaven

Date of Visit : 23/1/16

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 223 St Georges Rd, Northcote - 03 9486 8726

Hours of Business : 10 am - 9:30pm

Rates : $75/hour + tip.

Age : late 20's

Size/shape : Tall and Curvy

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage+HJ

Value for money/recommend? : OK

My experience/comments :

I was in the Northern Suburbs and had seen this place advertised on Locanto, so I thought I would call in.  Some of the girls looks quite attractive in their ad.  I met the Aussie Guy at reception and was allocated Bella, a tall but big bodied Thai lady, at best I could describe her as curvy. She was nice looking but not the petite, stunning beauty I had hoped for. Never mind, service is the key though for me, so I followed her tall, large frame upstairs, optimistic of some fun.  Upon entering the room I was asked to strip and lay on the table and I duly did, with Bella coming back after a few minutes.  I had left my underwear on, not sure what might be on offer, but I was given an immediate clue when she insisted I remove my jocks.  Bella then began a really good relaxing massage, which also ironed out a few knots for me.  Her hands began to wander and then time for the flip I anticipated her mind.  $50 for HJ and another $50 for clothes off - I negotiatd down to a $30 HJ which she proceeded to execute with the most expert hand.  Her technique was good and though she remained clothed it was probably better (and cheaper!) as I could see plenty of skin bubbling out from her clothes.

Overall an OK good experience, excellent massage & finish, just not sure if I would return specifically to see Bella again.

If I read this correctly thats $105 for a fully clothed massage and handjob? Most places in Northcote Preston etc you will get a nude massgage and handjob for $70.00. I suppose its not bad if the massage is good though, thats always a bonus.

That's correct JB it was $105 all up, which is exxy.  My experience is  many Thai "semi-legit" venues push for a premium and somehow often manage to succeed. When I'm lying of the table totally relaxed I find it hard to say no.

Person's Name : Eve/Eva

Establishment : Thai Hand from Heaven

Date of Visit : 2/3/16

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 223 St Georges Rd, Northcote - 03 9486 8726 - :: Thai Hand From Heaven ::

Hours of Business : 10 am - 9:30pm

Rates : $45/ 30 min massage + tip.

Age : 20s

Size/shape : slim, bolt-ons

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage+

Value for money/recommend? : Ummm... see review. I have my doubts.

My experience/comments : 

I had an appointment in the area, and thought I would return here. Yes, it's pricey, but it's always a good massage, and generally the chicks are hot. So I booked Eve/Eva (she used both versions) -- a slim and petite girl with a pretty face. Into the room, had a very hard massage for about 15 minutes, really working through some knots. Come the flip, and I enquire about extras. Handed over two pineapples (what was I thinking, I was horny as hell) for clothing removal and satisfactory conclusion. Touching and kissing and licking was allowed. But there was something about her body shape and her pussy that wasn't quite right. In summary I'm not sure if I've had my first massage from a TS, which isn't my scene.

Eve works Mon, Tue, Wed here.

WIR? Not for Eve. On the way out I did meet the most curvy looking masseuse called Lisa. Might be worth another visit when I am feeling very flush...

Cheers,
Dean

I think they should be upfront about their girls. If they are ts or ladyboys. 
I know some blokes are into that, which is fine, but like you Dean, it's not my thing and I'd pissed off

Thanks Tripod.

To be clear -- I am not claiming that Eve/Eva is anything other than a female and has been all her life. I just was not sure...

Person's Name : Celine/Seline

Establishment : Thai Hand from Heaven - 223 St Georges Rd, Northcote - 03 9486 8726

Date of Visit : early May 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Thai Hand from Heaven - 223 St Georges Rd, Northcote - 03 9486 8726

Hours of Business : Not sure

Rates : $60/45min, $120 for extra (yes, too much)

Age : 20's

Size/shape : Medium height, sexy, B's, toned

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage, HJ, DATY

Value for money/recommend? : No, too expensive/but yes, recommend

My experience/comments : Travel along St Georges Rd a bit had read the reviews for this place so though it would be worth dropping in. Right near the tram stop so pretty easy. Did a walk in. When I went in Celine was lying back on the couch in the front and hopped up quickly. I though the looked pretty hot and hoped that she would be doing the massage. Name in book, time, $, etc. into the first room. Walls all the way to the ceiling. Stripped off, draped towel and relaxed. C cam after a bit and locked the door afterwards. First visit here so thought that was a good sign. How would you like the massage? Medium. Good massage, not great. They use good oil here. Has no scent and cleaned off easily. A few hints on the way through but not much. Although, a lot of the massage was buttocks and top of the leg. Flip, same. C set between my legs and worked the upper inner thigh until the banana (does this fruit thing help with obscurity...) display at attention. C asked if the fruit needed some work. Yes. $50 for hand arrangement but touching on outside unlimited. That was going well. Then, having stopped thinking, asked about tasting the fruit. $100 (all up) for all fruit on display. Then I asked how much to taste the fruit, $120 (all up). Ok. All the wrapping was removed and the fruit placed for tasting. Really tasty. The banana display was cleaned up and the other fruit wrapped back up. As I left there was another young attractive ML on the couch under the stairs playing on her phone and back in reception was C and another very attractive, long straight hair, longish face, petite, but strangely NQR young attractive ML. I wondered later if she was Eve. I think there were 3-4 ML's, all young and attractive. Will go again.

Person's Name : Julie

Establishment : Thai Hands from Heaven

Date of Visit : late April 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : as above

Hours of Business : not sure

Rates : $45/0.5h

Age : later 20's

Size/shape : Petite

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage

Value for money/recommend? : No / No

My experience/comments : Haven't been here for a while. Noticed embroidered towels and Julie had a little outfit on. Have had many a great massage here although mostly a bit too expensive. Place was fairly quiet. Front room. Despite being quiet it took a good 15 minutes for Julie to come in. Julie was on reception. Has a nice touch but very light. Would have liked that long hair brushing over my back. As it was, not the slightest hard on. Flip. I figure they have to work for extras and said no when offered. After a bit of upper thigh work I was thinking maybe, so enquired: $50 HJ, $100 nude HJ and $150 body slide. Usual too high prices. Asked if kissing her pussy was included in the body slide. Sorry, have period so no. Was thankful that only went the 0.5h and was out of there. Julie was a bit of a cold princess.

Person's Name : Rose

Establishment : Thai Hands from Heaven

Date of Visit : min Jun 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As below

Phone : As below

Hours of Business : Not sure

Rates : $65 for 1h massage, $150 for extras

Age : mid 20's

Size/shape : petite, super cute, great rack

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : massage, B2B slide

Value for money/recommend? : No / No

My experience/comments : It seems the more attractive the ML the worse the service. Didn't know the names of any of the girls working that day, a Thursday, so went with the flow. Was put in the backroom with the mattress of the floor. Fairly ordinary massage followed with no real suggestion of extras. Flip at the 30 min mark. Rose was watching the clock and at the 45 minute marked asked if I wanted anything else. What is becoming the usual price list of $50 HJ, $100 nude HJ and $150 B2B slide was offerred. As I was no longer thinking properly I went with the $150 option. Pay first please. Ok. Off comes the kit, very nice body. Slide starts and then starts working the HJ. Had to slow that down 3-4 times. Could touch the breasts but no where else. Turns out Rose is as cold as ice. Total waste of money (I know Jersybull). Rose totally did a number on me and knew it. Ok, you get that one. Thinking a new approach is required (like only contacting ads with WL's holding a card with their phone number - that has not been photoshopped in). If no teasing during the massage forget it, ML has not earned any extras. If payment up front is required, also forget it. If an option is taken up, find out what is included. The B2B slide can sometimes be highly enjoyable.

I won't pay $150 for a nude body slide. That's just me. I think if you want a good massage head to some of these semi legit Thai places but if extras important head elsewhere.

My experience/comments : This shop is in a street near the train station.  Parking close to the shop can be a little problematic on a rainy day.  Dropped in without a booking, Leah was behind the desk.  Usual conversation about do I want a massage and how long, Leah took my $ and took me through to a little cramped room, just big enough to walk around the massage table .  "Take clothes off I will be back soon".  I( do as instructed and sit on the table and wait for perhaps 10 min waiting for Leah to return.  She finally comes back, asks re soft/med/hard and off we go.

Leah has reasonable massage skills and delivered a pretty standard oil massage.  I tried to have a bit of a chat with Leah but despite her good English, we didn't get very far and soon lapsed into silence.  Other than some light brushes there was no TT to speak of unfortunately .  The back, bum and leg massage went on until 10 min before time up then Leah got me to turn over and asked re HJ for a standard $50 tip.  I agreed to this and she gave me a reasonable oiled HJ to completion.  

Cleanup was terrible, tissues, some wet wipes and a dry towel   Lucky I could go straight back to my motel room for a shower.

Summary:
Parking can be a problemCramped roomPretty average massageNothing that would entice me to return

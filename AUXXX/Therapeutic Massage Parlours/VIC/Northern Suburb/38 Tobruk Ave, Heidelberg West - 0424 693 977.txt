 My experience/comments :   I was in the Heidelberg area and was in the mood for some action and I found this place advertised in the local Leader. They advertised it as a "Soapy Bubble massage" so it got my curiosity and thought I would check it out. Called them up sussed it out sounded all right so drove there and it was an old house near the Mall. Waited for the all clear from locals walking around and ducked in went in the door which was open and was greeted by a PRC in her 40's I reckon with really bad teeth. Was about to do an about face then asked if their were any other ladies and she begrudgingly said yeah ok wait and a another lady came out who was about mid 30's with a nice smile. Not a stunner by any stretch but I thought WTF and away we went in the room. She said $60 for 1/2 hour massage so paid her the money and stripped off. Massage table had the hole for head (good) but was  small and I am 6ft 3 so was a tight fir. Room was pretty clean but bright as only had light curtains. Bella comes in and commences soapy massage with a slightly rough type sponge which she explains softens the skin before the massage. Then she dried this off and did a firm massage with some oil which was pretty good and sorted out a few sore spots. BTW she was fully clothed - was a size 12-14 I guess not a great figure in a dress but showing a little cleavage of her c cups which were ok. Anyway asked me to turn over then massaged the front and started to brush the tackle which got me pretty hard as I was relaxed and then she said how about a nude body slide and HR for another $40. She just didn't do for me so I politely declined and opted for a HJ which she said she would do for $10 extra as I was a first time customer. HY was great, really good teasing technique and lots of ball and crack rubbing. Anyway, she cleaned me up and off I went a pretty happy chappy.
 Bella had a great attitude and the massage & HJ was good but she was fully clothed and no great looker.

I was going to try this place a few weeks ago.They advertised as "Youth Bubble Massage" which sounded kind of appealing so I called up and made a booking.When I got there it was literally a revolving door with blokes going in and out and cars parked out the front on both sides of the street but no other cars parked in the street.I thought that if the neighbours weren't already wise to it then they soon would be.That,and the shitty appearance of the house turned me off pretty quickly so I headed off and didn't bother with it.

It's not the same ad,but it's definitely the same place.The ad I saw was in a Leader newspaper and they may have dropped the "youth" part of it as it was probably false advertising!

I havent been there yet but this sounds like the same amateur mob that had the private house in the same area of the Olympic Village a while back. That house had 10 or so washing machines out the back, didnt last long, not sure if police closed them or what but there were rumours they were being watched. Not surprised if this one draws attention from the authorities too given the amount of punter traffic reported by puntman above and the location right in among other houses.

I called this place last week and the lady (who sounded young) said there was several girls in their twenties working there that day...sounded promising.
When I got there about an hour later, a really average looking Chinese lady in her 40's with very bad teeth answered the door and there was not a young one in sight. She got really pissed off when I didn't want a massage from her!
I am not sure what happened but I suspect the the person on the end of the mobile you call is not even at the house. What a sham...avoid!!

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage; extras on offer but declined due to price

Value for money/recommend? : Perhaps. Massage was good, not brilliant

My experience/comments : 

Was in the area, and had been here before a while ago with varying success. I popped in, and this geeky Thai girl with a fair amount of cleavage on display came out of the waiting room. Fuggitall, why not, paid my $45 and was shown to a room.

What followed was a good quality (not outstanding) hard Thai massage. Sometime you walk out of a hard Thai massage feeling as though you have a new body. This was not one of those times, but the quality was good nonetheless.

I enquired about extras, but was put off by the price ($50 handy, $100 topless handy).

Kat was a pleasant enough young thing, English was passable, and seemed like OK value to chat to as well. She says she works seven days a week between here and the Essendon branch.

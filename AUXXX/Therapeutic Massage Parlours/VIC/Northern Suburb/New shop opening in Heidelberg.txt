The Mall is at 300 Bell Street Heidelberg, a report already exists on that address,

Are you reporting a second massage place at that address ?

So the question to be asked is there any extras on offer? Or no1 has tried yet and this is simply an awareness post of a new shop?

OK lucija123, where is it and what is the name of the shop. You started the thread and have generated a lot of noise.

You joined 5th October 2013 and made one Review with the provider's name on 30/1/14 then the series on 1 and 2 of Feb 14 all with no names, then the copious one line comments and this.

How about you post full Reviews of providers and establishments you have visited instaed of the series of rubbish you have been. This forum is for meaningful reviews and you rank is not determines by post count.

Be warned you have been noted and will be monitored!

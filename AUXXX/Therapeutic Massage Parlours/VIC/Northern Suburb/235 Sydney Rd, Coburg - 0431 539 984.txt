If you know the Post Office Hotel on Sydney Road then you probably know the great Turkish restaurant on the other corner across Reynard St (try the potato salad - best I've ever tried).

Well there's more good news with a massage shop next door to the restaurant.  I tried it on a Saturday afternoon and it was very quiet.  I'm certain the shop has been around for some time but I noticed it had different signage so I gave it a go.  Inside was fairly average - a downmarket office fitout and nothing fancy.  There were two rooms, both with glass bricks for light and it looked nice and clean.

I was met by Momo who was a stunning tal and slender Thai woman.  I grabbed her for 90 minutes and after a very long wait on the table she came in and immediately set the tone with lots of enthusiasm and affection.  A fantastic lomi lomi followed and some brushes and the rest and it was fantastic.  Momo is a very classy sot of lady and is very gentle.  I negotiated $50 HJ and my hands wandered a fair bit.

The tone indicated that further visits would take a positive turn and so I highly recommend this place based on my only visit.  There was another lass there, who looked to be an Asian woman in her late 20s or early 30s who was very trim and trendy.

Overall cost was something like $100 for 90 mins + $50 + $15 for going over time.  

WIR - you betcha!

My experience/comments : 

Thought I would check this place out, and arrived to find this girl asleep on the couch...I disturbed her best sleep..ashame
I decided to tried half an hour and was taken to the first room. Converted offices, but ok...

I received the worst massage ever with was more like tickling and a lot of arse work. Why I reached to touch her she moved away.
Anyhow came the flip and she pointed at the member, and I asked if she would do nude? She said $100, I looked at her said " your dreaming"
as she was nothing special and really did not know what she was doing. Apparently she worked in Oakleigh..

Wipe down and it was over, as I left I could see her in the back sulking....Bad luck as she should treat customers better.

On the Sydney Rd strip there are lots of parlours with a higher standard of service.

Forget this one..

Person's Name : unknown

Establishment : Feiyang massage

Date of Visit : 20/8/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 14 Young St Moonee Ponds 

Hours of Business : unknown 

Rates : $50-$70 30 mins

Age : mid 20's

Size/shape : slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Asian

Services Provided : RnT. Nude RnT.  

Value for money/recommend? : if you're lucky to get it for $50 then yes. But sometimes they charge for extras 

My experience/comments : Went to a place on young street in Moonee Ponds. Walked in, greeted by an Asian lady who led me to a room. Gave her $50 and she left. A minute later another Asian lady walked in (mid 20's. 6/10). Didn't ask for money. Told me to strip naked and lie on the massage table. Massage was sub par but lots of penis touching and even rubbed one out. Told to turn after 20 minutes. Another sub par massage on my front and finally a happy ending didn't ask about oral or FS. She cleaned me up and said next time it's $20 for ending.

Overall massage was 5/10 but I only paid $50 for 30 minutes and came twice.


WIR for $50 yes for $70 probably not.


Anybody else know a place around Moonee Ponds / Essendon / Strathmore or these areas for good value?

There's a place near Ascot Vale station, next to the Post Office/ Milk Bar on Ascot Vale Rd that sometimes offers good value.

Other than that nowhere near Essendon offers extras.  There is a new place on Pascoe Vale Rd near the Essendon pool that I haven't tried though.

New establishment on Syd Rd from a crew that run 2 other well operated parlous.

This was my second visit, the girl i wanted to see was not there so i went with Sarah, tall good looking blond , aged but still got it.

Payed my $40 and led to a clean room and told to strip. 

Sarah soon arrived , very friendly and chatty and straight into the business end of the massage , loads of rubbing, stroking and touching in all the right spots.

rather than a negation i just let it go until she was ready to offer services. I was asked how much do i wanna pay ? $50 is a fair amount i think so this was put forward. 

agreed to a nude tug in underwear, extra 20 had her on my face and stroking the old fella like a pro, pretty sure there was some ball licking action towards the end.

Easy, no hassle visit , clean and discrete. reasonable prices for good to great looking gals.

Date of Visit : 13/04/13

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 108 Sydney Rd Coburg  03 9972 3907

Hours of Business : 10am - 10 pm 7 Days 

Rates : $40/30 min , $80/60 min - price of extras over the roof

Value for money/recommend? : No way!!


Walked in and was greeted by an Indian man and a Brazilian girl. Was really looking for a good hard back massage. Paid $40 for 30 mins and was shown into the room which was an OK setup. Hated the fact that there was loud belly dance music being played..Aarrgh. Then the massage which was average and she was constantly trying to stuff her tiny tits into my face. The girl as a package looked fantastic and I liked what I saw. Then the flip and then she asked me if I wanted a special massage. Well, I said yes. Negotiated for nude and an extension for another 30 mins for $100. She asked me to take off her clothes and she bent down to get something and I went WOW!! Her perfectly round butt and the sight of the clean shaven slit sent me over the roof. Fingered her very wet n tight snatch while she gave me a tug. Tug was below average and then DATY which was good. No foul smell or taste and enjoyed it. Another session of tug and everything was over. She said "Come back next week and I'll have more for you. Wink". I am guessing FS? 
She got dressed, handed me a warm towel, asked me to clean up and walked out. I was like WTF ? I had to do all the cleaning myself. Walked out and spoke to the dude outside only to realise they aren't bothered. Paid the damages. Yes I know that was too much to pay. I could have just gone into 26 Hocking Street or even Pickwood Lodge. Hmmm. But all in all I wouldn't return as I can get a better massage and service at a fully legal establishment. Lesson learnt I guess.

Person's Name : Dunno, Asian girl about 30y.o.

Establishment : Massage Garden, next to Woodlands Hotel

Date of Visit : 17 May 13

Rates : $80/60 min , $30 HJ

Age : probably 30

Size/shape : thin side of average

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai / Indonesian (not sure)

Services Provided : Massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Nope.  I will not return.

I dropped by to see what the new local was like and to see if that Indian guy from Railway Ave Pascoe Vale was there.  He wasn't.  I had no option for who provided the service but I saw the tall Brazilian girl and she was tall but there will be no postcards written about her.  I ended up with the girl who was on reception an the massage was devoid of any pressure and whlst relaxing, it was pretty much rubbish and the HJ, when offered, was OK.

I will not waste any time writing more as this place is not real flash and is just another trap so go to 300 Bell St or Plenty Rd or High St, all of which are not far away and are better options for both value and experience.

Person's Name: Lilly

Establishment: Massage Garden - 108 Sydney Road, Coburg

Hours of Business: Open from 10am to 9pm

Prices: $60 for 45 minutes

Age: 25

Size/shape: 8-10

Nationality or Ethnicity: Brazil

Services: Massage + Tug

Value for money/recommend?: no way

My experience/comments: I came here last year some time around June. they have been advertising on Locanto alot this year and they are pretty much the same girls from last year. Lilly is Brazilian and has a really nice body. Last year i had one massage with her and it was $65 for 45 mins + 80 for full nude at the end with a tug. I thought id see her again, even though it was expensive she was pretty good and lets you touch where you like. So i get in the room for 45 min session and its all good pretty much just like last time. she doesnt rush but uses way to much oil. When it came time to flip she asked what i would like for extra and she goes over the prices. 

Wow, inflation has hit hard! $50 for Tug, $80 for topless Tug, $120 for Full nude Tug! i was shocked and just said im happy with just the massage. her massage is ok, not great, so considering the prices id much prefer to head to 300 bell or the 2 other places around that area as you get much better value and a way better massage. the one thing you dont get it nice looking south American girls. so it really depends on what your after. But 65 + potential $120 = $185 is crazy...see ya later massage garden

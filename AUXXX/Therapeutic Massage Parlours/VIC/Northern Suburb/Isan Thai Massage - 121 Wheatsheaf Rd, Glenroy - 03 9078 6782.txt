My experience/comments : I called in here as I had seen the place a few times and thought I would take one for the team.  However when I opened the door, the place looked old, which matched the lady behind the desk.  Scared that she was the only person on duty, I made my excuses, grabbed a price list and left.  Sorry gents, but if extras were available, I couldn't put mini me through it!

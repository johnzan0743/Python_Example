Contact Details/Address: 319 Victoria Street, Brunswick,

Prices: $120 ph for nude with HJ 

Age: 28

Size/shape: 8/12

Nationality or Ethnicity: Aussie

Services: nude massage/tug

Value for money/recommend ? good

I was in area and dropped in here on Saturday afternoon when told aussie girl is working. I am bored with asian and always seek aussie or euro so I had to see Shirley. Good looking girl late 20's or early 30's. Friendly. In room was given a choice of 80ph for massage, 100ph for rnt or 120 for nude rnt. was also offered exchange with no undies for extra 100 but declined as that was bit too much.

The massage was pretty average but she is a fun girl to talk to and didn't mind me kissing her body and sucking tits also wont allow any touch down. the Hj was good. 

Overall for $120 not a bad time, but I dont think $100 for exchange is worth as she doesn't allow any action downstairs.

Went to this place after reading previous reviews as I seem to be in a slump of legitimacy at the moment which I was hoping to break

Massage started firm with lots of effort then quickly turned into a gentle, lethargic 'dragging' of her hands over my back and legs.

There was no turn over or flip (back only) and the massage was one of the worst I've had - it lasted 22 minutes. When I questioned the girl on the time(who barely spoke english) she pointed to paper that had been slipped under the door saying "look, finish, reception leave note." 

Date 7/11 - lunch time
$50 / 1/2hour (22mins)
Sorry for the short review on this one but I feel the place doesn't deserve any more of my time!

Value for money/recommend? : Not bad

My experience/comments :

Decided to visit Pink Thai, which had been a regular haunt that I suspected offered a little bit more but had never had the luck. Go for a one hour deep tissue and get assigned Kylie who I was assured was lovely and sensual. I get in, strip off and put the towel over. Kylie walks in and she is fairly cute. She introduces herself and asks if I've been before, I say yes - of course and she starts. 

Instantly the towel is taken off and she goes straight for the bum. Lots of bum tease and tickle, plenty of oil. It was wonderful. The rest of the body massage was ok, but it seemed like she was only interested in my backside. She asks if I usually get massaged on the front and I say yes. I flip and she starts massaging around the old fella. A nice good tease. After about 10 minutes of this she asks if I want a Happy Ending, I say yes, we arrive at $30 and she goes to work. Her technique wasn't amazing, but her slim fingers and copious amounts of oil made it worthwhile.

I've heard that not all the girls at Pink Thai offer extras - but she certainly does.

Review: was back in Melbourne this month and thought I'd try Pink Thai again. Even if the ladies don't offer extras its usually a good massage anyway. was assigned Emma who who I was told was a bubbly, friendly of girl with strong hands. The woman that showed me to the room however told me to 'strip to my underwear' so I wasn't expecting much. 

Emma came in and we instantly hit it off. She had a lot to say and it created a nice relaxed atmosphere. She is a very pretty girl with a curvy body, a little larger but nothing to be sniffed at. She also sported a set of really big boobs incased in a tank top which were sending me bonkers. The massage started and was very good - the woman at the front desk wasn't wrong. Emma knew what she was doing. The big surprise came as she ventured towards my lower back. I'm not sure whether it was the rapport we'd made or that she does it with everyone but she yanked my undies down and started massing my bum. after a bit of this (which was great) she said - 'Should we just take these off?' I was a little shocked, bu happy, and said yes please. Then she started the teasing. Lots of deep slow strokes in my inner thigh and tickling of the balls which got me rock hard.  

When it came to the flip she laughed when she saw my hard on and asked if I wanted it taken care of. I agreed and we talked about the price. We came to $30 and on a whim - quite unlike me may I add - I asked if I could see her puppies while she did it. She said it would be ok if it was $50 all up. I was happy with that and she went to work. I will be honest and say that the combination of her oilly hands on my old fella and the sight of her swinging boobs inches above it meant that I didn't last too long. Emma cleaned me up and as we had more time continued to massage my front, teasing near my balls. 

All in all I'd recommend Emma if shes in. Not only was she skilled at what she does she was also very friendly and funny. And those boobs....

Rates: $80/hr + $100 topless/HJ/Nude with Touching

Services: Massage/Topless/HJ/Nude

Value: Oh Yes.

I had to go to Brunswick area for a client meeting. Finished that and was horny so decided to have some RnT. I have been to Pink Thai once before and they always are full of goregous mostly euro backpackers trying to make quick cash which I like as I am off asian as much as possible!

Walked in without appointment and was given a choice of a Jap and a German. Decided to take german sight unseen and boy did i make a good choice.

Maxi is 21 and absolute drop dead gorgeous. Looked like a Victoria's secret model - slim blond with a beautiful face and a sexy figure.

Massage was out of mind and after 10 mins of having a so called "massage" popped the question. Yup extras avl but pricey! $40 for tug, 20 more for topless and $20 more for touching. Wanted to keep pants on. I said how about I round it to 100 and you drop everything. Agreed with not fingering of pussy which I agreed to. The clothes came off and wow.. $100 well spend. Silky smooth skin and shaved pussy and a goregous ass and yummy b-c cup titties. Pulled her close for a taste of titties and she didnt mind me tasting them. She kept the massage going and I kept on exploring her silken skin.

Felt her pussy lips and while I kept my promise of no finger i did play with her clit and was rewarded with a wet pussy so she liked what I did even if she kept quiet.

Turned over and while she leaned over me for massaging my chest I sucked on those gorgeous tits and she just smiled.

The only bad part was that i was so worked up with her body that I lasted like 30 seconds. Cleaned up and left with a smile.

she works at their st kilda branch mon tue and thu fri and is here only 1 day - wednesday.

Even though total damage was $180 - IMO it was worth it and how many times we get to suck and feel stunning girls!

Value for money/recommend? : 50:50

My experience/comments: 

Nice looking place, went in and asked for a 60 minute massage ($80) and was told that they had a lovely Thai girl on (great), and was shown to an upmarket-ish room.  Not necessarily a good thing given I was after a RnT.  At any rate, off with the clothes and on the massage table without the modesty towel

A slim to medium asian girl came in and introduced herself as Paris.  We talked for a bit whilst she gave a very light oil massage (fully clothed) and then she moved to the butt cheeks.  I asked her if she did extras and she replied that she did.  $40. I asked for twice for $50 and she readily agreed.  Whilst she wouldn't do nude, I could touch her.

I did the flip straightaway and she performed an okay HJ whilst I felt her nice butt and legs.  She then massaged me for another 20 minutes before the second HJ while I felt her breasts.

Will go back

Value for money/recommend? : Yes to see other girls

My experience/comments
Hardly a Thai massage this place. There are a few aussies, backpacker girls, and some asians 


I went past the place and noticed it is showing its storefront as a thai   massage place? Booked for Sally, an aussie girl. I wasn't expecting   much to be honest, and was pleasantly surprised to find Sally is a very   attractive, pleasant girl with quite a body.

I stripped off leaving my undies and went to the massage table. While   she was oiling me away and gets to my b-b-behind trying to smudge it in,   and I asked if it's better for me to have it off (please, please be a   good response, my hear said). She said if it doesn't make me   uncomfortable? And off it goes 
She immediately asked if I want any extras, and who am I to say no  ehhehe.. paid $50 for nude and HJ, but no other extras on offer.
The massage was ok but a bit weak for my liking. Turned around and I sat   while she worked on my li'l bro. She was happy for me to fondle her   lovely breast (no nipple touching, she said gently). I worked very, very   close to her nipple area and can feel she is actually getting aroused   as she gradually leaning closer and closer to me until I can kiss her   hair and neck. The weather doesn't really help as she and I were   sweating crazy, but the relieve was welcomed.

Date of Visit : 3/4/13

Rates : $80 for hour. $100 for nude, HJ, BBBJ

Age : 21

Size/shape : tall and skinny

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean

Services Provided : Nude, HJ, BBBJ

Value for money/recommend? : Mmmmm

My experience/comments : I went here looking for some non asian rubbing. I lucked out due to the time I wanted, with only Coco available.
I was pretty happy when she came in - typical tall skinny asian with an ass like a 12 year old boy but with tits verging on a C cup.
Negotiated the extra's. I'm a sucker, yes, but fuck it I needed some good relief.
Coco treated it as two different sessions. First the massage, then the fun. She kept telling me to wait when I had wandering hands until the massage was done. The massage was not bad, not great. Maybe 5 out of 10. Only the very very occaisional flick of the sack. Certainly no ass play.
I was hoping the flip would signal the beginning of the fun but no, she wanted to finish a normal front massage first. Well I was commited by now, and let her finish.

Then off came the clothes, althought I had to ask for the panties to come off. SHe jumped up on top and did some sliding and licking and for a moment I though she was gonna pop the old fella in. No, she just wanted to rub it in the special place, but I don't go for that shit uncovered so had to stop her. I really don't see the difference in rubbing it down there and sticking it in health wise.

Anway, onto the BBBJ which was OK, not great, and she finished up.

All over not bad, but pretty bloody expensive.

Oh, and I determined that they own both Tokyo Milk and some other place in Richmond.

 Size/shape: tallish size 10 -DCup

 Services: Massage

 Value: expensive but nice

My experience/comments : Went in to check the place just last week and see what was really on offer. I did not want to risk much hence I went fro a 30min massage.. Nice place, clean, new towel before every customer. Frankie come into this nice small room, tall English girl big breast; She starts with the massage, nice massage to the back and we start chatting and she openly explained the rules of the game! She says "so that you know we offer extras" and she nicely give me a run down of the services. It felt a bit wired, very much like going to the supermarket. Frankie is a very nice girl not my type really hence I decided to go ahead with a normal massage, I did not feel like leaving $100 on the table for something not quite what I like. She however told me that there are other girls, the all offer a range of services some more some less and she give a description of some of them.. nice from her I would say! 

Has anybody else had any experience in this place? I like it as it is quite nice and clean and I am sure it is going to be fun however I don't think prices are quite negotiable...

Not a fan of waiting I must say.  Lola came in introduced herself and started the small talk.  I did have a sore back, so got her to work that for a while.  Lola then asked if I had any other areas to work on.  I rolled over to show and asked the prices.  Lola gave me the run down on the pricing (see above).  30mins and HJ and BBBJ I nutted over her stomach.  Good day had by all.

Value for money/recommend? : Not Really

My experience/comments :

Have been to this place a few times and it is really hit and miss. I found she was very ammo at the massage and didnt know what she was doing. There are alot better places out there, as i said this place is hit and miss so really depends on who you get. They are attractive girls though so that is one positive.

To elborate on this massage and the girl, she was blonde haired around shoulder length, nice sporty figure and very pleasant. She like to talk alot which after 20 mins got a bit annoying but she was nice enough. I was probably in the room for 5 or so mins before she came in, but the room was nice and comfy which helped.

When she finally got to giving me the massage is was so so, she didnt really know what she was doing but rubbed ok. The positive was that she kept tickling my balls everytime she went down the leg, which lept it interesting. After 30 mnins she asked me to roll over and focused on the shoulders and thighs and then asked if I would like any other region looked after. I obliged and she massaged the balls and shaft really well. She did know what she was doing there, after around 5 mins she really got going and withing 30 secs I had exploded everywhere.

Overall the massage experience was ok but there are better places out there to sopend your money on. The place was nice and clean though but dont think they had a shower.

My experience/comments : 

I had just returned to Melbourne on Sunday and thought the best thing to do after a stressful weekend was to get a massage. Looked on Locanto and found a number - go through the normal chatter and get the address.
I was told there were three girls working although I'm beginning to think this place is all lies. After getting there I swear I've seen this drugged out islander woman as a receptionist somewhere else but boy she is annoying. The way she slurs her words and makes them sound reaaaaaaaaaallly loooooooong lieeeek thiiiiiis. I asked for 30 minutes with Lola and got led upstairs into a terribly small, dark room with a speaker that was struggling to play music. After I strip down Lola comes in and squints her eyes trying to remember who I am. Having seen her last year on my birthday she remembers and tells me "now is my birthday today". Turns out her birthday was in fact a few days ago and she's actually left for France for a long time to work. She said when she returns to Australia she won't be doing this sort of work but you never know. But as for the massage, it was perfect. Spot on. Her mother is a therapist and made her learn a bit about it so she actually knows what she's doing. After about 10 minutes of massage she asks me to flip and gets straight to work. Jumps on top, strips down, oil on me and on her. Gives me a bit of a body slide and then moves onto a really sloppy BJ. After I CIM she gets back to massaging and then I'm on my way out of there as fast as possible. 

Overall: Don't know the place, knew the girl so I guess I got lucky. Wouldn't go there otherwise.

This place is part of the Tokyo Milk/Urban Kneads/Kung Fu Massage franchaise.

The price is not cheap, but when you do find the right girl, it's definately worth it. I've had some of the best RnT punts at Tokyo Milk.

The two top ladies at Brunswick is Serena and Kara. I've heard good things about Serena, and I've been with Kara a few times when she worked at TM. She provides a very erotic service.

$100 usually what they ask for, but if you negotiate politely you'll get away with $80. If they don't budge, then don't pay for it if you think it's too pricey.

Getting BBBJ/CIM included is a steal at $100! usually you'd only get nude RnT for that price at these places...

 Date of Visit : 19/6/14 

 Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 319 Victoria St, Brunswick  I have a phone number 9388 1441, but was getting a disconnected message, however they were still open.

 Hours of Business : 10am till 10pm

 Rates : $80 an hour

 Age : Early 20's, Black hair, nice face.

 Size/shape : A cup, Nice tight body.  A couple of small tattoos

 Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian

 Services Provided : Massage Lomi Lomi with Happy Ending, also does topless ($50 extra) and Nude ($100 extra)

 Value for money/recommend? : Yes - I like the non-manufactured, personalised approach.

 My experience/comments :

I have been to here a couple of time now.  I always try to get a different girl just to sample the pack so to speak.  This time, I went with Mel.  Quite a talkative girl, if you don't mind that sort of thing.  Didn't worry me, at least until the flip.

I had a legit issue with the lower back, and for a petite girl, Mel provided a great muscle relaxation massage, followed by a area specific firm massage that did relieve the tension for my back.  At the half way mark, I told her that no disrespect, but I don't go quick so might want to flip over and get started.

I went for the nude massage, and while it was great to take in the visual sight of her body, Mel was reluctant to let me touch too much down stairs.  DATY was out, which is my favourite, so a little disappointing on that score.  Personal note - DATY usually gets me off quick.  I guess that is why I like going to these establishments where the girl still doesn't have any lingering issues from the last customer.

Anyhow, back to the visit.  Mel had great hands on the flip.  Went straight for mini me.  Plenty of warm oil, which I like.  Happy for me to touch and play with nipples.  I think she knew to stop talking, and allow me to concentrate on the task at hand (pun intended).  She mixed up the technique, and got a little rough with the lollie bags.  Ended up shooting a reasonable load .

She then went and got plenty of warm moist towels for the clean up, but as previous reports state, there is no shower.

Overall 6.5 - 7/10

My experience/comments : Ok so im writing this all over again, My original post was at least 200+ words long and for some reason I pushed backspace and it went back a page and I lost all my review 

Well I will make another attempt but this time it will be a cut down version since im getting tired of typing. SO decided I wanted some White Chocolate this time round instead of the normal Asian MP's, so heard bout this place from a mate. Got into the convertible BMW and off I went to Brunswick. I get there and park not too far from the entrance, Walk up to the door and the door is closed. I gaze in and see someone at reception, I tap lightly and a Aussie chick comes to the door. She says hi and proceeds to introduce herself as Serena. She asks have I been there before (Rookies please note: Always answer yes even if its not true) I say yeh but its been a while. she say ahhh yeh cause I don't remember you, I'm like well that's funny cause neither do I remember you. I say the last time I was there was 3 months ago but some other girl was at reception. She asks what im after I say 45mins of heaven and hand her a pineapple and red lobster. I tell her to keep the $10 change and buy herself a coffee. She says 2 girls are free, Serena and Karen. I remember my mate saying Serena was a looker so I immediately respond with enthusiasm "Serena Please" she says, did Serena look after you last time, I say boy did she ever, shes number 1. 

I can immediately tell by Sienas response that she knows what goes on. Im taken upstairs to a room, I get the gear off and lie down. I waited 10 mins before Serena walked in, In walk a blonde looker size 10 with DD rack, Im like WOW, I gotta hold back cause my dick wants to venture to her cave. I was ready to drop a few hundred just to get my explorer in her cave. anywho. she says I massaged you befor yes. Im like yeh, she says what you after, I said you look after me and I look after you like last time (ofcourse this is not true it was my first with her but these small lies make them think its ok to do stuff cause u been before) she says $100 and Ill do nude + body slides + HJ Relief. I say sure. She gears down and present a nice little landing strip and a nice set of slightly saggy hooters (what u expect from DD's, they gonna sag a lil) I'm immediately hard as a rock and ready for action but I think let me test the waters and see if shes up for more. massage starts medium and my hands are venturing, she allows touching but tenses up thighs when im bout to let my fingers do the talking like a 90's yellow pages commercial. I back off a lil but since she didnt verbally express herself I tried several times more, access denied except for allowing a lil clit rubbing. I figure maybe that will get her in the mood, as im rubbing slightly she moves away to the back of my legs as if to say, don't touch, she jumps onto of my back and procceeds to do some effortless slides. 

Serena didnt seem much in the mood and was like she was just dragging herself through the rest of the work day. she alternates massage and lame body slides for about 25-30 mins and then tells me to flip. I do the flip and she sees me hard as a rock, she massages the surrounding area and then procceeds with hand relief, her technique was that of someone who was less than an amature, and it seemed sluggish and she looked bored, a weird thing she did was close her eyes, tilt her head slightly back and jerked me with almost fuck all effort, meanwhile I figured if I try and finger her that somewhat turn me on,  but she wasnt allowing access and was pulling faces when id touch, im  like whats up, whats with the faces, having a bad day, she says time of  month and i dont like fingers in me, I say thats not how u felt last  time and says yeh but then i asked lots of the girls here and they dont  allow it so i decided to make some changes (I figured by that responce  she probably didnt have her rags and was just saying that cause she was  not in the mood.) I was slightly put off by this and it took 15mins before I got over the line.  anyways I just got over the line just in the nick of time. She wipes me a lil with some tissues and asks if I want a hot towel, I say yes and she comes back and wipes me down. I hand her two pineapples and suit up and take off.

Would I go back? 

Not for her maybe some other girl, she didn't seem in the mood and she can be hot as fire and still woulden't try her again.

My thoughts: Id say Siena at the front seemed super friendly and was flirting when I walked in the Door (maybe she saw the convertible BMW) anyways I picked Serena based on a mates opinion of hotness, admittedly she was a looker but her lack of enthusiasm was a huge turn off, maybe things would be different another time but I aint willing to give her another chance (at least for a long time), might ask if Siena does massages next time she seemed like she would go the distance, plus as I was walking out there was a nice looking brunnete that I wouldent mind sinking my teeth into. Ahhh well better luck next time I guess. All in all, got over the line so I wont complain too much. Its pricey but when you want white girls or something different from the Asians, This is ur best bet if ur in it for a punt, albeit an expensive one.

Serena is Canadian. Looks like she's burnt out like Kara. They both used to provide a very good service (Serena used to play with toys in her sessions) but its obvious that they are just going through the motion these days. 

Sienna, the receptionist you met also provided a top notch service at Tokyo Milk. Probably the best (IMHO) after Sasha. Unfortunately she's retired for now...

Yeh, she seemed very burnt out, it was very much like she just didnt want to be there but had to for the extra 2 pineapples I handed over. Next time I'm there I'm gonna try pull out the Sienna card. I reckon with the right words I can get her to come out of retirement, even if just temporary, there was something about her that told me she was keen. The things she said, her good attitude, the flirting etc... I'll keep u guys posted next time I give this place another punt. See if Siennna is ready to play balls (pun intended)

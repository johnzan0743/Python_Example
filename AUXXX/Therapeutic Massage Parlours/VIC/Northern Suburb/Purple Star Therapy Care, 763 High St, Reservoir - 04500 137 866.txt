My experience/comments :
I was in the area on Friday at lunchtime, so I thought I'd pop in for a punt. 

I rang the number and was told there were 2 ladies working. When I arrived the older lady took my $50 for 30, but I asked to see the other girl. 

The mamasan called out for Annie who was dressed in a short black frilly mini over leggings with a baggy light white tshirt that showed she had quite a large pair of boobs hiding under there. The thought of discovering those beautiful boobs made me choose Annie. 

I was let in to the 3rd massage room from the front which had the usual furnishings: massage table covered in towels, side table with oil and tissues. I stripped down and hopped onto the table. 

What followed was a pretty lacklustre 20min oil massage consisting of her hands rubbing over my body from back and shoulders to butt, then legs. All attempts at touching her were stopped by moving my arms onto the table, so it was pretty clear I wasn't going to get very far. I tried talking to her, to charm my way into her pants, but her English was pretty poor. 

On the flip she continued her hand rubs and with 10mins to go offered the handjob for $30, no top less, no nude, no FS. 

I reluctantly agreed and she oiled me up and finished me off very mechanically. No eye contact, no sensual touch. She then cleaned me up and wiped my body before offering a drink of water which I accepted. There were no warm moist towels or offer of shower. 

WIR return? For Annie, heck no. 5/10, but there are other girls working there so who knows?

Not great value in this area. $80 will get you a lot more in most places, $70 even.

My experience/comments : Weighing up where to go in my quest to find somewhere local that will deliver the perfect massage experience I decided to check out 14 Young Street.  I have read several reviews which were not so favourable but decided to check it out for myself anyway.  The entry is relatively discreet in a narrow side street with plenty of parking nearby, so that's a tick.  Walked up the short path and pressed the door bell which didn't work, so I just opened the wire door and walked right into a long passageway.  The ML then appeared from the far end and showed me into one of what appeared to be 3 massage rooms running off the hall.  Jenny introduced herself and asked how long I wanted to stay, so it was $50 paid and onto the massage table with a fresh towel under me. Not wanting to waste any time, soon as she locked the door I asked how much for nude massage and it was a further $30 so she disrobed and revealed a nice trim body with A-cup and very long nipples.

The massage was  actually pretty piss weak. Jenny said she had only been doing massage for a week and it was quite evident.  She rubbed and patted all over, but really lacked any good strokes or system and I kept hoping there was going to be some crack and tackle play but it just didn't happen.  After about 15 minutes of that I decided it was time to turn over and see what else was on the menu.  I reached up and fondled her magnificent nipples and then let my other hand find its way through the forest to see what the state of play down there was and to my surprise it didn't take a moment for the top of my index finger to create a nice sticky wet patch.  It was going so well I sat up on the side of the table and was fingering it more earnestly whilst I sucked on her long nipples and she was frantically trying to pull me off with her oiled up right hand. . . but I already had other ideas as I lowered my head to DATY. I got the feeling she didn't really know how to handle me and sweet as it was, for one fleeting moment thought there may have been a chance to slip something else into her juicy box, especially when she said for me to lay back on the table with me thinking, she just might be going to climb on top.  Alas, it was her oily hand that grabbed my oily member and and I just laid back and scummed to what was a pretty average HJ.  Probably too much anticipation and then a big let down at the last moment.  Some further massage and small chat during the afterglow and it was time to head off into the sunset.

There is a shower available and Jenny works only on a Saturday.  In summary, looks 7/10, massage 6/10, HJ 6/10, DATY 6/10 and personality 8/10.  Jenny is a nice ML but needs some more skills that hopefully will develop with more practice.

I rang there bell a few times yesterday, and no answer, this shop must have been busy, or only one girl on.

Moonee Ponds seems to be a gold mind, I'm heading near by this place very soon this afternoon. DATY? lucky guy! Good read, thanks for the review.

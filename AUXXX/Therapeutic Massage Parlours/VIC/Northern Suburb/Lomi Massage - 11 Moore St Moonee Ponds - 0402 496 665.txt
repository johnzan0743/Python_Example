My experience/comments : 

Arrived around 4pm, parking was very difficult to find. Parked at the Woolies 300 meters away

The place is actually a house as you can see from google images, there's a side on the front of the house that says enter through the side.

Rang side door bell and was greeted by Fiona at the door, no smile, just looked like she was not interested in greeting me or asking me if i wanted a massage.

Ebony came from one of the rooms, she works as the receptionist from what it looks like. She said only Fiona is available so I went fk it, I'll go with it.

Paid $90 for 1 hr and was shown into the room, the place is actually quite nice. Its clean and has a brothel like feel to it

Massage started with Fiona pouring a gallon of oil on me to start the famous "lomi massage"

It didn't even take 5 minutes until Fiona asks if I want extra services. I told her that I just want to enjoy the massage and will tell her if i am interested in extras later 

She asks "Why not now? I can't do only a massage for 1 hour" and I'm like "thats what i paid for!"

This goes on for a few mins where both me and her are arguing , i had to face upwards to talk to her. She starts pointing out that i have a semi erection and does a playful pull on my shaft "see, you didnt come here just for massage" 

More time is wasted with me trying to convince her to just give me a massage and we'll do extras towards the end if im interested. 10 mins have passed already and most of it was spent arguing. So i tell her i want to cancel and want a refund. She says OK and goes to talk to her boss or whoever. 
She comes back and says I can get $75 back because I spent some time already on the booking. I tell her no , i want a full refund. 

We go back and forth for another 10 mins and they settle and give me $80 back, when I paid $90. I didn't want to waste any more time so I just left

Avoid this place like the plague. 

Just out of interest the extras offered were

$60 for Hand relief
$100 for topless
$140 for nude

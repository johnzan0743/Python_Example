My experience/comments : After skipping on another local massage place, I saw this one and thought I would again take one for the team.  Walked in, and initial reactions were positive.
Typical AM setup, and I was thinking this will be good.  Paid $50 for 40mins (only time I had).  They had been quite - I was the 5 massage for the whole day, and I walked in at about 7.10pm.  Was told I would need to wait for 5 mins.  ok.
Shown to room, but told to leave jocks on - oh oh.  not good.  Shortly after, in walked the female version of Hulk Hogan!  Jee wiz no, and I am looking for my rosary beads!  She asked me if I needed an area looked after, and I am thinking to myself that if I let her anywhere near mini me she would rip him straight off!  I tell her lower back issues.

She starts working away, or should I say jack hammering away.  She especially liked using the point of her elbow right on the spine to the point I told her enough is enough and that the point of a massage is in part to relax, not send me to hospital.  She says, and I quote, "Sometimes no pain, no gain you know".  At this point, I tell her no thanks and ask her to clean the oil off so I can leave.

Gents - stay away from this one.

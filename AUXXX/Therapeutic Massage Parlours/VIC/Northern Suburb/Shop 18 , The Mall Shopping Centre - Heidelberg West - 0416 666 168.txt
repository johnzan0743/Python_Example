My experience/comments : 

so had some free time up my sleeve the other day and decided to give the Phoenix massage place a hit.
parked the car and walked in - nice clean place and greeted by a western guy.  asked him how much for a 1hr, and he says $70 - i was like your sign says $1/min... he goes they recently up'd the price. wasnt going to complain over $10. so i said i will take the 1hr.
he goes all the girls are busy, you will need to come back in 40mins... time i didnt have. 
so i figured Heidelberg wasnt too far (and slightly closer that Ivy massage) - jumped in the car and off to bell st. parked and jumped online to see the reviews. went into Bella massage, and greeted by Cody? who was a milfy looking viet woman with cleavage out. i asked for coco? and she said she is on holiday till May. but she would be able to give me a good massage if i came back in 15mins as the rooms were all taken. so, no luck again! went around the corner and found the other phoenix shop. went in and same deal $70 for 60mins. my time was running out so i accepted a 1hr from 'Just a Random' girl. (no reviews so had no names to ask for).

ended up with Tina, who was nice enuf and gave a good massage. she used to work 5 days but now only works on 1 day a week.
some sensual teasing on the ass and legs, then some more on the flip. $30 for the HJ (as she kept the change from the $100) i gave her.
a nice slow HJ with some leg and ass grabbing. shot my load, showered and went home.

$100 - not the best VFM but also not the worst. prob wont be back, as there is better value around the corner and also at IVY.

just a note to the Mod's - there are 2 shops under the same name. the other is in bundoora (unit 44/1191 plenty rd) 0420 207 878

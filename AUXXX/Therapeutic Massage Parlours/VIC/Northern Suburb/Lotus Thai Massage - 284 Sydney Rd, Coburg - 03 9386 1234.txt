My experience/comments :  Was really in need of a massage and thought I'd drop in here.   Kiki  a young Thai student was available.  Went in second room stripped down and laid on floor. In comes Kiki a really firm hot girl, little boy nearly stood at attention on sight.   Off with the towel that drapped my butt (thinking this is looking promising) and into a hard firm and excellent professional massage.  Legs being pushed and pulled every which way and she jumping all over me while stretching me out.  Plently of brushing past the old fella and he responded in kind.  Time for the flip, mr bob at full mast.   She continued as if nothing had been noticed.  Again jumping all over me working the front, chatting all the way.  As the time was ticking down I was waiting for her to work the final not - but no, nothing on offer "we don't do that" and smiled.

WIR: Yes absolutely one of the best massages ever, even if it was a little frustrating in the end.

This place is dryer than Arizona.  They also run the Narai Thai Massage shop in Keilor Rd Niddrie - the staff swap between the shops.  100% legit.  On Sydney Rd there are some other massage places more toward Bell St that may be worth checking out.

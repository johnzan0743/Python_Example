My experience/comments : Visited this place quite some time ago, thought I would drop in for a check on what they were up to.

Dropped in without a booking, Linda was at the desk, took my $70 for a 1 hour massage a escorted me into the rabbit warren of rooms that is this place.  "clothes off and into basket, be back soon".  As I was lying on the table waiting for Linda to return I was thinking that this place would be a nightmare to get out of in the event of a fire - on that basis alone, I am not all that keen on returning.

Anyway, Linda returns and gives me a pretty standard oil massage for about 30 min on my back, a minor amount of reach through TT and a couple of crack grazes - absolutely vanilla and she is not particularly interested. Tried to strike up a conversation but no luck there.  We really didn't click unfortunately.

On the flip, Linda comes close and whispers she offers HJ for 50 or BBBJ for 100 - bit steep I thought but in the interests of research I opted for the HJ which was actually quite reasonable.  No way was I paying $100 for a BJ.  Clean up with tissues, a bit of a scalp massage and then wonders ...... I was offered a shower.  So, out into the maze of rooms clutching my clothing with a towel wrapped around my middle.  Nice clean shower .  Linda was waiting for me outside the shower and showed me out through a side way and back to reception.

Summary.  Nothing special.........but......... they do offer a shower .

WIR,  Not for Linda anyway, I will continue to search to something that suits me in this part of the world.  When I find it ...... I will probably let you know

Look, some ask for 100 for nude hj, getting a bbbj for that price seems tempting

Yeah, you are probably right brauninc - I am just used to Sydney prices.

Sorry Mods, this should have been put into the Northern Suburbs section - my bad.

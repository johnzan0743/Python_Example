My experience/comments : Recommended to this place by a friend.  The massages are great.  Remind me to get new friends as it seems that the definition of a great massage differs between him and I.

Anyhow, I made a booking and went, but immediately knew no extras on offer when asked to fill in health form and pay beforehand.  Could you private health insurance card for roughly half off, so that was the only upside.

Shown to room with futon on floor - not bad, but as I was laying there with a towel over my arse, I felt a little cold.  Girl comes in and discreetly changes the towel for a full sheet.  Never asked to flip, and so never really got a good look at here.  No flip, no question of extras.  Massage only Gents.  Sorry.

My experience/comments : I went there as I wanted to try something new.  When I walked in, it reminded me of the massage shops you see in shopping centres with the curtain partions etc. 

An older lady greeted me and asked what I wanted.  As I wasn't getting the right signals, I opted for a 30min back and shoulder.  I was shown to a cubicle and I proceed to strip and get ready.

In walks a BLOKE, a first for me, and so all hopes of a HE have gone, and resign myself to a simple massage.

His massage technique was very good, and my lower back, while in a little pain before and during the session, has never been so good since.

While I was getting my massage, 2 other gents walked in.  One got a cute little Asian lady, while the other got the older lady.  There was curtains between the massage areas, but sound does travel, so I do not think any special massages will be available here.

I would recommend for a simple massage if that's what you are after.

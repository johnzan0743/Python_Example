Person's Name : Rose

Establishment : Massage shop with a name I don't recall

Date of Visit : April 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 14 Waterfield Street. Coburg
Phone : Unknown

Hours of Business : Unknown

Rates : $40/30 mins + extras

Age : 40s at least

Size/shape : Not to shabby for someone of her vintage

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Massage HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes / yes

My experience/comments : 

Was in the area with some time to kill, saw this place, went in, met Rose, said, no thanks, checked out a couple of other places which were nearby, and came back. Got a good massage from Rose and then a serviceable HJ for +$20 with under clothes feeling (no bra which is always a big turn on for me).

Great VfM, I'd return (and next time get more info such as phone number and name).

I saw a review in bronze from a couple of years ago; not sure if Ross is Rose, but FS definitely not on the menu.

Please confirm the address - I could not find it on Google Maps.

There is a review in Bronze for 14 Waterfield Street - is this the same place?

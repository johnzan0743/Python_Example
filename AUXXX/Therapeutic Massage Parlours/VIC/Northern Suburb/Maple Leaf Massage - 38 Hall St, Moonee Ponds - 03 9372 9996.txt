My experience/comments : 
Was always curious about this place so went it for the team. There was 1 aussie girl and she is asking if I want relaxation? Sure. Went in, I stripped off to my undies and she immediately gave me the towel to cover up. There goes my assumptions  .

Nice massage though (for relaxation, not hard). A couple of conversation confirms that she doesn't provide other extras.

Does this have anything to do with the Maple Leaf massage in Heatherton?

From the look of About Me - Maple Leaf Massage, the Heatherton operation is a solo operation whereas the other is a franchise or a bigger business.

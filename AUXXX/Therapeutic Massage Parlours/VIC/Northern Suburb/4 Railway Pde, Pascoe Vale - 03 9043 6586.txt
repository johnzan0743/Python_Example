Age :   last twenties

Size/shape :   12 curvy

Value for money/recommend? :   maybe..

My experience/comments : Saw the ad in the paper and i was visiting a mates house in the area i thought why not drop in on my way home. Easy to find opposite basically opposite the railway station right near a cafe so not discreet at all. From the outside looks like a dodgy Asian ran business and inside is a bit the same was taken into a private room where i saw tissues as well as oil and thought jackpot. Anna was a polish girl whos ok looking but was complaining to me about her bf breaking up with her and that she partied too late last night. Howver she gave a really good massage working out a few kinks in my back and neck but with no signs of tackle tickle at all. Was then asked to turn over and no towel placed over me so thought this mayb a winner...
She then continued to give a proper massgae of the thighs and stomach working her way around lil tbone but never touching or going close at all... she then moved onto my arms until i asked for  the tug. She said she could but it would cost more an extra 20 bucks i bargained for 30 with topless to which she was happy with it. It was not the best hj but not the worst but def something i needed at the time..WIR probably as the massage was fairly good and the tug not bad so overall worth it. I'd love to know a place where the massage great and the tug is as well..any ideas?

I went there last year after seeing an ad for an Indian masseuse on Gumtree I think and it was an odd setup.There were 3 girls working from 2 rooms,one of which also doubled as the waiting room,with only a curtain separating the massage table from the waiting chairs.There didn't seem to be a manager and I got the impression that the girls all did their own thing.There was an Aussie girl using that room and the other room was used by either the Indian girl or an Asian lady who had her own business cards.I made an appointment with the Indian girl (Nisha?) the night before and turned up at the appointed time and ended up waiting about half an hour in the front room while some other bloke was getting a massage from the Aussie girl about 4 feet away from me.When it became apparent that the Indian girl wasn't going to show I was offered a massage in the other room by the Asian lady which was good but completely uneventful.As I was leaving I was cheerfully introduced to Nisha who had managed to turn up by then and she didn't even acknowledge my booking or apologise for not showing.The whole place seemed like an absolute shambles with nothing on offer except frustration and I vowed to never return.

On my quest to find an establishment that offered anything BUT Asian flavor I found this joint. Walked in for a half hour appointment and got to see the lovely Sonya. The place when you walk in looks like (close to) a legit massage establishment which I like. Was asked a couple of question then lead to a room and had the pleasure of spending the last 10 minutes with Sonya topless who revealed a pair of very nice B/C cups to finish the job. For returning visitors I think there would a different sequence of events and possibly more on offer she seemed to spend a bit of time talking in the beginning to work out my expectations I think.

Price- $50 + $50 finish (I don't haggle - yes I know everyone here will be mad at me)
Nationality- Indian
Age- early 20's
Looks 8/10
Body 7/10
Massage 7/10

Works M.W.T.F

There are no less than 4 massage venues virtually next to each other. The experienced fellow will know which one to choose....

Date 2/4/12 (evening)

Dropped back into see what else was on offer and met with a Germany lass named Paula who offered a a very different experience from my last visit. Paula entered the room as I was getting undressed and as I lay on the table threw the "courtesy towel" over me - it was a little cold so I'm thinking okay maybe she's just looking out for my welfare.... Massage was pretty sub-standard and pretty soft, she used so much oil I was starting to feel like a McDonalds french fry. with 15 minutes left the roll over came and so did the towel again! time slipped away and before I knew it she says "that's it, lay there and I'll get a towel to wipe you over" AAARGH! WTF! In short I got a pretty crappy massage and that's it... Looks like this place is hit and miss.

On the basis of 97anoid's earlier review and against my better judgement I made a second visit to this place as I was in the area.Since my terrible visit last year the place has totally changed with extensive internal remodelling.Looking from the street you see what appear to be 2 separate massage businesses next to each other but upon entering you find out that they are both connected internally so it doesn't matter which door you go in,you end up in the same place.One shopfront looks more professional than the other but inside it's all the same.I was greeted by a guy,which is never a good sign,paid $50 for a half hour massage and was then shown to a room which had both tissues and a lock on the door,which I found encouraging.He then told me to get undressed and he would send in a masseuse.I lay down and the massesuse came in and I then had a half hour massage with no conversation at all and no hint of any extras.There was not even a flip,all she saw was my back and the only time I saw her was on the way out.The only positive was that the massage was not too bad but I could have got the same thing in a shopping centre for less money or an hour for the same price at Holiday Calm.I will never return.

Toomuchtime - your review makes me sad. 

I was hoping that my review was just the result of getting a bad masseuse or catching a good one on a bad day but it seems this is not the case.

This place is a joke.  I have been several times and not one time was worth remembering for a good reason.  One time they didn't have any change and the masseuse wrote a note for me to go back and collect my cash a few days later.  Take your hard earned to 439 Plenty Rd which is not far away.

Same thing for me, on the basis of earlier reviews I made a visit to this place as I was in the area. I was greeted by a guy, which was a bit of a worry straight away, paid $50 for a half hour massage and was then shown to a room, saw boxes of tissues and thought I could be in luck. He then told me to get undressed, put all my clothes and belongings in a box next to the massage table and he would send in a masseuse. AS she came in, I asked her what her name was, as soon as she she Paula, I was like SHIT as per previuos posts. There was no flip or anything, just plain massage which wasnt even that good! Not as much oil as per 97anoids post! Definitely aint going back, il just drive or train it down to Ascot vale!

By excellent do you want to elaborate?
This is a forum I think and one the disseminates and shares info. Or are we just a lurkers haven?
If you got a tug say so, if you didn't say so.
The info steam here is sometimes so vague as to be rendered entirely useless.
Like many of us in Victoria we are reluctant to share addresses etc because of our moronic laws. Losing a gem of venue is tragic but being the cause of that more tragic however posting without content is fucking stupid and treats us all like fuckwits.

$80 for 60mins + $30 for topless HJ
Lisa (Indonesian) mid 20s great tits decent body - great massage and awesome HJ, Big tits for an asian girl and doesn't mind some letting your hands explore in her pants either. Let me blow on her tits so i was happy. A bit pricey but i don't mind as its close and convenient for me.

$80 for 60mins + 30HJ
Min (Korean) - massage was ok, she talks A LOT and mostly about herself. On the turn she asked if i had been there before, i said yes i seen Lisa. She then asked if i received some extras and soon we were having some fun. Good steady tug, didn't go topless but i didnt bother asking.

50 - 30mins Massage
Alexandra (Aussie) early 20s - stopped by on thursday and was welcomed by Alexandra, blonde, slim and fantastic body. Very friendly girl but could only give me a 30min massage as she finished at 7pm and i had walked in at 7:10pm. Massage was great but there was no turn over, curious to go early next time and see if i have better luck. Anyone seen Alexandra and been lucky?

Decided to explore over to Northern region today, called 4 Railway Pde Pascoe Vale an strong accent Asian lady answered saying they are open, after getting lost trying to find the place from the Tulla there was a sign in front of the shop flashing "OPEN" which is near a Pub and train station, a young, strong looking and built Asian girl (looks that she could give Kim Jong-il a slap or 2) answered the door. After a quick pleasantry I am shown to a clean low light room with a proper massage table with adjustable head/fac support which was a first!
After taking my cash $50.00 for 30mins she tells me to strip and will return soon.... upon her return her name is Min and she is from Korea, aged 24.  She has a good technique and enjoys a conversation, I think she is also studying English at Tafe/Uni cause she enjoys talking, however I didnt mind.

after 25mins into the massage I asked if she offered extras, to my surprise she bluntly replied "NO" only topless hand relief....(but didnt hear the extra $$$$$). Min asked i I wanted a topless show and was ok for me to touch which I thought it was the go, I quickly said OK...... but said again it will be $30 for HJ and extra $50 for a topless HJ, I decided on the cheaper of the 2 evils which is still a bit rich ! she told me to flip over and Min started on a very light touching, somewhat tickling across the mid regions.... with a couple a intentional brushes of the hands I reacted to her touches then she started a slow oiled tug......with her other hand massaging my sack and above the sphincter. Her massage was slow and controlled which was relaxing with no rush then slowly built up to a strong, (I did say she is built) fast tug..... after a good 5mins I finally let go and it was like an analogy of Mt Krakatoa erupting!!! Min cleaned up the jizz and I noticed that she replaced with a clean towel. I got dressed and escorted out another door.

The room was a good size with a couple of massage toys on a spare chair, the massage table is electric with adjustable pivots which is a first ! Min is a nice girl, however may talk a little too much but will push for extra $$$$$ her massage is very good and HJ also as good but if you want to depart with over $100 from your sky rocket I suggest to stay with the clothes on RnT.

Enjoy the North

My experience/comments : 

Popped into this one having seen a Gumtree add.

Was welcomed by a tallish good looking Korean girl.

All the usual signs were there, tissues, oil etc. 

I made myself comfortable, she came in and took my boxers off saying I don't need them on, no towel was put on to cover me up. She asked if I knew where she was from and I said Korea first try and she was very impressed that I could pick her nationality.

Massage was hard and thorough, she was very chatty and flirtatious...with her words and hands.

On the flip she seen my boner and asked if I want, I obliged and at $60 was allowed to feel her rather large tits whilst she gave an expert HJ....I lasted longer than usual which she didn't seem to mind.

Blew my load and she giggled, cleaned me up and sent me on my way.

Best massage in ages. $50 up front, $60 for topless HJ touching allowed.

Services Provided : Massage / R&T

Value for money/recommend? : No. Expensive, not good looking women.

My experience/comments : 

Partner in crime booked us both in to try this place we'd been wanting to try... suspected there was more than the legitimate ads suggested. We were right.

By the time i'd finished work and got there, my mate was already in a session. I was greeted by Soni, who asked if i was there for an appointment, she told me my friend was already inside and took my $50 and sent me to the room. i took of my clothes and put them in the "box" as requested. I left my underwear on as a bit of a test. When Soni returned she asked if i'd like to remove them. Good sign.

I removed them and lay down for a rather satisfying massage. The brushes got more obvious, and before long she asked me to flip and subsequently whether i'd like any extras. I asked what was on offer and she said HJ for $25. I enquired if topless was avaiable (clothed i don't think i would have made it). $50 was the price but before long it was $40. Off she went. She has massive tits. Even then i was struggling to get hard let alone blow off some steam... Sure enough as i think her hand was about to fall off it was all over.

Towels weren't warm which sucked a bit.

Probably wont return. My friend saw another short chubby girl (maybe Mona?).. apparently massage was horrible but the HJ was ok.. he didnt think to request topless, still cost him an extra $50.

Age : 24-27

Size/shape : 8   with amazing D cup breasts     

Nationality or Ethnicity : Korean

Services Provided : Massage  and Body to Body nude erotic massage and HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yeah I thought so as was an amazing massage and erotic experience with amazing girl

My experience/comments : 
Well I rang and booked this based on the hot pics of girl in photo, rocked up and was met by Christine- korean  very hot  probably 9/10
Tall girl , long legs up to her naval and a great set of tits  D cup
Attractive and hot

Usual questions at start,  asked for how long  stated 1 hour, she went off while I got undressed and lay on table, she  came back in and proceeded to start nice massage with some oil  ( little bit)  she asked if I want hard or soft, I say Hard,  I wouldn't say it was hard but was certainly very enjoyable,   she spoke reasonably well and her hands were doing a fantastic job

probably  after about 20 -30 minutes into 1 hour massage which was very sensual she asked if I wanted special massage, I say of course and so she then fusses around and I hear her taking off her clothes while she drips oils on me and proceeds with an extremely sensual and soft finger rubbing all over body and then I feel her tits and body rubbing and sliding all over me gently and erotically,  absolutely amazing  bit like a tantric massage that those girls do in Fitzroy.

The she hops up onto table and slides her body all over me   OMG this was sensual and erotic, I was in bliss

Eventually I get to roll over and she proceeds to do same to me on my front, rubbing herself all over me and cat bathing  me a little bit as well.
Then she proceeded to use her tits to tease my cock and her hands to slowly caress it and guide it where she wanted to,   also body sliding up my entire body and rubbing my cock with her body and clit but not letting anything else occur of course,  OMG  so erotic I was in heaven.
Naturally this is only a brief description of the encounter and she eventually got me over the line wanting me to cum on her tits while giving me a HJ

Now I didn't ask for more given it was first time and I was having so much fund and I was in bliss I didn't care,  definitely YMMV .

expensive - Yes   but I was still happy

Sounds like a great (and expensive) punt. 
Was she up front with her charges/rates?
Or did u tip her? 

Just for that price could have gotten 2 decent punts for 45mins each service with a BBBJ included... 

But I know how u feel, sometimes it's good to throw some cash around and as long as the service & quality is good then it was worth it!

Went and saw Julia the other day. Cute lil asian looking thing with a smoken bod(didn't see it naked though.) $50 for 30 min massage with $50 for a happy ending. Way too expensive even if her handjob was pretty good. She told me she does Naked body slides for $150. Real expensive but she was good looking and i wouldn't mind having her naked titts rubbing all over me aslong as i can finish all over them. But yeah the $220 price tag is off putting.

JustaRandom  she told me her rates for massage up front, it was not until she was probably half way through the back massage that she asked if I would like her special massage as she felt comfortable offering it to me and knew I would love it, she then stated the additional cost of $170, well I was so into it of course I said yes as I wanted to see her nude anyway.  Thats when as she was massaging me she was taking off her clothes and was eventually nude and then using her whole body on me, OMG   sorry I need to go and take a cold shower!!

Saw Mona a young Irish girl. Had to be no older then 18/19. Great at teasing and good hj. Has piggies as breasts as well but didn't allow sucking which is a shame. Her rates were $50hj $60 topless hj $100 nude hj and $150 body slides. Wanted the body slides but for a total of $200 I could get 2 fs services elsewhere so dictje $60 option.

My experience/comments :

Getting a lil tired of the asain scence and in the mood for something different i went to a place that advertises on (L) and is in the northern suburbs near a train station.

Walking in  you are asked to right your details down and a form and agree that you understand you won't be getting a sexual service and will be asked to leave i you do. Obviously this is just to look legit. Also does anyone put down there real details?

Anyways i get Mona as my massage girl who looks no older then 18. Cute face with that girl next door look.
I ask for a sensual massage as i had a rough day at work and just wanted to unwind. Jumped on the table in the birthday suite and no attempt to cover me up at all.  signs looking good.

Anyways we have a good chat while she massages me and there is alot of teasing. Just before the flip there is plenty of ball play. Good i love it when the girls do this while your on your stomach. LOVE IT LOL.

Anyways i flip over and she asks for extras. $40 tug, $60 topless tug $100 nude tug, $150 body slides (Not available as you have to choose at the start and we didn't have much time).

Pretty expensive and although she seemed pretty small in the chest area i went the $60 option. She took her top off to reveal a nice pair of B cups. felt great in my hand and what i loved about them is that she has Puffie nipples. OMG i love them. Only downer is that i wasn't allowed to suck  

Anyways her handjob was good with lots of teasing on the shaft till she gave it a good grip and pumped away with a good rythem until i exploded all over her arm. 

Will i return, I want to as i would love to have her naked body slide all over me but the cost is abit off putting.

Bloody hell Johnnydtf, those prices are outrageous !!! $50 will get you a nude tug with touching and sucking in many shops. Maybe this is the price we pay for wanting Caucasian services. But, to each his own.

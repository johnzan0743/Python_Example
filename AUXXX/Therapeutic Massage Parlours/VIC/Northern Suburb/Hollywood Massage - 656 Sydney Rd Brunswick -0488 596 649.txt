Hi Everyone,

I have a big favour to ask the members.  A good friend of mine has done what some of us would love to do, and invested in a Massage parlour.

It is reasonably new (3 months).  I would appreciate some feedback on the shop and how to improve (not mentioning the website to them).  I will simply tell him 'that a friend of mine went, and this is what he said' type thing.

It is in busy Sydney Rd. I suggested that he find somewhere else less saturated with Massage shops. However he didn't listen to me on that one.  Open from 10am - 10pm.

At the moment he has 2 girls, Lyly and Thuy.  Young (20's - 30's) girls.  Both will do at least HJ so he tells me.  One of the girls knows that I know the owner, and therefore might be hard for me at the moment to get a unbiased review.

So, I am asking what you guys think would be some ways to improve the shop - something like mystery shoppers I guess.  I will get something going, such as a loyalty based scheme (5th massage free etc).  Other ideas to grow business????

I get the feeling he needs to make this work, so your help and feedback is always appreciated.

Regards

AT

Hi Punt,

Agreed - don't know the theory on this one, but not my decision.  However some might like the idea of doing a little punting under the nose of the local, and very close, constabulary!

Well I will certainly give the place a try when I am in the area.  The plods don't worry me....I think they have far more pressing issues to worry about anyway these days!

I paid a visit to this shop 4-5 weeks ago AT but did not post a review as I had a bit going on and by the time I got back to it had forgotten the detail and don't like to post half arse reviews. What I do remember was the mid 20's Viet girl (not Thai ?) was tall, slim and pretty sexy but was not keen on extras beyond a  clothed HJ. Extras pretty expensive too. Massage was ok and girl friendly enough. Shop clean & fresh. In summary an ok experience but nothing special enough to make me want to rush back. With so much competition you need a bit of X factor  to get the return business from punters IMO. Not sure Hollywood has it....

Person's Name : Lily

Establishment : Hollywood Massage

Date of Visit : Dec 2018

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : As above

Phone : As above

Hours of Business : Unknown

Rates : $50/30; $60/45; $70/60 plus extras

Age : 20s or early 30s

Size/shape : Tall, slim. Great set of legs and arse. Not massively pretty.

Nationality or Ethnicity : Viet

Services Provided : "Massage", nude HJ, some anal play 

Value for money/recommend? : No

My experience/comments : 

After I found a nearby favourite of mine was shut for the holiday period, I was driving down Sydney Road when I found this place. Last punt for the year, so make it a new one!

I enter the shop to find a slim, reasonably attractive girl mid-mouthful eating some food. She giggles, I laugh, things get off to a good start. I ask for 30 minutes, then up it to 45. I pay her the $60, she gets up to show me to the room and there are these legs that go on. And on. And on. And end in these really skimpy shorts. I'm there.

Get shown into the room, and, unusually, Lily stays with me while I get undressed. She gets the table ready, and I lie down on it. The massage is wafty at best, but Lily has a good command of English, and is a nice person to talk to. An experimental feel of her legs has her giggling, "it tickles!", and when she starts massaging my bum, I move my hand up to feel her  arse, and she says, "what are you doing?" 

"Well, you're feeling my arse, it seems unfair," I reply. Another response with that wonderful laugh.

By this stage, all pretence of a massage has disappeared. She asks me to flip, I do, and she asks if anything else needs attention. The prices for extras are over the top ($50 for clothed HJ, going up in increments of $50 for removal of various bits of clothing), so those negotiations go no further.

Lily is a good sort, but her massage is poor and extras are insanely priced. Would I pay $150 for a nude Keisha Grey to give me a HJ? Probably. Lily? No.

It's a real shame, because Lily is a top bird, and has a real spark about her. It's the one thing most MLs lack. For me, I look for at least two of the following three things in order to get me to return: (1) that spark; (2) a decent massage; (3) reasonably priced extras. Lily has (1), but not the other two.

Dean.

What would get me to try this place would be a Groupon deal - gives it an air of legitimacy, helps us cut costs & I can earn frequent flyer points!

Not to mention having a purely tug shop next to Mr Plod probably isn't smart, so it would help to get leisure legitimate foot traffic in there.

That's good to know but if it's going to cost $150 for a nude HJ as Dean reported then it ain't worth the trip there...

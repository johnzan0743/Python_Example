I've always noticed this place each time I ventured to "Pens", so I decided it was time to crack it.
It's a -HUGE- place on the second floor of a big corner building. Inviting yellow signs lure you upstairs where there's a small reception.
They offer two options, oil massage and aroma oil massage (and asking for the second one it's usually the 'code' to get extras in some venues...) but NO, not here, they'll just use more expensive essential oils rather than the normal one.
This place is FANCY, the corridor has nice features and even rocks and pebbles on the floor F-F-S! I found myself jumping from one tile to another like a ninja or something.

On my first visit I didn't receive any offer nor the sign that anything extra was available. I kept going back every now and then, to see if I had any luck, but so far nothing.
I've been there three times now and tried three different girls: Nancy, Stella and Buy (Ah, BUY! Her name reminded me of the Buy who used to work at emBody, 'Oconnel St Nth Melbourne, she had fantastic hands, almost like Nina's!).
To be honest the massage has always been above par without being excellent, I'd say between 7.5/10 and 8.5/10, but nothing else ever happened.

Has anybody else tried this place?

Yes, I've been there a number of times over the last 3 years or so.

Seems to be absolutely legit (oftentimes an EFTPOS machine is a dead giveaway).

Like giveng I've had above average massages, most times from above average looking girls. Some are willing to massage without the towel, some are willing for you to have a wank while they work (and some aren't and it's important IMHO to respect that)

Used to go there a year or two back
Saw Honey then
She was always in for HJ
It depends on the girl, but most were fairly limited then

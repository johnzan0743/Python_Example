My experience/comments : 

Was in the area on a couple of errands. Driving along a back street in Greensborough and saw this place. Had some time, so thought why not. Went in to a well-appointed shop and a pleasant enough lady came out to take my booking, who also gave me the massage. I asked for a soft massage, and got an oily light massage, which was good enough. Come the flip, the question was asked, she wanted $50, I offered $20, for $30 we had a done deal. Phenomenal HJ, one of the best I've had, along with some really saucy dirty talk, which came completely out of the blue.

Pros: friendly girl, plenty of parking, base price $45/30 not too bad, massage reasonable, HJ great, excellent dirty talk.
Cons: Extras pricy but negotiable, Engrish not great.

Ivy works M, Tu, Th, F, and weekends at a shop in the CBD. Couldn't figure out which one. I'm rarely in the area, but would make sure if I was it wasn't on a Wednesday and try and build in time for a return visit.

Hours of Business : 10-10

Rates : $80 for 45 mins

Age : 21

Size/shape : 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Australian really nice and hot

Services Provided : massage only

Value for money/recommend? : not sure
Found there ad on locanto and spoke with them over the phone to make a booking. SHe gave enough hints on the phone to make me think there was more on offer.
Arrived at the place to find a really nice venue and the american lady who was running told me she wont be doing my massage today and that simone will be.
Place has a rear entrance so makes me think there is more on offer. Hand over 100 and she says she will give change later if needed..
Hop up on the table naked and spot a box of tissues and think im luck. no towel or covering done of any sort
Start talking with simone and she is very friendly and chatty and actually quite a good masseuse.
She does the back half of the massage and runs her hand all over my body but no touching of the balls and asks if we doing the front side?
I say yes so the flip happens and no towel is placed to cover anything She continues to massage around my dick and accidentally bumps it once or twice but at the end just says times almost up. Its at this point i ask for extras and she says she doesn't do that.

SO she finishes the massage and does not wipe the oil off of me saying there is a towel in the room to do that and doesn't offer me a shower at all.
So i leave to go back to work covered in oil. Its at this point i realize i haven't got my change and go to ask the american girl for it.
She actually says but didn't she and then stopped herself....Not sure if this is a ploy to get me back again and i just lucked out with the girl who doesn't do extras or a great act to suck more money out of me. All in all got a good massage but left with blue balls...
Has anyone been here and able to get some extras? would love to know if its worth it to keep trying

The American girl,Elle,is the manager and also the mistress of one of the owners.He allows her to live on the premises but does not pay her so her only income comes from offering extras to some clients.I have been told that if she finds out other girls are offering extras she sacks them.
At $100 an hour and no guarantee of landing anything,it would be an expensive fishing expedition...

My experience/comments : Elle is very sexy, with blond hair and a really tight toned body. She has very good lomi experience and gives a beautiful lomi with lots of oil with underneath strokes, under your legs and stomach. She is reluctant to offer more until she knows you or is comfortable with you, but when she is, for a $50 tip you will receive a very sensual HJ on top of a great massage.
Highly recommend.

Person's Name : Sophie

Establishment : Lomi Massage

Date of Visit : December 24th 2015, XMAS Eve  

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_4...nee-Ponds.html 3-4 minute walk from train station.

Hours of Business : 10am-10pm 7 days a week

Rates : $80 for 45 mins $100 for 1 hour.

Age : 28

Size/shape : Size 8 Big B cups (softish)

Nationality or Ethnicity : Turkish with a big of greek.

Services Provided : Massage, Hand relief and Exchange Massage.

Value for money/recommend? : Butterflies in my stomach, oh hell yessss!

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Easier to get to this place than I thought. A bit pricier by about 30% more than my usual joint but same regular therapist, money is no issue. Rocked up about 20 minutes early, Sophie is fine with that, we stayed in reception area to chat for about 10-15 minutes then we went in to a large room.

Everything you ever need for massage and what not is in the room already including towels and hand basin. A very nice touch. I always know what to expect from Sophie and vice-versa.

4 minutes later she returned to the room and the conversation started, general stuff whilst she was massaging my back and my shoulders and neck with softish massage, which she knows I like the most. then massage the legs and I raised my groin up enough for her to begin the teasing early on. From memory I hadn't blown my load since yesterday but I always quickly have enough in resupply over night, and before yesterday, it was a couple days my previous home wank. SO I knew I was going to blow the top off the volcano.

More teasing along aswell with the other hand massaging my lower back, my bum and my upper legs including the inner of both legs. She knows how to get me so horny and to make me content.

I promised her a bit of a massage also, I booked her for 45 mins but previously she priomised me 50 mins as I'm her most regular client and she had a bit of time spare before the next client after me. I like that extra touch when Therapists extend main clients time at not disadvantage of either of us nor the next customer. Very nice.

But with 30 mins to go I had to turn over as I wanted the little (ok not so little) to explode and then the massage her, wanted to give her a massage for 10-15 minutes and end with a few minutes of just cuddling. Cuddling is my favourite thing with Sophie at the end of the session as it makes her not as tired from so many massages during the day and means she is better with the next client also. Well she lubed up my man and her hands and started the tug whilst playing with my pierced nipples and also rubbing my tummy, my chest and cupping and pulling down on my large balls. SOmething I previously told her I enjoy and gets me harder a lot quicker.

That is another thing I like about her, she remembers those small things that I enjoy with her during our bookings. She is so caring as a therapist and person. Give or take 10 minutes I blew all over the shop and let out a little sigh at the end when I blew, she smiled at me and enjoyed the show. She cleaned the area and I cleaned my hands with baby wipes and hand lotion over at the hand basin, now my turn to massage her as she placed down a towel on the table after wiping the bench/table down.

She closed her eyes as I massaged her shoulders, stomach, arms and breasts. Her cave is so sensitive these days from waxing so for today I couldn't go near there. I hope to go near there during our next booking where I said I would give her more of a longer massage as my booking time next time is 1 hour. I also blew in her ear, kissed her nose, a cheek and her forehead and on 1 of her back f her hands. 5 minutes left and I climbed back on the table and we cuddles and just talked about things generally in life.

Each booking just feels more better and more complete and makes me more and more happy, if that is at all possible.

Sophie from what I know and been told by herself, works in Moonee Ponds on Mondays and Tuesdays. In Hawthorn on Sundays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

She will however be on holiday from December 31st to gold coast and return to melbourne on Sunday 3rd January but working up till and including Wednesday 30th December then I am guessing again from January 4th.

WIR - Yes I am. To both shops, taking in turns Hawthorn on a Sunday and Moonee Ponds 8 days later on the Monday. Sophie is most definitely worth the time and effort to get to know better.

The more regular you book her, the more awesome she is, she is already awesome anyway.

If I was anyone in Melbourne and you don't mind travelling out to Hawthorn or Moonee Ponds (Close to train stations and Tram stops) then Sophie is most certainly worth booking. But to experience how awesome she is, 45 minutes or 1 hour is advised. Sophie is also a Gym person 

Over my time punting, Sophie is most definitely heads and shoulders easily my favourite by the length of the Flemington Racecourse straight.

Person's Name : Nora

Establishment : Lomi Massage

Date of Visit : January 2016

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_4...h-Massage.html

Hours of Business : Monday-Saturday 11am-9pm (i think!)

Rates : $80 for 45 minutes ($100 for 60 mins)

Age : 28

Size/shape : size 8

Nationality or Ethnicity : Turkish (part Greek)

Services Provided : Sensual Massage + clothed Hand relief $40 for H.R

Value for money/recommend? : ALLLLWWWAAAAYYYYSSSSS

My experience/comments : (Please put some effort  into this part for all of our readers, a minimum requirement of 25 words  or more to get a picture of time spent and experience had.)

Was in bad mood today so thought I would enquire with my regular about coming in to other shop today, we finally agreed 45 minutes for $80. Extras were very quietly negotiated in the room when I was there. After her gym workout yesterday, Nora was looking even more stunning from when I last saw her last Sunday in Hawthorn. She really is a beautiful looking lady. Very impressive. Big B cup breasts, I never noticed before but her lips are the best i've seen.

General chitter chatter about how we both were and about world events and how things are going with her best friend Amy (who i've also had 6-7 times in the past and will again 23rd January for a 1 off). Massage was as lovely as ever, nice long strokes and a lovely leg massage, didn't raise my groin as I was too in to out chat at the time. Mind you 45 minutes felt like it went for an hour.

Nice smooth soft-medium massage on my legs and my back and great massage on my shoulders and neck. Nora really know how to give a very very good massage (Sensual). SHe is well trained in massaging. Absolutely top notch. She doesn't leave any part of your body untouched. We once again listened to her turkish music on her mobile, the more i listen to her taste of music, the more I like.

Eventually it was time to turn over. I was allowed to touch her all over outside her clothes as I only paid $40 for extras, a hand relief was promised but clothes stayed on, that is fine. Got to play with her lovely b cups for a bit but concentrated on her slimmer tighter stomach (she likes the gym and goes twice aweek atleast and it is beginning to show) and her bum is just the best to massage also. Love her bum. And she knows it, with cheeky grins whilst I was playing with it.

Anyway, she started to lube up my gold member and her smooth yet sexy hands. She began a great hand job whilst also massaging my stomach, chest and playing with my large pierced nipples. Ever since they were pierced it has always turned me on when Nora plays with them and it wasn't long until I was rock hard, we both grinned at each other.

I deliberately had a few wanks yesterday to prolong my explosion today. A good foot massage earlier I forgot to mention also. She is also the best I've ever had for a foot massage.

About 8-10 minutes later the explosion was something to behold. Very impressive even if I do say so myself, Nora was impressed also. She cleaned me up with a couple of towels and the last few minutes we just chatted about general stuff. Not enough time for a cuddle, oh well, next time in Hawthorn along with the exchange massage. I owe her a massage.

I would recommend Nora in a heart beat, very thorough in her massages and doesn't miss any part of your body and more than happy to make you feel a lot happier by the end of the booking than when you came in to the shop. No doubt the best Massage Therapist I have ever had and will ever have.

Nora works in this shop in Moonee Ponds on Mondays and Fridays. But you will have to txt shop for her hours on those days.

What do you get when you mix ...

 AND 

... A pretty good Lomi Lomi Massage with a professional massage therapist.

First booking with the main therapist at this shop that I've been to a couple times previously.


Didn't know what to expect, I was like brauninc with Emily the first time in some time, nervous and hoping all was ok. And it was, more than ok. Me and THE BODY got on ok to good. She is ok for a conversation or 2 during the session. Give a professional Lomi Lomi massage. Doesn't allow touching which I respect. More of that later.


Stayed fully clothed due to that also. This was just a stop fill massage until I move on to bigger and better things this coming Friday.


Beautiful massage over the neck, shoulders, back and legs and also the bum. A spot on lomi lomi massage which included strokes under the body and the very odd time of slight very slight touching of the gold balls and the 1 wood.


Was only a 45 minute massage which I paid $80 (60 mins is $100).


It was about 25 minutes in to the session time for the flip. The main part of the lomi was the back work when on my stomach. Never had a lomi massage before, It was ok I must admit.


A couple minutes after turning over she asked if I wanted work on THIS area, the freshly shaved groin area, I said oh yes please. This lovely lady gives a very good hand relief with minimal eye contact (only bad point bout it). And good to very good ball work which would push Brett Favre to his limits on the football field.


Even though it was a 45 minute session, I also held her hand whilst she was doing the deed. And we lost track of time and instead of 45 minutes, it went to 52 minutes probably cos I am a semi-regular there and promise I would be a regular there as long as a certain therapist was there. I JUST got over the line with 2 days supply in the bank.


I was still half hard when she went to check to see if her replacement worker came in (she has a sore left shoulder blade). Whilst she was gone for the 2 minutes, I was still pretty horny so I played with myself a bit, she returned and I was 3/4 hard, pretty sure she noticed. She passed me a towel and showed me to the shower.


I just had to go round 2, this time by myself in the shower, and the deed was done again, this time in the shower. I dried myself and got dressed.


Upon leaving the shop, she told me her usual customers only give her $40-$50 for tips/extras. Im used to paying $80-$100. Gave her $80 at the start of the session. Im ok with that. Just means with my next therapist (and until THE THERAPIST returns) I will just tip $80 instead $100.


I would recommend THE BODY if you want a legit lomi lomi massage with good conversations and a 7/10 hand relief. She is very pretty with eyes and a smile that would make any guy hard. But is a professional, no touching and keeps clothes on. So legit other than hand relief, a $40-$50 hand relief.


Would I re-book her? Yes I would if my Plan A & B aren't available. The more you book this lady, the further you progress as she advised me. Maybe booking 3 she will go nude for me.

Shooter McGavin says bang bang!



Well I rang up this shop yesterday early afternoon to organise a booking with the usual suspect for this friday to get told she left the shop and they wont be hiring her again. Not the first time this lady has done the same thing to a shop. She is certainly making a bad name for herself. The 2nd time she has screwed me around for a booking. So so close to blacklisting her and never booking her again (Another time, another day for that chat in a future created thread!!).

I was up for The Body round 2. She was the only 1 on Tuesday as not enough bookings for more than 1 worker.

Hot day outside, 35 degrees. The body was wearing gym gear and later found out a nice tight little g string under her gym short shorts which were pretty much painted on.

A relaxation massage this time with more action on the bat and multiple cricket balls.

Lovely long strokes all over the place and lovely discussions on all sorts of topics (Including her giving me future updates on future specific therapist(s), a nice touch if I do say so myself, she hasn't done me wrong yet, and I believe she wont, trust goes both ways). Time goes fast when you enjoy yourself with the nice ladies of the industry.

The Body is an intellect and prefers topics of the world and current news and the sort. Studying is her thing other than massage. My type of person. The more often you book, the further you get. Worth the interest. Like on the football field, more success the more you develop.

2nd booking with her and enjoyed myself a bit more. Enjoyable time.

This 2nd booking I was able to explore 'The Body' with my wandering hands. And what an exploration it was.

As I previously said, time went quick, 45 minute booking went to around 50 minutes, so that is the 2nd time in 2 bookings it has gone for 50+ minutes for a 45 minute booking, very nice touch. A fair bit or arse and boobs play and playing with her strong fit legs, a tiny bit on the muscular sidee in the hamstrings part of the legs. I got over the line quite easily this time. And The Body drained every bit of my love juice and even extended the hand relief to milk more and more.

A shower was used afterwards to quickly wash off the oil used during the session.

Going a bit left of center next booking, trying a 'curvy' pretty lady who offers more than the normal service.

With this booking yesterday (Tuesday), Shooter McGavin scored, and scored well. Bang Bang ...

By the way, the only cameras they have there are (maybe) in reception and out the front of the shop. I can confirm there are no cameras in the massage rooms. I can also confirm that the main therapist there Elle, doesn't mind if other girls there do extras. It is up to them. Only rule there is not to discuss clients with each other. Or so i'm told by her during a booking.

Person's Name : Tina

Establishment : Lomi Lomi Massage - Moonee Ponds

Date of Visit : March 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0404 577 952 / 22 Shuter St Moonee Ponds Vic / No web page that I can find, various FB and GT entries that come and go. 

Hours of Business : 11am to 9 pm 7 days

Rates : $100/hour plus tips

Age : early 20's

Size/shape : Slim 6-7 C cup - body to die for 

Nationality or Ethnicity : South African/Jamaican - quite exotic with accent.

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Nope

My experience/comments : I visit this place when I can as I really enjoy the Lomi-Lomi style and the girls I have had have all been very good.  I phoned up and Tina answered the phone and offered herself at a time that suited me.  Turned up to be met at the door by this most exotic dark skinned creature who turned out to be Tina.  Waled through to the usual front room on the left, handed over $100 for the hour and Tina left me to get undressed.  On her return I expected her to oil up the table before I hoped on but she said she doesn't do this - first warning.
So I hop on the table and Tina starts applying very small amounts of oil from a tiny bottle - second warning
Tina now commences a pretty lack lustre massage effort which had no connection with any lomi-lomi technique I am aware of.  At this point I asked Tina about lomi-lomi massage as this is this shop's signature product - also Tina said she doesn't do this -amazing.  I confirmed with Tina that Elle still manages the place - yes, but no, Tina doesn't do Lomi-lomi massage........ mmmmm.  Anyway, back to the actual massage Tina was delivering.  Pretty hopeless with nil sensual or erotic content.  I got a bit sick of this so raised the matter of extras and this is where it all went right down hill.  Tin won't do a HJ for $50 but she will give he a "clothes off erotic experience incl HJ" for $100 extra.  So in the spirit of TOFTT, I unwisely took the $100 option - $ up front please - and the following is my experience of Tina's "clothes off erotic experience":

To start with, her underwear stayed on (I subsequently found out this is part of her $200 option).  She spent a remarkable amount of time in front of the mirror admiring herself including practicing some dance steps in time to her music.  Tina continued my back massage for a little while with no change in technique and absolutely nil sensual or erotic content.  She then invited me to turn over.  At this stage little Ant was only slightly awake, Tina looked at me with a slight sneer and said, "can't you get hard for me".  At this stage I got quite cross and sat up.  I invited Tina to sit next to me and I pointed out to her just insulting and indeed selfish that statement was to me and in her line of business surely she realised that while her 20 something boyfriend  probably comes just at the sight of her, middle age men and older at least would appreciate some teasing first.  Yes Tina apologised and yes she did try harder, however, bottom line is - this girl has absolutely no idea about massage and I suggest she is being totally reliant on her exotic looks.  For the entire time she gave me every impression of narcissistic tendencies and once $ had changed hands, had absolutely no interest in delivering any form of quality massage before or after our little discussion .  In the end I cut the session short, had a shower and left.

Summary - Elle appears to have dropped the ball with supervision of this girl.  Poor service and $ hungry.  I used to enjoy visiting this shop.  I will NOT be returning.

The trouble with girls like Tina is that you don't know how bad they are until you've paid them.They're laughing all the way to the bank.

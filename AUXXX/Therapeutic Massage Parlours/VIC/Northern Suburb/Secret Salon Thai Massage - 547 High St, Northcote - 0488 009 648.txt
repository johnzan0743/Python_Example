My experience/comments: (Here you must give at least a general description of the experience which you have had - 25 word minimum is required to give fellow members an idea of time spent - "Ill be back" or "good value" is not a sentence or review. )

I went there one Sat nite a few weeks ago and actually had a sore back, thought I'd try something new.  The girl at reception was gorgeous & dressed in a good looking black dress/uniform type.

Went with the $30 deal.  Was shown into a front room, so I took all my clothes off & face down onto the table in the hope for some action.  Back into the room she came & placed a very small light towel over my but.

As always I elected a medium massage.  The massage was great with heaps of oil, with my sore lower back she did plenty of deep massage of my but under the towel, which was great, no tackle tinkle or work into the crack unfortunately.

After a great pure massage for 30min & nice chat, it ended.

My back was feeling great afterwards.

If your after the best massage only would highly recommend.

As it was my visit there I didn't want to ask for extras, not sure if they'd be on offer

You'd have more chance of getting a HJ from a tram driver than in this place.  A good massage but they are not using fast oil in that place.

They are still setting this place up. It used to be run buy a bunch of 20-something goth-emo types but must have changed hands. I was asked to sit down and Anna gave me a foot bath before heading into the massage room. I asked for a hard then soft (just to see what would happen). What happened was a very good hard Thai massage. The towel was then pulled down slowly in the most erotic fashion, and Anna said that the soft massage was about to start. I got an excellent soft oil massage from her, just verging on the erotic, back and front. I politely enquired about extras: no. I politely enquired about DIY (I had a raging horn by this stage): no. But that's cool. I ask the question, I get the answer, I respect it. 

This place makes me think it's potential the Lotus Day Spa of the north...

Anna works there "every day". I'm not sure if this means Mon-Fri or seven days -- I assume the former.

Cheers,
Dean

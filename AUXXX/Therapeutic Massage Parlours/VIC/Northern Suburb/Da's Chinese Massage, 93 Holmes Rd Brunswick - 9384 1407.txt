My experience/comments : 

I've been here a few times with mixed success rates. Was very keen to see if a punt here would end up on the positive side of the ledger. Rocked up, two ladies came out to meet me. The (far) older of the two (Lucky) was trying to push the virtues of Sunny (the (far) younger of the two). Wasn't that keen, as Sunny didn't do it for me, and I was getting a bad vibe. Not guy-with-billy-club-attack-me vibe, just bad punt vibe. Despite the bad vibes, went for 30 minutes with Sunny.

The TL;DR is I should have listened to my vibes.

Got into the room, undressed, in comes Sunny. She's a pleasant enough young thing, just not (to my mind) attractive or sexy in any way. I decided in for a penny in for a pound, and so gave her a hug and felt her solid arse. Ah, she says, you don't want a massage! What you want? I decided to go the reverse auction route, start off by asking for FS. 

No. 

BBBJ. 

No. 

DATY. 

No. 

CBJ. 

No. 

DFK.

No.

LFK.

No.

Nude.

Yes, but no touch pussy.

How much?

$100.

No.

In the end we settled on $60 for full nude with touching outside of pussy, and COB (which she later backed out of, and gave me $10 back afterwards) with her to let me know if some barrier had been crossed.

In the end, I managed to stimulate her enough to get her to come, but frankly my mood wasn't in it. Her HJ was pretty ordinary. It ends up that this was her first day on the job. In this shop? No, first day doing this at all. I was her second customer. Apparently #1 had ponied up $100 for a nude HJ with no touching. FMD. 

We chat a bit more. Claims to be a virgin. Looking forward to earning lots of money. Hmmm. Can't see it happening love.

The weirdest thing was that there was something that was nagging me about her skin art through out the session. Just as I was about to leave, I asked if I could see some of the art on her back again. And then it clicked. She had a tattoo of a Rubik's cube (pretty much life sized) on her shoulder, and something somewhere had gone wrong as the configuration is not possible. You can't have 10 white squares...

Pretty much summed up the whole experience. On a slightly different plane of reality.

Person's Name : Angel

Establishment : Da's Chinese Massage

Date of Visit : November 2019

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 93 Holmes Rd, Brunswick

Phone : 9384 1407

Hours of Business : 10-8 7 days

Rates : $40, $50, $60 for 30/45/60 mins

Age : 20s

Size/shape : Curvy, with D cup tits. Nice solid womanly legs.

Nationality or Ethnicity : PRC

Services Provided : Nude massage, HJ

Value for money/recommend? : Yes / no

My experience/comments : 

I think I've run out of patience with this shop. Rock up, and Angel pops out. Popping out is appropriate, because her tits were popping out of her little black dress. Seemed pretty enough. Yes please, I'll hand over my $40 for 30 minutes. There's me, or another girl, she says, or if you want to wait for 5 minutes, we can do a double! She goes into quite some detail about how nice the four hands feels. I'm on a time budget however, so decide against it.

Get into the room, and there's basically a wafty massage for 10 minutes. Her fluent English at the front counter has been replaced by, "Sorry, no speak English" when I ask the most basic questions. Come the flip, and there was massively tortured negotiations but I eventually got a $50 NHJ with massive limitations. No touch, and at one point she even asked me not to look! The HJ was a massive let-down as well, ended up with DIY.

In an effort to help people here, I asked her which days she worked in this shop.

She smiles a shy smile, "Ah sorry, no speak English."

On the way out, meet the other girl. Also in a LBD, kind of like a half-foot shorter clone of Angel. Angel's English magically improved again. There must be some kind of cage behind the plasterboard in the room that stops English. Amazing!

Both girls also reeked of cigarette smoke.

This place changed ownership about 6 months ago. It was way better under the old management.

There's a much better Thai place 50 metres around the corner on Moreland Road.

Dean " she even asked u not too look at her during the nude hj " has to be even worse than a man who recently paid a girl 30 extra for a clothed hj, and she then asked him to pay an extra 50 just too touch her over her clothed body.  There has also been a lot of reviews lately where the author has noted girls smelling of cigarette smoke.  I thought people were quitting due to the expense of these toxic products.

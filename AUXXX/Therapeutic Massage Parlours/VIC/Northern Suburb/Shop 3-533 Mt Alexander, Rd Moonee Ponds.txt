Person's Name : Anna

Establishment : Shop 3/533 Mt Alexander, Rd Moonee Ponds - no name that I could see

Date of Visit : July 2018

Phone :0452 188 665  

Address:Shop 3/533 Mt Alexander, Rd Moonee Ponds

Weblink  :  https://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_...nee-Ponds.html   - this is one of many similar Locanto ads by this shop

Wechat: pinkyrose888

Hours of Business : Locanto ads indicate 10 to 10, however when I was there on a Sunday night, they were closing @ 9pm.

Rates : $80 for 60 min, $65 for 45 min, $50 for 30 min

Age : early 20's

Size/shape : slender about 170cm tall, guessing B cup, excellent English

Nationality or Ethnicity : MLC

Services Provided : RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Perhaps

My experience/comments : I couldn't find any reviews on this place so  decided to TOFTT.  Dropped in on a Sunday night without a booking, front  door opens onto Mt Alexander Rd.  Usual flashing "massage" sign in  front window, , couldn't see any shop name.  Walked in to a small  entrance foyer, no desk or chairs and no mamasan.  After a minute Anna  comes to meet me from somewhere up the back of the shop.  She seems  quite reserved as she shows me through to a room.  Once in the room, we  agree on 45 min due to the 9pm closing time.  I hand over $ and Anna  tells me to get undressed, put clothes on chair, lay down on table and  she will be back in a minute.  Room was nicely heated and the massage  table was also heated which was a nice touch.

I follow orders and  Anna comes back with my change, asks re hard/medium/soft, covers me  with a towel and commences a kneading back/bum/leg massage through the  towel.  I try to strike up a conversation with Anna but other than  learning her name and where she is from we lapsed into silence as she  clearly was not into chatting with me.  I asked re extras .........  :"you have to pay"  was the answer.  Well good start but when I delved further, Anna was  quite off hand and and disinterested in explaining what she would do or  prices.  I eventually got out of her it was $50 HJ or $100 NHJ.  In the  interests of research, I elected to take the $50 option only.  This  extra's discussion took some time with many silences so by the time we  had agreed on a $50 HJ, Anna had comprehensively massaged my neck, back,  bum and legs, both dry through the towel and then with a small amount  of oil.  While I didn't ask, I suspect she has had proper massage  training as she appeared to know what she was doing.  I was anticipating  Anna would not bother wait any reach through TT and was therefore  pleasantly surprised when she actually gave me a quite lengthy and  erotic reach through TT session before suggesting I roll over.  Once I  was settled on my back, Anna gave me a short chest and stomach massage  before giving me a surprisingly good HJ.  Usual cleanup with tissues  then hot wet towels.  

As I got up off the massage table Anne  seemed to come out of her shell, had a lovely smile on her face (for the  first time since I had arrived), came up to me and gave me a hug and a  kiss, thanked me for being nice and asked me to come back and see her  again - she only works in this shop on Sundays BTW. I can only assume  she is quite new to this, shy and perhaps has one or more bad  experiences with punters.  I was left alone in the room to get dressed  and see myself out.  The shop does not have any brochures or business  cards - I asked.

Summary:

Shop appeared to be quite clean and well laid out with fully enclosed rooms with latchable doors.$65+50=$115 for 45min clothed RnTI  suspect Anna might open up with familiarity and I would be tempted to  repeat visit with her to find out as I found her quite attractive.

Hi Antares,

I did a review of this place a few years ago.  It wasn't memorable so have not returned.

Mods, maybe you could try and put it together with the older ones ?

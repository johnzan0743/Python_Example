Value for money/recommend? : Perhaps

My experience/comments : Dropped in without booking.  Girl behind counter asked "how long" and after I had replied "one hour", called out for "Jessie".  She then took me into the room immediately off reception, pointed to the single mattress on the floor and said "clothes off, enjoy your hour" and left me to it.  Yep no question folks, this place has all the right vibes.  I noted the mattress had a some sort of oriental patterned "throw cover" which would have been OK except it was badly oil stained.  Clothes off and a pineapple placed on top of the pile, nowhere to sit except the stained mattress cover so waited for Jessie standing up.  Jessie comes in, sweet little Thai thing with reasonable English and asks me to lie down.  I point out the stained mattress cover and she apologies and goes back out to get some extra towels to cover it - looks like they don't have spare covers.  Anyway, once Jessie has put a clean towel down, off we go.  I point out the pineapple to Jessie and get a giggle and big smile in return.

Initially Jessie gives me a 10 min kneading back massage through a towel then slides the towel off, applies oil and commences a very sensual smooth and flowing oil massage from head to toe - very nice indeed.  This went for perhaps 20 min with increasing emphasis on all sensitive areas, quite arousing.  Jessie checked from time to time that the massage was to my liking, which it was.

At the 30 min point Jessie got me to roll over and continued with the sensual oil massage on my front, again from head to toe - very nice.  My one concern at this stage was the volume of oil being applied, and how Jessie was intending to clean me up afterwards.  I can see how the mattress cover became so stained.  More on this later.

Jessie completed the massage in a very competent manner.  She clearly is well practiced in the art of massaging the male body in all areas and seemed to really enjoy what she was doing.

Once the massage was finished, Jessie left the room and came back with a small plate with 3 rolled hot and wet hand-towels on top - looked like something served up between courses to clean your hands at some restaurants.  Oh dear, I suspected this wouldn't cut it and ............. it sure didn't.  I had to send Jessie back for another 4, which she was quite happy to do.  She then said goodbye and left me to it.  I did the best clean up I could with the wet hand-towels and the dry bath towel Jessie had originally covered me with but in the end I had to dress while still oily.  The oil had a distinctive smell, all my clothes smelt of it and I needed a shower.  Not good if you have to go straight home to family/friends.

In summary, excellent massage let down by stained mattress cover and oil clean up.

WIR? Probably not due to the oil issue.  Shame because the massage was well above average.

Person's Name : Wendy

Establishment : Sukho Spa & Thai Massage

Date of Visit : March 2017

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 1/1142 Mount Alexander Road, Essendon - 03 9379 0610 Sukho Spa & Thai Massage

Hours of Business : 10am to 10pm 7 days

Rates : $75/hour 

Age : early 20s I reckon

Size/shape : Slim size 7 perhaps

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Clothed RnT 

Value for money/recommend? : Maybe

Experience/Comments : Dropped in without a booking.  One girl behind the counter - turns out to be Wendy.  As for 1 hour massage and shown through to the room next to reception.  Wendy asks me to get undressed and she will be back soon.  I notice this room opens directly into reception and when the door is open, anyone in the area can see right into the room and ones naked self lying on the futon  Not the room if you are of somewhat modest disposition  

Wendy comes back in - exposing my naked butt to the world as she does so .  We kick off with a pretty standard oil massage, nothing special either way with only limited teasing.  Wendy has good English skills and we have a nice chat.  Subject of extras comes up - standard $50 HJ is all that is on offer.

On the flip, pretty standard front massage building up to a reasonable HJ.  Again nothing special - going through the motions.  Clean up with hot wet towels and left somewhat oily under my clothes.  

WIR?  Nothing special either way with this place.  It is convenient, clean with good parking.  I won't be rushing back.

Person's Name : Pattie

Establishment : Sukho Spa & Thai Massage

Date of Visit :  November 2018

Contact Details/Address/ : 1/1142 Mount Alexander Road, Essendon - 03 9379 0610 

Weblink: Sukho - Thai Spa & Massage

Hours of Business : 10am to 10pm 7 days

Rates : $75/hour plus tips 

Age : early 20s I reckon

Size/shape : Slim size 6 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided :  RnT

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : Dropped in without booking. No-one in reception, after a minute Pattie appears, asks if I want a massage and how long.  I hand over massage fee and she shows me into the room next to reception - the one where you are fully exposed to anyone when the door is opened.  This time I noted the mattress and cover were nice and clean unlike previous visits.

Pattie comes back in, she really is a gorgeous little Thai thing with quite good English. 

Pattie applies oil and commences a very sensual smooth and flowing oil massage on my back and legs - very nice indeed for perhaps 20 min. Every so often Pattie checked that the massage was to my liking, which it was. There was no TT unfortunately.

At the half time point, Pattie got me to roll over and I asked her re extras, as expected $50 HJ and $100 NHJ. I elected for the $50 option and Pattie continued with the sensual oil massage on my front, again from head to toe with increasing attention to little Ant - very nice. Pattie didn't rush the HJ at all and she was quite skilled with this varying pressure and tempo, checking what I liked as she went.

Once the massage was finished, Pattie left the room and came back with some hot wet towels for the usual clean up.  Big improvement on previous visits.  They seem to have a lighter oil which is easier to clean up and doesn't have any smell which is great. Pattie left me alone to get dressed and was waiting for me when I came back out to reception.

Pattie works at both Essendon and Moonee Ponds shops, no set days.

Summary
They have stopped using the somewhat smelly oil which is great
Cleanliness seems to have improved
WIR?  Yes, I would return for a repeat session with Pattie.

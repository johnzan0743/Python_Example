My experience/comments : I saw this one.  It has just opened up 3 months ago, and so I thought I would take one for the team.

Massage was very good, but despite some strong indications from me (I got nude, I was rubbing her leg etc.), she kept the towel on me at all times.  Plenty of oil.  Fantastic massage but no extras.  Some guys.  Onto another MP.

Thanks Air Travel. There's been a Let's Relax over on High St Preston for a while so this might be a new branch. No extras to be had there either but I only went the once and it was a year or so back.

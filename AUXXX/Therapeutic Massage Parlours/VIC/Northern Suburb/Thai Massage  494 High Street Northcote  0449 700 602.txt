My experience/comments : 

Saw the ad, especially the bra shot and had to check it out. After a lot of pissfarting around, finally made it to the venue. (And to spoil the ending, I ended up only getting 20 minutes because she'd taken a booking 20 minutes into my session with someone else. Fair cop if I was late, but no.)

Got down onto the massage table, she'd done about two strokes of massage before she leaned over and asked if I wanted naughty massage. It ended up being $40 for a handy and $70 for a nude handy. I initially said no, but the upselling was relentless. I picture in my minds-eye the bra photo and relented. Yet another amazing feat of engineering, her bra. Once she'd removed it, the rack looked nowhere near as good.

What followed was a lacklustre handjob with her more worried about the time, and wanting to get me out before the next client arrived.

Don't bother.

Often u read adds saying "North indian", now one with " South indian".  For me it really does not matter whether it is North or South hey lol.

When will we find an Indian that promises and delivers.
I am convinced that most of us have that on our bucket list but I have yet to find one that is both attractive and provides a good - great service.
The closest I got was Gita at Far Eastern who seems to of disappeared.

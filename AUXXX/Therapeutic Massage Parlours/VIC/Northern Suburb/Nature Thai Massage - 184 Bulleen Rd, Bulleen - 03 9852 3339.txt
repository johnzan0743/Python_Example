Rates : $70 an hour

Age : 40-45

Size/shape : C cup, size 12

Services Provided : Hand Relief

Value for money/recommend? : Yes

My experience/comments : This place is local and I have dropped in a few times.  You get a good  massage for $70 an hour and I have seen a number of different ladies.   Saw Andrea last time who on first visit provided quite a sensual  massage with the promise of more.  It took three visits to Andrea for  the more to eventuate but worth the wait.  Andrea is an older lady (they  have a few younger ones but Andrea is the only one I have "clicked"  with).  No touching of her and she remained fully clothed.  Happiness  only required an extra lobster.

Nice friendly staff, clean premises with a shower if you desire.  Good  massage and good value for money with the promise of more if you are  lucky.

My experience/comments :

The first time I went here the massage was the best I'd had, with plenty of random brushes of the old fella. I enjoyed it even more when the bend your leg out to the side and rub from the groin out. On the turn, I thought that i was on a sure thing with no cover up of the old fella. Sadly it wasn't coming, but i was suspicious that it could.
On my return visit after booking the same girl Nicole, a very friendly young girl over here studying, the massage again was the best I'd had, and on the turn I put it on her again this time with success, I parted with quite a full load and $40, but she was worth every bit of it!

Wowza.
The second visit

My experience/comments : I have been to this place a couple of times and had a really good thai massage. The first couple of times I asked for extras and was declined. This time I was given a really sensual massage followed by a HJ which cost me an extra 20. The only problem is she used way too much oil so lucky they have a shower there. Would re-visit for the massage alone.

i made a booking and the lady said i could take kim was fine with that after reading i was a chance to get extras!
would have to of been the best massage ive had from one of these places lots of ball touching thought i would be getting extras for sure but was quite happy to leave it at that if nothing more came because of how good the massage was... rolled over she covered me up and i thought my luck was up then she popped the question about a happy ending and i was over the moon extra 30 she said i said no worrys was a great hj also best ive had would see her again will be going back in future

Value for money/recommend? : Yes!

My experience/comments : 
Just popped in without appointment, went for a 45min massage as I had an appointment to attend to. Walked around the back to use bathroom, has shower facilities, looks very clean. Room was well furnished too. I read the previous reviews about the massages and wasn't too fussed what was going to be offered but I was hoping to be one of the lucky ones! The place looked legit so I kept the jocks on, lay down, and she came in and asked me to take them off - "no probs" hehe. Heaps of oil, went straight to massaging the butt, and both hands going all the way down the legs. Thinking this was going well, really sensual. At one stage told me to bend my leg at my knee, and her hands went all the way around almost brushing past. She went around the front to do shoulders, then climbed onto table and hands went all the way to bum, then all the way underneath on the way up. This went on and never got the flip  She introduced herself and asked I why i didn't go for 1hr, "only $10 more". The most sensual massage I've had, really relaxing too, massage alone is worth it. No indication of extras this time...

I was asked if I wanted to keep the towel on and I opted for no....the rooms are very warm also so its not needed anyway.
The massage is very sensual and to be honest a HJ was not even needed as I was hard the entire time and pleasure was amazing.
I will go back and see how we go next time though!

Rang up today and booked with Linda with whom I had been seeing regularly before going away.
Booking taken, all good and looking forward to a great massage (which was the main reason I kept going back) and the ending that was always fantastic.
Paid money, shown to room and 5-10 minutes later a girl walks in and asks soft, medium or hard...hmm.  I told her I asked for Linda with which she walked and out and in came mammsan with the news that Linda had left!
At this stage I was pretty pissed to be honest, booking taken for Linda, turned up and paid for Linda....then no Linda.
New girl came back and didn't utter a word for the next 60 mins...quite uncomfortable to honest.  Not saying I like a full on chat, but, something would have been nice...like hello!
Anyway, massage started, hoped for the best but nothing was happening and then when she was massaging my legs and I felt the tip of her finger brush past my very flaccid member, she pulled her hand away so quick that it was like she received an electric shock...(don't think my cock has given an electric shock before!)
Overall I was massively unimpressed with the service and then then a half assed massage....
Will not return...don't like being lied to and I can get a half assed massage with no touching just about anywhere!

Thank you for sharing a disappointing experience  cycleguy1275.

You feel they should have 'fessed up about Linda, and then to make matters worse, the substitute was not up to it.

Maybe a few measured words on the way out would get you listened to and give them an opportunity to make up for what may have been a mistake (not hearing you ask for Linda).

Hours of Business : 10am-9pm

Rates : 60mins / $70 + $30 for HJ

Age : 25

Size/shape : about C Cup?

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : R&T

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, good.

My experience/comments: 
Dropped in on my way home as I had a bit of spare time. Asked if I wanted to pay by CC which is a bit of a novelty in an AMP!
Shown to a room with a good solid table. A Katie got stuck in - a reasonable job with the massage (not great not terrible) at first she asked me "hard medium soft?" My mistake was to say "hard" - she really went at it! Soon I had to yell "uncle" and she reverted to medium. Funny thing was as soon as she did I got a fair degree of crack/sack action.
On the flip she did a bit of chest and legs then offered the extra via a hand gesture- which I reciprocated and off we went.
Mind must have been on other things as the poor girl had to really work it to get me over the line - a bit of attitude was given (what's taking so long?) but based on other reviews you shouldn't take this as typical.
In the end she got me there. Quick wipe down and on my way.

Cheers

Person's Name : Bella

Establishment : 184 Bulleen Road, Bulleen

Date of Visit : 2/11/16

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 98523339

Hours of Business : 10-8

Rates : $50 for half hour + $50 for additional service

Age : mid twenties

Size/shape : slender

Nationality or Ethnicity : asian

Services Provided : massage + HJ

Value for money/recommend? : NO and NO

My experience/comments : 
Traditionally I've found that most thai places are a total waste of time and money. I don't enjoy thai style massage, and they usually offer zilch in the way of extras. But it was payday, my usual girl at my usual place had the day off, and I was restless, so I decided to roll the dice.

This business has been around for a long while, but it is still in good condition and well looked after. The shop front and interior were well cared for and professionally presented.

I was greeted by a young Thai girl in a hoodie and glasses. She took my $50 for half hour and tried again and again to upsell me to 45 minutes. I refused but this girl wouldnt give up. I diverted the conversation by asking who my therapist would be. Bella, was the answer.

Into the room and off with the kit. The tables here and a solid wooden frame, none of that fold up business, and are quite comfortable, if a little hard. The tabletop was wrapped in a clean papery cotton sheet that seemed like a mass produced disposable type. Good hygiene.

Bella came in. Short, slender. Pretty, but cold as ice. She asked if I had been here before. Yes, i lied. And if i wanted soft medium or hard. Medium was my answer. There was no warmth in her attitude or words. Not a good start to the half hour.

She covered my with a towel, climbed onto the table, and commenced the pressure point thai massage stuff that precedes oil. I've never found this pleasant. Knees and elbows digging into my kidneys aint my idea of relaxation. But i persevered.

After about 5 minutes, the towel was tucked down to cover my rear and legs. Not a good sign. Bella then oiled up and commenced a brutal attack on my back and shoulders. Elbows dragging over my shoulders, popping over muscles like speed bumps. She is definitely a professional, but a professional of a shitty style. I reminded her that I asked for medium, to which she replied with maximum attitude, "This is medium." GOD HAVE MERCY ON ANYONE WHO ASKS FOR HARD.

Then before I know it, "Thank you, all done." 
What about my legs? I say. What about my front? I say. 
"Not included in 30 minutes." 
I bought into my lie, and insisted that I've always gotten hand relief in my 30 minute sessions. 
Bella crossed her arms, huffed, and said "You pay more." 
How much more?
"$50."
Topless?
"No."
Not on your life, Bitchy Bella.
I declined and took my leave, $50 firmly  in pocket.

Depending on the girl, I'm not automatically averse to an expensive $50 HR, but not from someone as cold and rude as Bella. The demeanor and attitude of a ML is just as important, if not more so, as their massage technique. Bella failed on both counts.

If you feel like wasting $50 to $100, Bella is your girl.

Great informative review and the reason I dont go anywhere near this type of joint has just been justified again by another review. Have to disagree about the HJ though mate, I personally dont think any hj clothed topless or nude is worth $50, so good on you for walking anyway.

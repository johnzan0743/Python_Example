My experience/comments : drove past this place a few times, and the doors is usually locked even though its on a main road. i had to ring and ask them to open the door.

in comes Emi shy cute jap girl. very good massage as her technique was professional. 
found out she used to work in japan massaging female athletes?

Person's Name : Nes

Establishment : 494 High St, Northcote

Date of Visit : 17/9/2013

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : Unknown - it was open so I dropped in late at night

Hours of Business : Unsure, open until late

Rates : $40 30 mins hard Thai massage

Age : 20s

Size/shape : Slim

Nationality or Ethnicity : Thai

Services Provided : Massage only

Value for money/recommend? : Yes, but for the massage only. I don't know if this place offers extras.

My experience/comments : Driving past late at night, and thought I'd try it out. Popped out back to use the bathroom and came across a bevy of young Asian girls -- I'm happy!  One in particular caught my eye, and I was pleased to see that she was waiting for me. Then another customer came in and wanted a one hour massage, so I lost the pretty young thing, and ended up with Nes. Nes is very easy on the eye, and gave one of the best hard Thai massages I've ever had. The rooms are not wall to ceiling, so I didn't feel as though I could easily ask her if there were any extras on offer, but the massage was so good I didn't really care

This is the same owner who runs Secret Salon Thai Massage, nothings on offer I've been to both this and Secret Salon I asked for more and no was the polite response, but the massage is fantastic, if more is what you're after you need to walk 3 doors down to 486 you can get full service there.

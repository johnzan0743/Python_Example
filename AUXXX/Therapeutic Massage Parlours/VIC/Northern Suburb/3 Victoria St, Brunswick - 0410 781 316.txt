My experience/comments : 
Have been a frequent visitor with this place and really have good experience, until now. The advertised was:

- Italian (True)
- 22 years old (FALSE)
- Busty (FALSE)
- Very very pretty and sexy (FALSE)

The massage itself was really good and really fixed my lower back that's  been annoying me all weekend. The HJ was average but she is not much  into small talks. At the end I automatically gave her $20 for HJ only  and no nude, which she then asked for 50!!! I said that I'm a frequent  visitor with the other ladies and assured her that is not the case. She  then keep on insisting for 50. I am soooo pissed off that I don't even  know what to say (or write now..) that I just give it and went.

I agree tucker, the girls around Melbourne are getting very greedy. $100 for nude and HJ seems to be the norm now. And if you want to touch they want even more. I just wont pay it. I ask now what the prices are as soon as I get into the room. If it's stupid money I get dressed get my original money back and leave,

Its time to protest!

Could not agree more with the comments above about the overcharging. There are still so many places around that offer nude massage and tug for $70, some even $65, and I have seen others on here for $50, that I cannot believe peope are actually paying it. Walk out give them the message. Get a regular girl at one of those places, build up a good rapport and you can get much more for your $70.

Negotiate up front, as soon as you get in the room! You may get a few "we don't do that here" but there are plenty of other places to go to. There is no point wasting time haggling half way through a session. By then they know there is a good chance you will pay up.

You will be surprised how quickly the price drops once you are half way out of the room!

 Ria, 319 Victoria St Brunswick, 0410 781 316

Person's Name : Ria

Establishment : Massage shop, Brunswick

Date of Visit : 2 December 2014, 2.00 pm

Contact Details/Address/Weblink : 0410 781 316; 319 Victoria St Brunswick (next to the railway line 100m west of Sydney Road; 
Locanto ad:
http://melbourne.locanto.com.au/ID_1...ION-BLISS.html

The photo on Locanto is not her.

Hours of Business : 11:00am - 10:00pm 7 days

Rates : $50: clothed massage only, no touching. Extras (which all include a HJ): HJ only (clothed, no touching): +$50; topless: (with touching): +$20; naked (with touching): +$30; B2B (obviously with touching): +$50.  After paying the entry fee for a massage of $50 I opted for the clothed HJ only. So that would have been +$50.

Age : She said 24, but looked 30

Size/shape : 5' 8", medium build with a nice largish arse and thick legs. This was not surprising given she was part Brazilian. Medium sized breasts (which I never saw or touched). 

Nationality or Ethnicity : Born in Brazil; half Mauritius half Brazilian

Services Provided : Massage (clothed, topless or naked depending on what you want to pay for). HJ. No BJ or FS

Value for money/recommend? : No, a bit expensive itemising the extras rather than making them inclusive.  

My experience/comments : 

I found their site on Locanto and rang at about midday.  I was told that it was $50 for a massage and I could negotiate extras with the ML.  I was told they had ladies from Sweden, Brazil, Germany, France, Australia and 2 Asian girls working today.

I rocked up at about 2:00pm.

The place looks exactly like the Google picture, advertising "Thai Massage":

https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-37....n3OpLQTOKQ!2e0

There was a pretty average looking Aussie lady about 30-35 with alot of moles and freckles manning the front desk.  After paying my $50 she got me to wait in the waiting area at the front of the shop. I asked who was available, and she replied that there were 2 girls only, one from Australia and one from Mauritius.

Now that was odd. No Asians. And despite the phone call earlier, only 2 girls working.

I asked for the Mauritius lady.

Aussie Mamasan then took me upstairs to the massage room where I waited another 10 minutes.

Ria then arrived.

She immediately asked if I wanted extras on top of the half hour massage.  I explained after she told me the prices (see above) that I couldn't even afford a HJ as I only had $45 in my wallet and maybe I should leave.  She explained to me that she does a great B2B and I should remember that for next time.  Or I could go to the ATM up the road in Sydney Road and come back and pay her later.

I said I wasn't going to the ATM and she said she would settle for the HJ at $45. I agreed.

"But no touching!" she emphasized. "You haven't paid for that."

So Ria starts massages my back and legs.  Average massage.  Hard on the left leg (closest to her) for 5 minutes; Ria then jumps on my back to do my shoulders, which is ok, but methodical rather than hard or sensual. She then slides to the other side and starts a soft massage on the right side. 

After 15 minutes or so, Ria asks me to to turn over.  She commences soft strokes of my upper thighs, chest and stomach.  I ask, "No touching?"

"Not for what you have paid, " is the reply.

Ria then starts stroking my cock with her right hand.

"Fast or slow?" she asks.

"You are doing fine", I reply noting that she is mixing it up a bit, but otherwise it is a bit mechanical.

She takes me in her left hand and the experience is completely different.  Probably because it is her less favoured hand the touch is less mechanical and more sensuous.  She goes back to the right hand and the mechanical action resumes.

After about a minute I ask her to use her left hand and she obliges.

"You can touch me a little bit", she says, presumably to help get me over the line.

She is wearing a G-string under her dress, but what I really notice is the huge arse that she has.  Yet very firm.  I figure that is the Brazilian in her.

The left hand is doing nicely and within about two minutes we both sense that I am about to erupt.  She keeps the sensual touch going and I explode all over her hand and my chest.

Ria fetches a hot wet towel and cleans me up.  I dress, pay her the $45 and leave.

Overall, not a bad experience, but the place is pricey.

I dropped into this place today for a random dip. There was a young Chinese guy behind the front desk, with the youngish girl on the seat in the waiting area. He asked what type of massage I wanted, and I asked for full body oil. He led me into the room which was immediately adjacent to the front desk, with an opaque window in between. He asked me to remove my short and pants, but leave my underwear on, and left the room.

I took off all of my clothes, and lay down on the table. In a few minutes, the girl came in, and as soon as she saw my naked arse immediately ran out and spoke in Chinese to the guy outside. Not a good sign. He came in and said that I had to keep my underwear on. I told him that I didn't want oil on my clothes, so he draped a towel over me and tried to tuck it in!

The girl came in and gave me a light, inexperienced massage. After she had finished, she asked me if I felt better, and rather than lose it I just asked her how she learnt massage. She said that she learnt one year ago. Really!

On the way out they tried to give me a loyalty card. No Thanks. I don't mind a straight massage, but I really hate a bad one.

WIR? Only if I have a recommendation for a good known masseuse working there.

Sometimes before we start I ask if they are good at massage and they always say yes.

this place changed hands a while back and it remained fairly legit until I popped in today and heard moaning in room 2.  Met a younger girl dressed like a brothel working girl, and 2 older ones in skirts too. This shop has entered the fs market now.

Checked this out from the outside only on Sunday on my way to another place. It is actually Bu's massage not Wu's massage. The main title here says Wu's some posts have it correctly as Bu's. Maybe the main title shouldbe changed to Bu's?

it has been signwritten as Bu's but a lot of its advertising online etc is as "wu's"

i did ask once and they advised me that the correct name was "wu's" but there was a mix up with the signwriter and they never bothered to get it corrected
